NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES\nIdentify concrete investments and pivots:\n- New product launches (with timelines if mentioned)\n- Geographic expansion (specific markets)\n- M&A pipeline hints ('actively evaluating acquisitions')\n- R&D focus areas and capital allocation\n- Partnerships or joint ventures\n- Digital transformation initiatives\n\n### 3. MANAGEMENT CONFIDENCE SCORING (0-100)\nAnalyze LANGUAGE TONE to score confidence:\n\n**High Confidence (80-100):**\n- 'We are confident...', 'We expect...', 'Our strategy will...'\n- Specific timelines and metrics\n- Clear accountability statements\n\n**Medium Confidence (50-79):**\n- 'We believe...', 'We anticipate...', 'We are positioned to...'\n- Conditional statements ('if market conditions permit')\n\n**Low Confidence (0-49):**\n- 'We hope...', 'We may...', 'It is possible...'\n- Heavy use of risk disclaimers\n- Vague or non-committal language\n\n### 4. EXECUTION RISKS\nIdentify TOP 3-5 execution risks management acknowledges:\n- Supply chain dependencies\n- Regulatory hurdles\n- Competitive threats\n- Technology transitions\n- Talent/labor challenges\n- Macroeconomic exposure\n\n## OUTPUT VALIDATION\n- Only extract information EXPLICITLY stated in the text\n- Do NOT infer or hallucinate targets\n- If MD&A lacks strategic content (just numbers), return empty arrays\n- Quote exact phrases when possible for growth targets\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n{\n  \"growth_targets\": [\n    \"Achieve 10-12% annual revenue growth\",\n    \"Expand gross margin to 45% by 2026\",\n    \"Double services revenue in 3 years\"\n  ],\n  \"new_business_initiatives\": [\n    \"Launch AI assistant product in Q2 2025\",\n    \"Expand into India market with 50 new stores\",\n    \"$5B investment in semiconductor manufacturing\"\n  ],\n  \"management_confidence\": 78,\n  \"risk_assessment\": \"Key execution risks include supply chain concentration in Taiwan, regulatory scrutiny in EU/US antitrust, and competitive pressure from emerging players in AI.\"\n}",
