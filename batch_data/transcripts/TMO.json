[Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call. Kenneth Apicerno : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts & Presentations, until May 16, 2014. A copy of the press release of our 2014 first quarter earnings and future expectations is also available on our website under the heading Financial Results. So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's annual report and 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, under the caption, Risk Factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and also available in the Investors section of our website under the heading SEC Filings.

Also during the call, we'll be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our first quarter 2013 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Information. Before we get started, one other item to note is that the commentary we provide on today\u2019s call regarding the company\u2019s revenue growth by end market and geography is on an end market basis only, and therefore does not include the performance of Life Technologies. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thank you, Ken, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our Q1 call. I\u2019m pleased to report that we achieved a number of significant milestones in the first three months of the year, and our performance positions us well to meet our goals for 2014. First, as you all know, we closed on the acquisition of Life Technologies in early February. I\u2019ve spent quite a bit of time since then travelling to our new sites in the U.S. and Europe to do business reviews, hold town halls with our new colleagues, and visit our customers. I continue to be impressed by the caliber of people I meet, the innovative technologies being developed, and the passion the team has for using science to make a real difference in the world. It\u2019s also very clear to me that the life science solutions team shares our commitment to unrivaled industry leadership, and that\u2019s an important common denominator.  On the topic of integration, I\u2019m very pleased to report that our teams are implementing their plans and executing extremely well. We had a number of months to plan the integration so the team would be able to hit the ground running immediately after the close. As you know, we have a great track record of integrating acquisitions and achieving the synergies that we signed up for. We\u2019ve targeted $85 million of synergies in 2014 from the Life Technologies transaction and have no doubt that we\u2019ll accomplish that goal.  In late March, we completed the sale of the delayed divestitures that we previously announced to GE, and we received over $1 billion for our cell culture sera and media, gene modulation, and magnetic beads businesses. We were pleased to be able to complete the transaction expeditiously. The proceeds provide us with more cash to pay down our debt, and we still expect to achieve our target leverage during the third quarter of 2015, as we said on our Q4 call.  Last, but very important, our teams remain intensely focused on our customers and they executed very well to deliver solid financial results in Q1. We leveraged our top line growth and focused on controlling costs to once again continue our long trend of delivering outstanding adjusted EPS performance.  I\u2019ll now cover the financial highlights, give some commentary on end markets, hit some of the business achievements, and end with our guidance. As you saw in our press release, our results in Q1 include Life Technologies since early February and exclude the divestitures as of late March.  That said, our total revenue for the quarter grew 22% year over year. Adjusted operating income was $830 million in the quarter, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 200 basis points to 21.3%. The addition of Life Technologies businesses and our solid operational execution resulted in adjusted EPS performance of $1.53 per share. This was a 12% increase over 2013, and sets us up to deliver another year of consistently strong adjusted EPS growth. As you know, we use our PPI business system to continuously drive margin expansion and significant productivity across our global operations. In a market where we\u2019re still seeing some muted growth in certain customer segments, this is a key competitive advantage. One quick anecdote on this topic. Our laboratory equipment center of excellence in Ashville, North Carolina was recently recognized as one of the best plants in the U.S. by Industry Week magazine. I visited the plant in March to congratulate the team for the great work they\u2019ve done to achieve this distinction.  This was actually the second time one of our factories has won this award. Both plants have aggressively implemented the PPI business system across our operations and both are great examples of the impact that PPI can have. Our PPI business system is already being implemented at our new sites within life science solutions and we\u2019ll begin to see the results, which we\u2019ll highlight for you at our analyst meeting next month. Now, let me give you my perspective on our performance in the context of our four key end markets. I\u2019ll start by saying that in aggregate, our outlook for the year hasn\u2019t changed. So, beginning with academic and government, this end market started off in Q1 a little softer than what we had experienced over the past year or so, most likely due to some of our U.S. customers working fewer days. Overall, we said last quarter that these customers would probably begin spending money under the new appropriations at around midyear. Our view on that hasn\u2019t changed, and we believe this end market will improve in the second half as the funds begin to flow. Turning to diagnostics and healthcare, our performance her was relatively flat overall, reflecting the lower healthcare utilization in the U.S. that\u2019s been widely publicized. On the other hand, we had very good growth in our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses. As the year plays out and utilization increases, we expect growth for the full year to be in line with the company average. In industrial and applied, we delivered mid-single digit growth as conditions here continue to improve. You may recall that last quarter we said we believed the industrial market had begun to stabilize. To provide you with a little more color from a product perspective, we\u2019re pleased with our ongoing strength in chromatography, and we saw a nice pickup during the quarter in our portable analyzer business. Last, in pharma and biotech, we delivered high single-digit growth in the quarter, driven by continued strength in our clinical trials logistics and mass spectrometry businesses. It\u2019s clearly that our biopharma customers continue to recognize the benefits of our unique value proposition. So, in summary, as I mentioned at the beginning of my commentary, in aggregate, our outlook for the full year is consistent with our original guidance. Let me now talk about the great progress we\u2019re making strengthening our company to gain market share. As you know, we have a solid strategy for increasing share gain with our customers to drive growth. It\u2019s based on three core elements, technology innovation, our unique customer value proposition, and our scale in Asia Pacific and emerging markets. We\u2019ve followed this playbook for a number of years. It\u2019s served us well, and the acquisition of Life Technologies further enhances all three elements of our strategy. My point today is that we\u2019ll continue to execute this strategy to best serve our customers and strengthen our position as the unrivaled industry leader. In that context, let me cover some of the business highlights from the quarter. First, we kicked off the year with a lot of new products that strengthened our position as the innovation leader in our industry. Starting with Pittcon, the leading analytical instruments show, our theme this year was around helping customers run their laboratory operations more efficiently, regardless of the industry they were in. Our new[unintelligible] scientific products included instrument software, data management systems, and new additions from molecular spectroscopy and lab product offerings. To highlight two of the new launches, we released another update of our gold standard chromatography data system, Chromeleon 7.2.  This new version allows customers to control their mass spec instruments on a single data platform with gas, ion, and liquid chromatography instruments. We have good momentum in our chromatography and mass spec businesses and this industry leading software package is another step in further strengthening our competitive position. I also want to mention a small but innovative new product, the Virtuoso system for vial identification. This system prints barcodes directly on even the smallest vials to provide a data trail that could prevent the loss of valuable samples. This is a growing problem, and you may have seen the news last week about thousands of vials containing the SARS virus that were lost in a prestigious European research lab. At Analytica, we launched a number of new Thermo Scientific products that can help our laboratory and biotech customers improve productivity. Highlights included a new cell culture surface that better models cancer cell growth to accelerate research. We also introduced new systems for protecting individual samples during long term storage. Separately, we launched the Life Technologies Quantifiler Trio and HP kits for more accurate forensic analysis of highly compromised samples. Q1 also marked the launch of Ion Chef, which is used to automatically prepare DNA samples before they\u2019re loaded into the Ion Torrent gene sequencer. The key advantages of this new product are that it saves time for researchers and also reduces variability during the process to improve results. We shipped a significant number of our units to our customer base in the quarter, and early feedback is very positive. Let me now turn to our customer value proposition and give you an example from the quarter that shows how our increased [unintelligible] capabilities is a real differentiator for Thermo Fisher. We highlighted our expanded offering in bioreduction and bioprocessing at a leading biopharma manufacturing trade show called [unintelligible]. For the first time, our Thermo Scientific and Life Technologies offerings were displayed side by side in the booth. We launched several new single use technologies at the show to strengthen our leading position with this product offering. Customers could also see the embedded capabilities we now have in upstream cell culture applications, downstream [unintelligible], as well as analytics for detecting and quantifying impurities. This combination gives us a strong position with certain biopharma customers who are focused on bringing new biologics and vaccines to the market more quickly and cost effectively.  I\u2019ll make a couple of quick comments on Asia Pacific and emerging markets before wrapping up with our guidance. Let me start with China, where we recorded low double-digit growth during the quarter. We continue to have excellent momentum serving healthcare, although this is still a relatively small segment in China today. Our performance here was led by strong demand for a range of products in our specialty diagnostics businesses. As you know, we continue to increase our presence across high growth regions. We delivered good growth in India, driven by strong sales of our analytical instruments, and the addition of Life Technologies builds on our leading presence across Asia Pacific.  In Southeast Asia, for example, we plan to further leverage the manufacturing infrastructure that we now have in Singapore. I\u2019m traveling to Asia shortly, and I look forward to visiting several of our sites and spending time with some of our key customers there.  So, I think this gives you a good sense of all the opportunities we have to drive growth and the great progress we\u2019re making in the three elements of our strategy. Turning now to our annual guidance, as you saw in our press release, we\u2019re raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. The increase primarily reflects the timing of the Life Technologies acquisition and related divestitures. It also reflects a slight improvement in foreign exchange rates versus our assumption at the beginning of the year. Pete will cover the details of our guidance in his remarks, but at a high level, we\u2019re raising our revenue guidance for 2014 to a new range of $16.84 billion to $17.0 billion for 29% to 30% revenue growth year over year. We are also raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $6.80 to $6.95, which would result in 25% to 28% adjusted EPS growth over our strong performance in 2013. Before I turn the call over to Pete, let me leave you with a few takeaways. First, we closed our acquisition of Life Technologies to further strengthen our strategic position. We had a very active quarter in terms of technology innovation, with many new product launches, and we continue to build on our scale to take advantage of the growth opportunities in Asia Pacific and emerging markets. We are clearly the unrivaled leader in our industry, and that puts us in an excellent position to continue to gain share. With that, now to you, Pete. Peter Wilver : Thanks, Marc. Good morning everyone. I\u2019ll begin with an overview of our Q1 financial performance for the total company, then provide some color on each of our four segments and conclude with our updated 2014 guidance. Before I get into the details of our results, as we stated in our press release, our financial results for the quarter include Life Technologies as of February 4 and exclude the related divestitures as of March 22. As I mentioned last quarter, at the total company level, we\u2019re reporting organic revenue growth using our standard methodology. That means we\u2019ll exclude the results of Life Technologies until we reach the one-year anniversary date of the acquisition. However, for the life sciences solutions segment, which consists primarily of the Life Technologies businesses and our remaining biosciences businesses, we\u2019re providing organic revenue growth on a pro forma basis as if we had owned Life Technologies for all of 2013 and 2014. We\u2019re doing this to give you insight into the growth performance of that segment. So, starting with our overall financial performance, we delivered a solid quarter, resulting in a 12% increase in adjusted EPS to $1.53. GAAP EPS was $1.36 in Q1, up 46% from $0.93 in Q1 2013, primarily as a result of the gain on the divestitures. Starting with the top line, Q1 total revenue increased 22% year over year and we delivered 2% organic growth. Q1 reported revenue includes 20% growth from acquisitions net of divestitures and an immaterial positive impact from foreign exchange. We strengthened our backlog in the quarter with bookings exceeding revenue by 2%. By geography, North America declined organically in the low single digits, Europe grow in the mid-single digits, and Asia Pacific grew in the high single-digits, with China growing low double-digits. The rest of the world grew in the low single digits. Looking at our operational performance, Q1 adjusted operating income increased 35% and adjusted operating margin was 21.3%, up 200 basis points from Q1 last year. Our adjusted operating margin expansion for the quarter was driven primarily by the addition of Life Technologies, which had a higher overall margin rate compared to standalone Thermo Fisher. However, we also continued to see contribution from our primary productivity levers : global sourcing, site consolidations, and our PPI business system. In total, operating performance for standalone Thermo Fisher contributed about 30 basis points to adjusted operating margin expansion in the quarter. We realized benefits from our restructuring actions of $13 million in Q1 and are on track to achieve about $45 million of benefit for the full year. We also realized synergy benefits of $17 million in Q1, in line with our guidance of $85 million for full year 2014. In terms of supporting our growth initiatives, we continue to make strategic investments, primarily to strengthen our presence in emerging markets and continue our growth momentum in those regions. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.2% in Q1, up 420 basis points from the prior year. This was primarily due to the acquisition, along with solid productivity. Adjusted SG&A in Q1 was 23.1% of revenue, 140 basis points unfavorable to the 2013 quarter, again primarily as a result of the acquisition, partially offset by volume leverage and our productivity actions. Finally, R&D expense came in at 3.8% of revenue for the quarter, 70 basis points above the prior year. This reflects the relatively higher level of investment in R&D in the life sciences solution segment. R&D as a percentage of manufacturing revenue in Q1 was 6%. Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense in Q1 was $106 million, up $49 million from last year, driven primarily by the debt we raised to fund the Life Technologies acquisition. Adjusted other income for Q1 was $3 million, about the same level as Q1 last year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 16%, 430 basis points above last year. This was primarily as a result of higher than average credits in the prior year, related to foreign tax credits and the double R&D tax credit, which has not yet been approved for this year. Although this quarter\u2019s rate is slightly above our full year adjusted tax rate guidance of 14.5% to 15.5%, this was assumed in our previous guidance, as we only included a partial quarter of benefit from the acquisition tax synergies in Q1. So we\u2019re maintaining our full year adjusted tax rate guidance and we expect that our adjusted tax rate will be below the Q1 rate for the balance of the year. In terms of returning capital, we paid out $55 million in dividends to our shareholders in the quarter. Average diluted shares were 398.4 million in Q1, up 36.7 million, or 10% from last year, primarily as a result of the shares we issued to partially fund the Life Technologies acquisition and to a much lesser degree, option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, there are a lot of moving pieces, primarily related to the acquisition and related divestitures. The headline numbers for Q1 are $102 million of cash flow from continuing operations and free cash flow of only $1 million after deducting $101 million of net capital expenditures. This compares to $236 million of free cash flow in the prior year. In the quarter, we incurred $240 million of one-time payments related to the acquisition close that were netted against operating cash flow, including financing fees, transaction fees, and restructuring costs. In our acquisition model, these outflows were primarily included as upfront deal costs. Cash flow from working capital in the quarter was reduced by about $50 million as a result of the close timing and related opening balance sheet amounts, and our tax payments were $115 million higher than the prior year, primarily because of the quarterly phasing of last year\u2019s payments. This will even out through the rest of the year. So, as I said, a lot of moving pieces this quarter. We ended the quarter with $1.52 billion in cash and investments, down $4.3 billion sequentially from Q4, as a result of funding the Life Technologies acquisition. Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $17.4 billion, up $6.9 billion from Q4, as a result of drawing down our $5 billion term loan and issuing $500 million of commercial paper to fund the acquisition as well as assuming $2.3 billion of Life Technologies debt.  Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was about $1 billion higher than we need to maintain on an ongoing basis, because the divestiture proceeds were received very late in Q1. These proceeds were used to pay down debt early in Q2. Let me wrap up my comments on the total company with a quick update on our performance in terms of return on invested capital. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in the first quarter of 2014 was 9.5%, down 60 basis points from Q4, as a result of the Life Technologies acquisition. As we normally do, we\u2019ll give you a longer term view of ROIC at our analyst meeting on May 20. So, with that, now I\u2019ll walk you through the performance of our four business segments. Starting with the new life sciences solution segment, in Q1, total revenue grew significantly to $836 million from $173 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the Life Technologies acquisition net of divestitures. On a pro forma basis, assuming Life Technologies was owned for the entire quarter in both the current and prior years, organic revenue grew 1%.  In the quarter, we saw good growth in our bioprocess production business and in next gen sequencing, partially offset by a tough comparison in licensing revenues. Q1 adjusted operating income for life sciences solutions also increased significantly, primarily as a result of the acquisition, with adjusted operating margin of 550 basis points to 29.3%. Because of the timing of the acquisition close, life sciences solutions Q1 reported results include only February and March, which historically have higher margin than January, as a result of the phasing of revenue versus expenses throughout the quarter. As a result, we expect adjusted operating margin in the segment to be about 250 to 300 basis points lower in Q2 compared to Q1, but this should increase throughout the year as revenue and synergies increase. In the analytical instruments segment, in Q1 total revenue and organic revenue both grew 4%. In the quarter, we had very strong growth in our life sciences mass spec and chromatography businesses, which benefited from good performance in Europe and Asia Pac. Q1 adjusted operating income in analytical instruments increased 9%, and adjusted operating margin was 17%, up 70 basis points. The margin expansion was driven by strong pull through on top line growth and good contribution from productivity actions, partially offset by strategic growth investments and unfavorable foreign exchange. Turning to the specialty diagnostics segment, in Q1 total revenue grew 1% and organic growth was modestly positive. In the quarter, we continued to deliver good growth in our transplant diagnostics business and our immunodiagnostics business grew in the mid-single digits. As Marc noted earlier, we believe this was more than offset by weak healthcare utilization in the U.S. Adjusted operating income in the segment declined 1% in Q1, and adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, down 50 basis points from the prior year. In the segment, we delivered good productivity, but this was more than offset by strategic growth investments and some unfavorable mix. In the laboratory products and services segment, both reported revenue and organic revenue grew 2% in Q1. Our clinical trials logistics business continued to deliver very strong growth, but softness in the U.S. academic and government end market, as Marc mentioned, continued to be a headwind in this segment. Adjusted operating income in laboratory products and services grew 1% for the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 14.7%, down 10 basis points as good productivity was more than offset by strategic growth investments and unfavorable foreign exchange. So with that, I\u2019d like to review the details of our full year 2014 guidance. As you saw in our press release, on the top line, we\u2019re raising both the low and high end of our reported revenue range, primarily as a result of the acquisition and divestiture timing as well as more favorable foreign exchange. This leads to a new full year 2014 revenue guidance range of $16.84 billion to $17.0 billion, which represents growth of 29% to 30% compared to our reported revenue of $13.1 billion in 2013.  To bridge the $190 million revenue increase from the midpoint of our previous guidance, we picked up $120 million related to the acquisition, primarily as a result of an early close date than our previous assumption, $45 million as a result of more favorable FX rates on Thermo Fisher standalone, and $25 million as a result of the divestitures closing later than our previous assumption. On an organic basis, we\u2019re still guiding to standalone organic growth for full year 2014 of 3% to 4%, consistent with our previous guidance. As I mentioned earlier, this measure of organic growth does not include the results of Life Technologies. For the life sciences solution segment, we still expect 2% to 3% pro forma organic growth for full year 2014, also consistent with our previous guidance. In terms of FX, assuming recent rates, the year over year foreign currency impact on our revenue will now be slightly positive. However, we\u2019re still expecting a slightly unfavorable margin impact resulting from the mix of currencies, with the stronger euro and British pound offsetting the weaker Japanese yen, which pulls through at a much higher rate. The Life Technologies acquisition, net of related divestitures, is expected to contribute about 26 percentage points of our total revenue growth in 2014, and consistent with past practice, we haven\u2019t attempted to forecast future foreign currency exchange rates and our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures. Moving to adjusted EPS, we\u2019re also raising both the low and high end of the range, in line with the change in our revenue guidance. This results in new full year 2014 adjusted EPS guidance range of $6.80 to $6.95, which represents growth of 25% to 28% over our 2013 adjusted EPS of $5.42. To bridge the roughly $0.08 increase in adjusted EPS from the midpoint of our previous guidance, we added about $0.10 from the acquisition net of divestitures and about $0.02 from more favorable FX, which was partially offset by increased investments and some segment mix. Turning to adjusted operating margin, we\u2019re maintaining our previous guidance for the full year of 220 basis points to 250 basis points of expansion. We continue to expect solid contribution from our productivity actions and about $85 million of synergy benefit in 2014 from the Life Technologies acquisition. Moving below the line, we\u2019re expecting net interest expense to be in the range of $430 million to $440 million, up $10 million from our previous guidance. This is driven by the timing of the acquisition and divestiture close dates. Q2 interest expense will increase by about $10 million from Q1, as a result of having a full quarter of outstanding debt and then it will decrease throughout the year as we use our cash flow to pay down debt. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re still forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%, consistent with our previous guidance, and we\u2019re still assuming that we\u2019ll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders, all in the form of dividends, and that in addition to the proceeds of the divestitures, we\u2019ll use the bulk of our free cash flow to pay down short term debt. Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 402 million to 405 million, up 10% to 11% from 2013, and similar to interest expense, our share count will increase by about 4 million shares in Q2 compared to Q1, as a result of having the acquisition related shares outstanding for the full quarter.  We\u2019re still expecting net capital expenditures to be in the range of 470 million to 490 million, and in terms of free cash flow, nothing has changed in our assumptions as to our year-end cash balance or the speed at which we expect to pay down our outstanding debt. However, solely as a result of the reporting of acquisition and divestiture related cash flows, we now expect reported full year free cash flow to be about $2.2 billion, which is below our previous guidance of $2.55 billion to $2.65 billion. One final note on guidance, we don\u2019t normally provide detail other than annual guidance, but similar to last quarter, there are a lot of moving parts related to the acquisition and divestitures in our Q1 results, so I thought it would be helpful to give you some insight into what we\u2019re expecting for Q2. In terms of revenue, we\u2019re expecting Q2 to represent about 25% of our full year revenue guidance, and in terms of adjusted EPS, we\u2019re expecting Q2 as a percentage of our full year guidance to represent a couple points less than the comparable revenue percentage as a result of the acquisition synergies and revenue building throughout the year. As always, in interpreting our full year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see the year playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets during the year. In summary, we completed a number of significant milestones this quarter, while delivering solid operational results, which positions us well to achieve our financial goals for the year. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth Apicerno : Thanks, Pete. Operator, we\u2019re ready to open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from Jon Groberg of Macquarie. Jon Groberg - Macquarie Capital : I guess the first question is, North America now is going to be a slightly larger part of your revenues given life and obviously still a bit weaker. You talked about government and academic, healthcare utilization, but could you maybe give us a little bit more detail by segment what you\u2019re seeing in North America and maybe how you see that playing out throughout the remainder of the year? Marc Casper : In terms of North America, in aggregate, things were fairly similar to what we\u2019ve seen over the last year or two, with two exceptions. Healthcare utilization is typically at your peak in Q4, and at your trough, or lowest level of utilization, in Q1. So that\u2019s a pattern that started in 2013 and continues to be even a little bit more dramatic as you get to 2014. So you have that dynamic, and we expect that that improves as the year unfolds. From an academic and government perspective, the appropriations is a positive, and as we said on our original call in February, we expect funds to flow from the appropriations to happen in the second half of the year, which is kind of customary in terms of how that works. Clearly, as we\u2019ve talked to a number of our customers, they worked fewer days in the early part of the year, and that had some effect on our industry in terms of consumable demand, and that should obviously be just a one-time factor that will not repeat as the year goes on. Jon Groberg - Macquarie Capital : And what were some of the implied markets, or some of the more industrial markets in North America? Marc Casper : From a North America perspective, no really big changes. Industrial and applied continues to strengthen, and pharma and biotech continues to be an area of strength for the company. So those are clearly positives. Jon Groberg - Macquarie Capital : You mentioned Interphex, and obviously I was there and looking at the opportunities with your bag business and [Gibco]. And obviously, the more you dig into this, it looks like there\u2019s a lot of opportunity from a revenue synergy standpoint. I know it\u2019s not something you\u2019ve talked about as much in the investment community, because it\u2019s harder to get credit for it, but maybe now that you\u2019ve met with people, you\u2019re travelling around, you\u2019re examining opportunities, you\u2019re going over to Asia, I\u2019m just curious, from a revenue synergy opportunity, how are you thinking about the acquisition with Life relative to maybe where you were six months or so ago? Marc Casper : From our perspective, we\u2019re very excited about the logic of the combination and the revenue synergies that we\u2019re going to capture over time. In fact, that will be one of the themes that we cover at our analyst day. Mark Stevens will walk through some of the things that we\u2019re working towards. Not going to have a big impact in 2014. We\u2019ve assumed that there won\u2019t be any revenue synergies this year, although I assume we\u2019ll deliver something in the later half that\u2019s small. But they really ramp up in \u201915 and beyond. In the area of the one that you actually saw yourself, in Interphex, we didn\u2019t assume a lot of revenue synergies, because we\u2019re doing a divestiture and so forth, but it\u2019s a great combination of having the single use technologies from our Thermo Scientific brand being combined with the Life Technologies position in the media sera as well as the downstream analytics. So that combination should actually be quite powerful, and over time should put us in the position to gain significant share in that market segment. Other areas of revenue synergy, clearly our ecommerce capabilities are strengthened by the combination, great strength in Asia Pacific and emerging markets, and good opportunities to leverage our complementary channel strength, both our Fisher Scientific channel as well as the strength that Life Technologies brings to the company. So, lots of opportunities for the company to capture revenue synergies. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Muken with ISI Group. Ross Muken - ISI Group : I guess on the core growth number for the quarter, how did it sort of pace relative to your expectations as the quarter went on and relative to your view coming in? And how do we put in context the book-to-bill, which is not a metric we look at for you guys that often, as it\u2019s usually around one, but it was sort of particularly robust this quarter. How do we put all of that in context? Marc Casper : When we looked at our original growth outlook for the year in our guidance call at the beginning of the year, we looked at 3% to 4% organic growth for Thermo Fisher and 2% to 3% for the life sciences solutions segment. The Q1 performance, nothing has changed in terms of our expectation for the full year. We\u2019re very confident in our ability to achieve both of those milestones. When I look at the first quarter, and the question around phasing, January and February were softer than normal. March was a strengthening and obviously bookings also were much better than revenue, and that\u2019s really driven by just the timing, as customers got back to work later in the quarter. We had good bookings momentum, which gives us confidence as we continue through the year to achieve our organic growth goals. Ross Muken - ISI Group : I guess just relative to growth in China, we had run at 20% for a long time. It came down to kind of mid upper teens, and now we\u2019re kind of in the low double-digits. As you think about that geography going forward, obviously the PMIs haven\u2019t been great. It seems like the healthcare piece is quite healthy, the industrial is a lot more mixed. Any sort of pacing there or change there in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about that as a growth contributor, maybe on a near versus longer term basis? Marc Casper : You know, I\u2019m actually heading off to China next week. My view is a couple of things. One, we continue to have a very strong position. We delivered good growth, albeit a little bit slower than we have delivered over the last couple of years. Healthcare is very strong, and that\u2019s been a continuing trend. And I agree, kind of industrial is a bit mixed. I\u2019ll spend more time with the team. Basically, nothing has changed with the long term outlook in terms of our view on China. We still believe it\u2019s going to be in the range of mid-teens as the year progresses. Ross Muken - ISI Group : And one quick one for Pete. Did you call out the actually dollar contribution in the quarter? I know you gave us a net number. Are you going to be providing that so we can kind of back in? Peter Wilver : What I said is the operating performance of Thermo Fisher standalone was about 30 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. So that\u2019s really the number to look at. Ross Muken - ISI Group : I\u2019m sorry, on a revenue basis. The revenue dollars. Peter Wilver : Off the top of my head, I don\u2019t know the number. I believe it\u2019s in my script. Operator : Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan : First question, just on the pharma channel. It\u2019s obviously been a busy week in M&A world for pharma and healthcare in general. Could you maybe just talk about your view on the trajectory? I know you previously guided for a deceleration in the pharma business, but what\u2019s your latest thinking as we think about all the potential M&A here? Marc Casper : The first thing is another very strong quarter of performance in our biopharma customer set. A little bit stronger than the full year guidance that we gave in February, so the team executed well. Obviously a lot of corporate repositioning announced over the last 24 or 48 hours, with our customer set. And I think as companies look for synergies, we typically gain share. They have targets, we have incredibly strong relationships with the executive team, and we bring them ideas on how they can get higher impact for their dollars of spend. And in fact, two of the CEOs that were involved in those repositionings, and I already communicated about some opportunities, so we have very strong real time relationships with these customers. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan : And then as we think about the integration initiatives, obviously you\u2019ve highlighted PPI for your own business, can you just talk maybe about how easy it is to port over that process to the life business and other kind of big next steps? I guess you\u2019ll get into a lot of this at the analyst day, but how do we think about applying PPI to the underlying life business? Marc Casper : Even though we\u2019ve only owned the business for a couple of months, the reality is they\u2019re already starting to use our business processes, so in terms of how we operate our business. And we already have our PPI methodology being implemented. And we\u2019ll highlight some of the impacts of that, but that\u2019s something that we start right at the beginning, and start with the training, start with the impact, and it\u2019s part of the synergies that we deliver, and it\u2019s part of the ongoing productivity that we\u2019ll be able to drive for that business and certainly improve our customer experience, which positions us to accelerate growth and gain share. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan : Pete, can you quantify the weather impact? It\u2019s a tricky thing, I\u2019m sure, but I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019ve got a number you can throw out. Peter Wilver : Yeah, it\u2019s obviously not an exact science, but when we look at the weather impact, as well as the impact of seasonal products, both flu and pollen were down versus the prior year, it\u2019s about a 1 percentage point impact on the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I\u2019m getting some questions from people on the second quarter guidance, the trajectory there. I assume the midpoint of that is a little bit lower than the Street number for the EPS number, if you sort of use your math. I assume that\u2019s just all related to the timing of synergies and when things are coming through. Could you talk about your plans in terms of how you\u2019re looking at synergies and what the different phases are with that? Marc Casper : Just one thing to keep in mind, in terms of Q2, we always have a seasonal impact in Q2, because that\u2019s when we do salary increases. So that has an impact on the bottom line, and that\u2019s true for Life Technologies as well. So that could be one of the differences. In terms of the synergies, we obviously realize $17 million in Q1 already. Those were the duplicative public company costs that we were able to eliminate, pretty much on day one. And then as we go through the year, we\u2019re continuing to eliminate duplicative corporate costs, for corporate functions, and we\u2019re beginning to integrate the biosciences business, the businesses, legacy Thermo Fisher, that were combined into Life Technologies to create Life Sciences Solutions. So those will build throughout the year. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Has there been anything that sort of stuck out in Life in terms of when you got under the hood and looked for potential revenue surprises in the sense of more opportunity to develop new products, more potential downstream synergies in terms of revenue potential for the company, new product investments? I\u2019m just curious in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about the business now that you\u2019ve got your hands on it. Marc Casper : As we\u2019ve thought over the last couple of months, part of the activity is for myself and other members of the team just to get visibility to our new colleagues, visit customers jointly and really look at the opportunities. And one of the things that, to me, has been a real highlight is I spent quite a bit of time meeting with some of our new scientists - not new to the company, but new to Thermo Fisher - and they\u2019re working on great technologies. So we\u2019re bringing a really complementary suite of technologies and we\u2019re already brainstorming long term on what are the new solutions that we can bring out from combining the two companies\u2019 suites of technology capabilities. So long term, I\u2019m very excited about what both companies bring. From a customer perspective, feedback is incredibly positive. They see great synergy between the company, and the positions us the opportunity to gain share. So no surprises, but it\u2019s been very positive and the business is performing as we expected, so we\u2019re off to a good start. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company : Is there anything you could share regarding the changes in allocation of investment at Life Technologies product pipeline or commercial infrastructure you have implemented or are implementing since the deal closed? Marc Casper : From my perspective, what we do from an innovation perspective is make sure that we\u2019re maximizing the impact of our investment. Innovation is a core part of our strategy, and that\u2019s part of the reason we\u2019re meeting with our scientific leaders and scientists, just to really get an understanding of what\u2019s in the pipeline. It\u2019s business as usual right now, which is teams are working on great things, and they\u2019re doing a great job, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re focused on. And then certainly we\u2019re looking for what are the new opportunities that the combined company has going as we get later into the year and into 2015. So it\u2019s a very exciting time from a scientific and innovation perspective. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company : With One Lambda and Life under Thermo, can you just talk about the development efforts of sequence based HLA typing? This is a rapidly growing market and a lot of your biggest competitors announced earlier this year that they will be making a push into this market. So how are you thinking about competitive dynamics and the HLA sequencing market size? Marc Casper : In terms of our transplant diagnostics business, it\u2019s doing really well. It\u2019s been a great acquisition, growing well above what the acquisition model assumed in 2012, so I feel great about that. We have integrated the HLA capabilities from a sequencing perspective, that Life Technologies brought to Thermo Fisher, into that business already. So that\u2019s a combined offering that we\u2019re working on, and we feel good about our prospects in that area. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research : I was wondering if you could provide a little more color as it relates to the growth rates within the life science solutions segment, specifically if you strip out the standalone or existing Thermo business, what did that grow versus what did the Life Technologies business grow? And then my second thing was just on the analytical instruments business. I heard you said that mass spec and chromatography both saw strong growth. I was just wondering if you could talk about the remaining pace of that business and what the trends are with those products. Marc Casper : In terms of the analytical instruments business, what else is in there is a lot of our industrial chemical analysis businesses. So you obviously have great strength in chrom and mass spec, you still have some weakness in the later cycle, longer lead time products. So that would be what you see there. I was encouraged in the quarter by the strengthening in our portable instruments business. That\u2019s kind of the shorter cycle industrial business, so that saw a nice pickup in the quarter. So there\u2019s some signs of a continued economic recovery in the industrial markets. From the life sciences solutions perspective, we\u2019re already integrating that business, so we\u2019re thinking about that as one unified business as we put our biosciences business in there. The growth rates were pretty similar between what would have been legacy Thermo Fisher products and what was the Life Technologies products. So they both grew around the same rate, in aggregate. So that\u2019s the view on the splits there. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Evans from Wells Fargo Securities. Tim Evans - Wells Fargo Securities : Just to follow up there on the question from Steve, in the life science solutions business, could you maybe give us a little bit more commentary around the clinical end markets that that business serves, particularly in molecular diagnostics products or the products going into that market? Marc Casper : Maybe give a little bit more color in aggregate on the life sciences solutions segment, just to frame it, and I\u2019ll cover clinical as well in that. So when I look at the performance of the business and the outlook, first of all, we feel confident about the 2% to 3% growth organically this year.  Within life science solutions, you really have three main businesses : bioproduction, which is our fastest growing portion of the portfolio; biosciences, which is our market leading position in our high tech bioscience reagents; and you have genetic sciences, which is made up of our QPCR franchise; our applied markets, such as human identification. You have animal and food testing as well. You have our next gen sequencing business, as well as our Sanger sequencing franchise.  Within the next gen sequencing businesses, you actually have a nice clinical presence as well, as there\u2019s adoption of both those technologies there. And we continue to have good momentum in that part of our portfolio. In terms of highlights, as I thought about it for the quarter, what I would say is I was very encouraged to see that QPCR had a good quarter in terms of growth. We have really nice momentum in next gen sequencing. So I think that\u2019s a really nice complement to how the life science solutions team has started off the year. Tim Evans - Wells Fargo Securities : Given those dynamics, though, and the 1% growth, the headwind from the licensing and maybe some other pieces of the business, that must have been fairly significant. Marc Casper : Yeah, so headwinds, the OEM licensing royalties were all headwinds versus what was a strong Q1 of 2013. We saw some headwinds in portions of our Sanger sequencing business as we\u2019ll. So those would be the headwinds that we would have seen in Q1. Operator : Our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : Pete, just wondering if you could put a little color on the pricing environment this quarter and your expectations for the year in the context of your core growth guidance? Peter Wilver : In the quarter we did realize positive price, but it was between zero and 50 basis points, so pretty much consistent with what we\u2019ve seen for the last every quarter in the prior year, so slightly positive. That\u2019s basically what we\u2019re assuming for the full year, around 25 basis points. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : And then a follow up to the earlier question on pharma, the M&A activity there. If we were to compare the share gains that you typically get in these types of opportunities, against the overarching cuts that you typically see in the combined R&D budgets for those accounts, is it fair to say the net effect of those two forces is typically a positive for your business in those accounts? Marc Casper : As we\u2019ve said in years past, typically you get a little bit of a dampener as companies are figuring out exactly what they\u2019re going to be doing. But we typically then gain share, because we\u2019re part of their synergy program and they typically move spend to us as part of that process, and it nets out to be, over time, a positive for Thermo Fisher. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Knight from Janney Capital. Paul Knight - Janney Capital : Marc, you had mentioned the handheld market, and that kind of a leading indicator for these applied markets improving. Have you been surprised how slow it\u2019s taken the industrial market to improve? Marc Casper : I\u2019m not surprised. We\u2019re in this new normal of more slow recovery, economically globally. And so we\u2019re seeing the improvements now in our shorter cycle business and that\u2019s good news. And then at least we have stabilization in the longer lead time businesses. So we didn\u2019t come out of the last recession with a big springback in terms of growth, but it\u2019s something that we assumed, and we\u2019re managing through, which is why the use of PPI and managing our costs effectively positions the company so well. We\u2019ve been able to deliver great earnings growth in a muted top line environment, and we feel like we\u2019re very well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that are out there. Paul Knight - Janney Capital : And specifically, the [unintelligible] analyzer, probably in the metals mining market, you\u2019re seeing, I guess, stability there? Marc Casper : Yeah, we\u2019re seeing growth again in our handhelds, which is a good leading indicator for us. Paul Knight - Janney Capital : And then you [cite], in mass spectrometry, I think that must be what, stable pharma and biotechnology capital going into that market? Marc Casper : Those two are good drivers, plus really great products. Our products are just being adopted, so from our perspective, we have a really exciting pipeline of demand for what we launched at ASMS last year, and we\u2019re looking forward to ASMS coming up again later in the spring, and a new suite of products as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Elliott with Robert W. Baird. Jeff Elliott - Robert W. Baird: I guess just a followon to Paul\u2019s question. Can you give a little more color on where you\u2019re seeing the growth in MS and chromatography, and perhaps an update on the competitive environment? Marc Casper : Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid is doing great. High end research, academic, biopharma, extremely strong adoption. So that\u2019s been a very positive driver. From a chromatography perspective, applied markets, industrial markets, have been good for chromatography. We have strength in liquid chromatography, we have strength in [IM] chromatography in the quarter, and feel like we\u2019re well-positioned there. So those are two businesses that had very good growth in the quarter. Jeff Elliott - Robert W. Baird : And a follow up on China. Can you give a little more color on some of the growth rates you\u2019re seeing in other areas there, like some of the more applied areas, environment and whatnot? Marc Casper : I would say industrial and applied, not dramatic changes from what we\u2019ve seen over the last few quarters. We saw a little bit of a slowness in the release of funds from government customers in China, and that happens from time to time. That seemed to be a factor that played out a little bit in the quarter. Operator : Our final question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies : Pete, on the free cash flow revision, could you elaborate on the moving parts that are contemplated in the new outlook relative to the prior view? Peter Wilver : As I said, nothing has really changed in the operational side of our free cash flow guidance. But as I said, there\u2019s lots of moving pieces, just in the way that acquisitions and divestitures are reported. As I said, in Q1, we had about $240 million of payments related to the acquisition that hit free cash flow, $50 million of working capital impact.  And then just to give another example that we\u2019ll experience later in the year, the gross proceeds of the divestitures are excluded from free cash flow, but in fact the tax payments that we\u2019ll make are actually included in free cash flow. So in that case, nothing\u2019s changed in our assumption that we\u2019re going to get somewhere around $800 million net from the divestitures, but reported cash flow will take a hit of over $200 million as a result of that.  So the change is in the range of $400 million. Again, nothing operational. It doesn\u2019t change our year-end cash balance forecast or how fast we think we\u2019re going to pay down debt. It\u2019s just simply the moving pieces of how the acquisition and divestitures are reported. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies : And then Marc, you spoke to the government and academic markets in the U.S., but curious what your view would be for that end market in the European and Asian geographies. Marc Casper : Generally, Europe, in its entirety, continues to be consistent. We had mid-single digit growth in the quarter, continuing to benefit from stability. And that\u2019s been a positive. There\u2019s been some exciting R&D initiatives that are government funded that bode well for long term European demand. So I feel good about that. I don\u2019t think we mentioned this as much, but we had good position and good strength in Japan in the quarter. There\u2019s some initiatives around a tax increase that went into effect April 1 that encouraged customers to spend some money. So that\u2019s off to a good start as well. So that\u2019s a quick view on academic and government around the world.  Let me wrap it up with just a couple of quick comments. As I think back on the quarter, we made significant progress in Q1. I think we delivered solid results and positioned ourselves well to deliver another strong year. Thanks for the support of Thermo Fisher Scientific and certainly we look forward to updating you next quarter. Thanks, everyone.",

Baird Tim Evans - Wells Fargo Securities Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Thermo Fisher Scientific 2014 second quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call. Kenneth Apicerno : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts & Presentations, until August 22, 2014. A copy of the press release of our 2014 second quarter earnings and future expectations is available on our website under the heading Financial Results. So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 29, 2014, under the caption, Risk Factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and also available in the Investors section of our website under the heading SEC Filings. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our second quarter 2014 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Information. So before we get started, one other item to note is that the commentary we provide on today\u2019s call regarding the company\u2019s total revenue growth and revenue growth by end market and geography are on an organic basis only, and therefore do not include the performance of Life Technologies. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Ken, thanks and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s Q2 call. I am very pleased to report that we had an excellent quarter with strong performance on both the top and bottom line. Our teams executed very well and we are seeing the results of our growth strategy. And we continue to build on our industry leadership with investments in technology innovation and global capabilities.  We have a lot of great news to cover this morning but I\u2019ll start by reminding you that our primary financial objective is to consistently deliver strong adjusted EPS growth. And by that measure we had an outstanding Q2. Our strong revenue performance, our culture of constantly driving productivity and great execution on the Life Technologies integration extended our long track record of EPS growth.  With a solid first half behind us, we are in excellent position to deliver on our growth goals for the year. So let me turn to our Q2 financial results, then discuss our performance in the context of our end markets and geographies. I\u2019ll hit some of the business highlights and then wrap up with our guidance. I want to remind you that Q2 is the first full quarter, including Life Technologies, which is reported in our Life Sciences Solutions segment. As you saw in our press release, our total revenue for the quarter grew 33% year over year. Adjusted operating income was $924 million in the quarter and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 210 basis points to 21.4%.  As I said, we had very strong performance on the bottom line, delivering adjusted EPS of $1.72, which was a 30% increase over last year. I am really pleased with how our teams executed in the quarter, leveraging our PPI business system to translate our strong revenue performance into outstanding earnings growth. So it was an excellent quarter overall and contributed to our first half that played out better than we expected.  Let me take a couple of minutes to give you my perspective on our performance in the context of our four key end markets. I\u2019ll start by saying that our growth outlook for the full-year has improved slightly and that's because our performance in pharma and biotech in the first half of the year was a bit stronger than we expected. Aside from that, in aggregate we didn\u2019t see any significant changes in our other end markets that would alter our view for the balance of the year. So starting with pharma and biotech. As I mentioned, the end market continues to be a terrific story. Our teams are performing very well. They\u2019re doing a great job of delivering our customer value proposition and this resulted in another quarter of high single-digit growth. We saw strength in the quarter in pharma and biotech across our analytical instruments, lab equipment and consumables and our biopharma services business also continues to perform very well.  In the academic and government end market, we saw improvement in Q2 with growth in the low single digits. We said last quarter that we thought funds would begin to flow in the U.S. under the new appropriations. And that seems to be playing out. Stronger results in North America during the quarter were offset partially by weakness in China which I\u2019ll discuss in a minute.  In industrial and applied, we delivered low single digit growth again this quarter and haven't really seen any meaningful changes here since the beginning of the year. Last, in diagnostics and healthcare, we performed very well growing in the mid-single digits in Q2. Strength in the U.S. drove our results here and sales of our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostic products remained strong. So a great Q2 offset a slower Q1 resulting in a first half that was generally in line with our original expectations in this end market.  To sum up our performance overall, stronger results in pharma and biotech led to a first half that played out a bit better than we expected. As a result, we\u2019ve slightly increased our growth outlook for the full-year.  Before I move on to the business highlights, let me make a few brief remarks about our results in key geographies. First, we performed very well in North America in Q2. As I mentioned in the context of our end markets, it\u2019s especially nice to see some renewed strength in the U.S.  We also had a very good quarter in Europe with strength in our biopharma services, analytical instruments and immunodiagnostics businesses. As you saw in the press release, we\u2019re expanding our centers of excellence in Lithuania and Germany to support growth in our molecular biology and mass spectrometry products.  In China, while we had good growth in Q1, revenue performance in Q2 was flat, and this was driven by a slower release of government funds. That said, we remain confident in our growth prospects for China and recorded bookings growth in the high teens in Q2.  So to sum up our performance geographically as you know, China has historically delivered very strong growth. And in spite of the results we saw there in Q2, I am pleased that we\u2019re able to deliver strong revenue growth for the company overall. Let me shift now to highlight the great progress we\u2019re making to strengthen our leadership position, so we can best serve our customers and gain market share. As you know, we have a solid strategy for driving growth. It\u2019s based on technology innovation, our unique customer value proposition and our scale in APAC and emerging markets.  It was an excellent quarter in terms of innovation, so I\u2019ll focus my remarks there this morning. We had a number of new products that demonstrate our ongoing commitment to technology innovation. As you know, the American Society for Mass Spectrometry Conference or ASMS is always an important forum for Thermal Fisher. It's an opportunity to showcase our industry leadership and we took full advantage of that again this year.  At the show, we launched two significant new instruments, complementary software packages and new consumables that improved sample preparation. I\u2019ll start with the Q Exactive HF which was named ASMS product of the show by the industry publication Industry Business Outlook. The Q Exactive HF is an LC-MS system that builds on our highly successful Q Exactive platform by incorporating an ultra-high field Orbitrap massive analyser. It dramatically increases performance for research customers who continue to push for greater analytical speed and sensitivity to accelerate the results. The Q Exactive HF is especially suited to life-sciences applications such as protein identification and reinforces our leadership in Proteomics.  Application-specific software is critical to extending the use of mass spec and creating new market opportunities for us. We made significant inroads with biopharma customers by launching PepFinder 1.0 for Biotherapeutic protein characterization. We also launched Proteome Discoverer 2.0 which provides a wide range of bio-informatics tools and customizable workflows to accelerate protein research. Let me give you a quick example of a significant milestone recently achieved by our customers at Mass General Hospital & Harvard Medical School because it illustrates the profound impact our thermo scientific technologies are having on protein research.  Using our most advanced mass spectrometry instruments along with our customized reagents, scientists there were able to carry out comprehensive proteome analyses of 32 breast cancer cell lines in just six days. This would have taken up to 10 times longer without the integrated combination of the technologies we provided. According to the researchers, this is the first time that proteome analysis was performed on a scale previously reserved for genomics. Their achievement marks a huge step forward in the scientific community and complements the sequencing of the human genome in 2001. For customers working in applied markets, we expanded our successful TSQ 8000 triple quad offering by launching the TSQ 8000 Evo at ASMS. The system incorporates the new EvoCell technology to significantly increase productivity for customers analyzing food, environmental, pharmaceutical and forensic samples for complex compounds. It's a great example of us focusing on creating new opportunities in applied markets by giving our customers more sophisticated tools for non-targeted analysis.  I also want to mention that our GlobalFiler PCR amplification kit received approval from the FBI for use in forensics. FBI labs will use GlobalFiler to generate DNA profiles of suspects for national database that will be instrumental to helping solve crimes. Before I turn to our guidance, let me give you a brief update on the Life Technologies integration. Our teams are making very good progress executing their plans and we're now tracking ahead of our original synergy target for the year. We now expect it to achieve 100 million in synergies 2014, up from the 85 million in synergies we originally anticipated. So we\u2019re pleased to report that we are achieving the first $100 million at a faster pace and we remain confident in our overall synergy target for year three which we increased from 300 million to 350 million at our analyst meeting back in May.  Turning now to our annual guidance. As you saw on our press release, we revised our revenue guidance and are raising our adjusted EPS guidance. This is based on our solid operating performance in the first half of the year and the increased synergies from the Life Technologies integration.  The new guidance also reflects the estimated impact of the divestiture of our Cole-Parmer business which we announced last week. We expect -- we signed an agreement to sell the specialty channel for $480 million and expect to complete the transaction in Q3.  So in terms of our guidance at this point in the year, we now expect our revenues for 2014 to be in the range of $16.86 billion to $16.98 billion for 29% to 30% revenue growth year-over-year as we previously announced. We\u2019re raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $6.85 to $6.97 which now results in 26% to 29% growth over 2013.  So before I turn the call over to Pete, let me leave you with a few takeaways. First, it was an excellent quarter for us financially across-the-board, with strong performance in revenues, margins, adjusted EPS and cash flow. It\u2019s been a very strong year so far on the innovation front, and we look forward to more significant new product launches to come in the second half.  The Life Technologies integration is going very well and we increased our 2014 synergy expectations. So at this point in the year, we\u2019re on track to deliver a strong 2014.  With that, I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Peter Wilver, our CFO. Pete? Peter Wilver : Thanks, Marc. Good morning everyone. As you can see from our results, we had a strong second quarter and delivered a solid first half. Let me begin with an overview of our Q2 financial performance for the total company, then provide some color on our four segments and conclude with our updated 2014 guidance.  As a reminder, at the total company level, we\u2019re reporting organic revenue growth using our standard methodology. That means we will exclude the results of Life Technologies until we reach the one year anniversary date of the acquisition. However for the new life sciences solution segment, which consists primarily of the Life Technologies businesses and our remaining biosciences businesses, we are providing organic revenue growth on a pro forma basis, as if we had owned Life Technologies for all of 2013 and 2014, to give you some insight into the growth performance for that segment.  So starting with our overall financial performance. We delivered strong earnings growth resulting in a 30% increase in adjusted EPS to $1.72. GAAP EPS was $0.69 in Q2, down 9% from $0.76 in the prior year, primarily as a result of higher non-cash cost of sales charges related to the acquisition accounting. Looking at the top line. We delivered 5% organic revenue growth this quarter and total revenue increased 33% year-over-year. Q2 reported revenue includes 27 points of growth from acquisitions net of divestitures and a 1% positive impact from foreign exchange. We once again strengthened our backlog in the quarter with bookings exceeding revenue by 1%.  By geography, both North America and Europe grew in the mid single digits. As Marc mentioned, China was flat year-over-year resulting in Asia Pacific growth in the low single digits. Our China bookings performance in the quarter was much stronger than revenue and was up in the high teens. As a result, we\u2019re confident that revenue growth in China will be much stronger in the second half resulting in high single-digit growth for the full-year. Rest of world declined in the low single digits.  Looking at our operational performance. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 48% and adjusted operating margin was 21.4%, up 210 basis points from Q2 last year. Our adjusted operating margin expansion for the quarter was driven primarily by the Life Technologies acquisition which as you know has a higher overall margin rate compared to standalone Thermo Fisher.  However we also continue to see strong contribution from our primary productivity levers : global sourcing, site consolidations and our PPI business system. And for the first time in quite a while, we saw expansion from FX compared to the dilution we've been experiencing for the past couple of years.  We realized $23 million of synergy benefits in Q2 and $40 million through the first half. As Marc mentioned, we now expect to achieve $100 million of cost synergies for the full-year 2014, up from the $85 million we previously communicated. This is being driven primarily by accelerating corporate and functional cost reductions as well as modestly increased sourcing savings.  Our growth initiatives remain on track and we continue to make strategic investments primarily to strengthen our core technology platforms and commercial capabilities to continue our growth momentum. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 49.0% in Q2, up 480 basis points from the prior year. This was primarily due to the Life Technologies acquisition along with solid productivity across our businesses.  Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 23.4% of revenue, 140 basis points unfavorable to the 2013 quarter. Again this was primarily a result of the acquisition and was partially offset by volume leverage in our productivity actions. Finally, R&D expense came in at 4.3% of revenue for the quarter, 130 basis points above the prior year. This reflects the relatively higher level of investment in R&D and life-sciences solution segment. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q2 was 6.6%.  Looking at our results below the line. Net interest expense in Q2 was $113 million, up $56 million from last year driven primarily by the deb we raised to fund the Life Technologies acquisition. Adjusted other income for Q2 was $1 million, about the same level as last year.  Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14.3%, 130 basis points below last year primarily as a result of our acquisition tax planning. Our year-to-date tax rate was 15.1% in line with our full-year outlook of 14.5% to 15.5%.  In terms of returning capital, we paid out $60 million in dividends to our shareholders in the quarter. Average diluted shares were 403.1 million in Q2, up 39.6 million or 11% from last year primarily as a result of the shares we issued to partially fund the Life Technologies acquisition, and to a much lesser degree option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations for the first half of the year was a very strong $992 million and free cash flow was $824 million after deducting $167 million of net capital expenditures. This is up significantly from our prior year free cash flow of $650 million primarily as a result of our increased operating earnings from the acquisition, partially offset by higher acquisition related interest expense and cash payments tied to the acquisition and related divestitures which I highlighted on last quarter's call.  We ended the quarter with $600 million in cash and investments, down $900 million sequentially from Q1, as we used surplus cash on balance sheet as well as cash generated in the quarter to pay down short-term debt in Q2. As a result, our total debt at the end of Q2 was $15.6 billion, down $1.8 billion from Q1. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 4.6 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA and we remain on track to achieve our target leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times in Q3 of 2015.  So let me wrap up my comments on the total company with a quick update on our performance in terms of return on invested capital. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in the second quarter of 2014 was 9.3%, down 20 basis points from Q1 as expected, driven by the addition of another quarter of the Life Technologies investment \u2013 of adding another quarter of the Life technologies investment into the average invested capital base used in the calculation. This was partially offset by higher returns generated in the rest of the business.  So with that, now I\u2019ll walk you through the performance of our four business segments. Starting with the life sciences solution segment, in Q2 total revenue grew significantly to $1.10 billion from $181 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the Life Technologies acquisition net of divestitures.  On a pro forma basis, assuming Life technologies was owned for the entire quarter in both periods, organic revenue grew 3%. In the quarter we continued to see strong growth in our bioproduction business as well as in cell biology and next-generation sequencing, which was partially offset by lower royalties.  Q2 adjusted operating income for life sciences solution also increased significantly, primarily as a result of the acquisition with adjusted operating margin up 310 basis points to 27.1%.  In the analytical instruments segment, Q2 total revenue grew 4% and organic revenue grew 3%. In the quarter we had very strong growth in our life sciences mass spec and instruments services businesses which was partially offset by the weakness in China that Marc mentioned.  Q2 adjusted operating income in analytical instruments increase 4% and adjusted operating margin was 16.4%, down 10 basis points. We delivered very strong productivity and saw a positive contribution from FX that was more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic growth investments.  Turning to the specialty diagnostic segment, in Q2 total revenue grew 8% and organic growth was a very strong at 6%. As Marc said, we saw better market conditions in the U.S. versus the slow first quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth in our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses and our healthcare market channel had a very strong quarter as well.  Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 9% in Q2 and adjusted operating margin was 27.6%, up 30 basis points from the prior year. In the segment, we had nice pull-through on the organic growth and strong productivity which funded strategic growth investments.  In the laboratory products and services segment, Q2 reported revenue grew 7% and organic revenue grew a robust 6%. Our biopharma services business continued to deliver very strong growth and we saw a broad-based strength across the rest of the business. This segment benefited from our strong performance in the biopharma end market as well as the pickup in our US academic and government end market.  Adjusted operating income in laboratory products and services grew 8% for the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 15.2%, up 20 basis points driven by strong productivity and volume pull-through.  So with that, I\u2019d like to review the details of our full-year 2014 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we\u2019re updating our guidance for our strong performance in the first half and to reflect the divestiture of our Cole Parmer business which we announced last week. On the top line, we\u2019re tightening the range by 40 million resulting in a midpoint that's unchanged. This leads to a new full-year 2014 revenue guidance range of $16.86 billion to $16.98 billion which represents year-over-year growth of 29% to 30% consistent with our previous guidance. To bridge the pluses and minuses to the midpoint of our guidance, we added $80 million in volume, about 45 million of which was organic and another 10 million as a result of more favorable FX rates on the Thermo Fisher stand-alone businesses. These increases were fully offset by a $90 million decrease as a result of the Cole Parmer divestiture assuming a mid Q3 close date.  On an organic basis, we\u2019re still expecting standalone organic growth for full-year 2014 of 3% to 4% consistent with our previous guidance although we now expect to be somewhat higher in the range. As I mentioned earlier, this measure of organic growth does not include results of Life Technologies.  For the life sciences solutions segment, we still expect pro forma organic growth of 2% to 3% for the full-year 2014, also consistent with our previous guidance and slightly higher in the range.  In terms of FX, assuming recent rates, the year-over-year foreign-currency impact on our revenue remains slightly positive at about half a percent. In terms of margin pull-through on the FX revenue impact, we\u2019re expecting a slight improvement versus our previous guidance primarily as a result of our favorable Q2 results.  The Life technologies acquisition net of divestitures is expected to contribute about 26 percentage points of our total revenue growth in 2014, unchanged from our previous guidance. And consistent with past practice, we haven't attempted to forecast future foreign currency exchange rates and our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures other than the Cole Parmer divestiture.  Moving to adjusted EPS, we\u2019re raising both the low and high end of the range in line with the change in revenue as well as increased contribution from acquisition synergies. This leads to a new full-year 2014 adjusted EPS guidance range of $6.85 to $6.97 which now represents growth of 26% to 29% over our 2013 EPS of $5.42. To bridge the $0.04 increase in the adjusted EPS from the midpoint of our previous guidance, the acquisition including synergies is up about $0.04 and performance in standalone Thermo Fisher added about $0.03. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.03 related to the pending Cole Parmer divestiture, again assuming a mid Q3 close. Turning to adjusted operating margin, we\u2019re increasing low end and tightening the range by 10 basis points. This results in a revised guidance of 21.8% to 22% of adjusted operating margin and 230 to 250 basis points of expansion year-over-year.  As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re also increasing the synergy benefits we expect to realize in 2014 to 100 million, up 15 million from our previous guidance. The increase in 2014 is driven by realizing some synergies a bit earlier than we had originally planned and therefore does not change the 350 million of total expected synergies by year three that we outlined at our analyst meeting.  Moving below the line, we\u2019re expecting net interest expense to be in the range of 425 million to 435 million, down slightly from our previous guidance as a result of paying down debt more quickly. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re still expecting our adjusted income tax rate to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5% consistent with our previous guidance.  In terms of capital deployment, we\u2019re still assuming that we will return approximately 240 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends. And we are also assuming that in the second half we\u2019ll use the bulk of our free cash flow and the net proceeds from the Cole Parmer divestiture of approximately 340 million to pay down short-term debt.  Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 401 million to 404 million, up about 10% from 2013 and down slightly from our previous guidance. We\u2019re expecting net capital expenditures to be in the range of 460 million to 480 million, also down slightly from our previous guidance. And in terms of full-year 2014 free cash flow, we\u2019re maintaining our previous guidance of about 2.2 billion and we expect that our year-end leverage will be slightly lower as a result of using the net proceeds from the Cole Parmer divestiture to pay down debt.  However we do have a headwind versus our previous guidance of over 150 million related to the Cole Parmer divestiture as a result of lost earnings and the cash taxes we expect to pay on the taxable gain. So we\u2019ll need to perform very well in the second half to achieve this forecast.  One final note on guidance. We recognize that it\u2019s still challenging to model the newly combined company. So I thought it\u2019d be helpful to give you some insight into what we\u2019re expecting for Q3.  In terms of revenue, we\u2019re expecting Q3 to represent about 25% of our full-year revenue guidance midpoint. And in terms of adjusted EPS, we\u2019re expecting Q3 to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.70. As always, in interpreting our full-year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as they\u2019re most likely view of how we see the year playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets during the balance of the year. In summary, we delivered a very strong quarter which positions us well to achieve our financial goals for the year.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Ken. Kenneth Apicerno : Thanks, Pete. We\u2019re ready to open it up for Q&A. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Ross Muken from ISI Group. Ross Muken - ISI Group : So I wanted to start maybe a little bit of reflection on sort of the sequential shift in the business. So obviously this quarter turned out a lot better than last quarter and sort of I am sure on your mind as well as sort of investors, as you look at the key changes sequentially and how sort of the business performed, what it means for what actually happened in Q1, could you walk through maybe the two or three key things we should focus on, it seems like China is probably one of them, of what changed sequentially and is it seemed more like 1Q was really now a weather phenomenon versus anything performance wise in the business? Marc Casper : So Ross, thanks for the question. The first one I would think about is we look at the half in total, right? and say if you look at the half we feel like we are right on track from our original expectations in terms of end markets, actually slightly better and obviously we\u2019ve been raising our earnings outlook consistently throughout the year since our original guidance in January. So we feel things are playing out well. From Q1 obviously there were some headwinds that made it for a softer quarter, I thought generally the company performed well but obviously between weather and some other things, we had [ph] little lower organic growth than the target for the full year. Obviously when we look at Q2, we\u2019re ahead, in a strong quarter it averages out okay.  When you think about it sequentially between the two quarters, healthcare and diagnostics was much stronger in the quarter and we were able to maintain excellent momentum in pharma and biotech. So those are the two things sequentially worth noting when you think about it from the end market perspective. It\u2019s nice to see actually academic and government growing again, still low single digits but that was good. From a geographic perspective, when you think about, when healthcare and diagnostics is doing well and certainly with some growth in academic and government, the US performed much better. So that\u2019s the positive. The challenge was China, in terms of flat growth in the quarter. And when I look at that especially given that China has been a significant growth driver for the company for us to deliver 5% organic, with the flat China it says how well the company is performing. And within China, we still feel good about the outlook, obviously high teens bookings growth is encouraging and should lead to a stronger second half in China than what we had in the first half. Ross Muken - ISI Group : I guess maybe just if I could dig a little bit deeper on sort of China. I mean I think you\u2019re over there not too long ago. I mean if you think about the different moving parts whether it's the performances, sort of the multinational given as some of the corruption crackdown or sort of the government trying to kind of control the pacing of spend in certain regions or the pocketbook of some of the different outer regions. As you think about the sort of disconnect between raids [ph] and bookings, and you think about the pacing and what\u2019s likely to be the next thing to focus on there, what are you \u2013 how do you see those various moving parts basically kind of translating back into superior growth to what we've seen in the last quarter or two? Marc Casper : Sure. So when you look at the quarter, clearly the release of government funds was very muted relative to quite a period of time. An example of what's causing that would be very well-publicized changes in how the food safety administration is being organized, right, so an important buyer of analytical instruments in particular is going through a reorganization, right. So that's an example that clearly slowed things down. The team, as they were seeing those changes, actually focused where funds were more elusive, if you will and that\u2019s why the bookings growth is so strong. Basically they put their focus on other parts of the market segment which is exactly what I would expect the commercial team to do. So that gives us the confidence that the second half would have stronger growth than the first half.  I am heading off to China in a few weeks times, it's a very important market for the company and we have a great position there. So the changes that we are feeling right now I don't think have any long-term effect on the business and we\u2019re very confident about not only the second half but also the long-term prospects here. It\u2019s how I would think about it, Ross. Ross Muken - ISI Group : Great, thanks and Marc, jets playoffs? No playoffs. Marc Casper : Playoffs, of course, I am always bullish. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jon Groberg from Macquarie. Jon Groberg - Macquarie Capital : I guess if you think of -- Marc, if you think about \u2013 you talked about the different end markets and geographies but I guess I have heard it from a few people, few others recently this idea that given all the investment in genomics so that you\u2019re starting to see potentially kind of equal types of investments on the genomics or the proteomics side from mass spec. And I guess -- my question is, just as you look out there what are you \u2013 I guess what opportunities do you see, this incremental spend in R&D, this growth \u2013 these investments in R&D and then in SG&A, where are you making those \u2013 I guess what do you expect to see \u2013 expect the growth drivers to be over the next 6 to 12 months here? Marc Casper : So, Jon, thanks for the question. So let's start with proteomics first which is our mass spec business is doing great. We have excellent momentum in terms of the actual results in the first half of the year, results in the second quarter, bookings outlook, I went to ASMS, I saw a few of you there, fabulous conference for Thermo Fisher. That's obviously the expectation we set every year but it\u2019s nice to actually deliver on it year in and year out and we are dominating that field and doing a great job. And when you have organizations like Harvard Medical School and Mass General using the instrumentation to do totally new types of research, that's opening up more high-end opportunities which is great, but we\u2019re also seeing strength in some of the more applications driven opportunities as well, kind of your environmental food safety, routine pharmaceutical work and that\u2019s why we have some new applied instruments as well.  There is clearly lots of interest in on the genomics side as well and we had a good quarter in terms of growth in our next-gen sequencing business. So I feel good about that opportunity. So things that we\u2019re focusing on obviously is innovation, big emphasis on next gen, big emphasis on life sciences mass spec, chromatography, we\u2019re very excited about. Asia-Pacific, very important to us, in or value proposition, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive our growth for the foreseeable future. Jon Groberg - Macquarie Capital : Okay, and if I could just follow up on thinking about the portfolio little bit. Can you maybe talk about your rationale for divesting Cole Parmer? I mean it seems to be a third party distributor, kind of like some of your other channels, and are there other things that you're looking out there from a divestiture standpoint that you can share? Thanks. Marc Casper : Yes, so, Jon, so two big questions there. So first in terms of we have other divestitures in the queue, the answer is no. Nothing, nothing planned and certainly nothing materially there, so in terms of why the divestiture of Cole Parmer. It\u2019s one business that actually \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really ever talked about in the many years but it's a niche specialty channel. It was purchased by Fisher Scientific when the company was purely a channel business. We ran it separately from the other channels because there was less opportunity to sell. Our Thermo Scientific self-manufactured products through the channel and we felt like it was appropriate timeframe to sell that particular business because of the really separate from our channel business, separate from our self-manufacturing business and thought that selling it made the most sense. And we\u2019re going to use the proceeds, as Pete said, to repay debt more quickly. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So Marc, can you go \u2013 I am a little bit surprised, I am pleasantly surprised by the 6% growth in the LPS business which I haven't seen numbers like that for a while. Can you give us a little bit more color on the segments, what lab products, biopharma and the research and specialty market channels grew, I know you don\u2019t usually give that color of detail, I just wonder just qualitative on this, I am just curious in terms of where the strength was? Marc Casper : Very strong quarter, biopharma service is a great business, it\u2019s been doing great for a long period of time, continues to do well. So that\u2019s no change in the trend. Pharmaceutical companies continue to outsource that activity to us, we\u2019re the low-cost provider, the high-quality provider, so it\u2019s a terrific business. Our channel business had a good quarter, our lab consumables business had a good quarter, our lab equipment business had a good quarter. So each of the components of lab products and services did well. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just I will have one follow up. I\u2019ve had some questions lately from people asking about alternative lab channels, things in the catalog business, particularly like Amazon some of these things. I mean have you seen any impact at all from some of these other venues trying to the muscle in on the catalog business? Marc Casper : No, we haven't seen any impact. We obviously take all competitors very seriously and I think Alan Malus did a really nice job with the analyst meeting articulating how we\u2019re leveraging the added strength in our e-business approach that Life technologies brought to the company to make it even better channel to market. So \u2013 but we take all competition seriously and \u2013 but we haven\u2019t seen any effect there. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan: Given the momentum coming out of the quarter, I am wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the expectations in the back half of the year in particular on pharma. You talked about some momentum in biopharma services, previously you talked about a little bit of an anticipated slowdown in that business. So can you maybe talk about what\u2019s baked in the guidance for pharma? And then also can you quantify what you're expecting in China in the back half of the year, you talked about it rebound to double digits previously so? Marc Casper : So Tycho, starting with the back half of the year for pharma and biotech, our comparisons get more challenging, so we\u2019re assuming mid single digit growth in the back half of the year. That would lead in aggregate for the full year for pharma and biotech for us to be mid to high single-digit growth. And if you recall back to our January guidance we assumed mid single-digit growth. So little bit better outlook for that segment, or that customer set in total.  In terms of China, we\u2019re assuming high single-digit growth for the full year. We had mid-single digit growth in the first half of year, so that\u2019s implying a stronger second half of the year based on the strong bookings performance we just delivered. Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay and then on your comments earlier on proteomics, post the ASMS, you announced the [indiscernible] system, can you talk a little bit about your strategy on the chromatography side, are you making a bigger push here, on particularly around UPLC? Marc Casper : So Tycho, in terms of \u2013 after the quarter closed, we launched our next generation UHPLC, I will save the detailed victory lap for our October remarks, but I will give you a little bit of a highlight. So we acquired Dionex a few years ago, the business has done well for us. We took the R&D teams from legacy Dionex and Thermo Fisher and we really have brought out a fabulous new UHPLC which we launched around July 15 and we think it's a very meaningful product launch and it\u2019s going after a large market where we have a presence but we\u2019re not the industry leader and we\u2019re targeted at gaining some market share there. Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan: And then one last one, you talked about potentially looking at some bolt-ons before 3Q \u201915, when you\u2019re going to start to more fully utilize capital fund, just any thoughts on the tuck-in environment right now? Marc Casper : There\u2019s certainly some things out there but nothing significant and \u2013 there is some activity level, you\u2019ve seen some things announced in the marketplace and we did a small food and animal health deal last quarter, very small and -- but it's not super active right now is the way I would characterize it. And again as I said in the past that if something looked exciting and compelling and create a shareholder value, we would consider it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company: So actually maybe building off of that last question, you\u2019d previously talked about getting down to 2.5, 3 times debt to EBITDA by Q3, you reiterated that this morning. But when you look at the Cole Parmer divestiture, synergy is tracking ahead of plan and looking at this quarter where you had a really strong cash flow performance and paid down debt at a pretty good good cliff. It does seem at least mathematically increasingly possible that you get to closer to 3 times in the first half maybe in the \u2013 maybe even in the first quarter with a couple other \u2013 couple more strong quarters. Would you agree? And if so, at what point would you declare that you can actually confidently do a little bit better than previous guidance? Peter Wilver : So I will take that one. So when you look at the forecast certainly adding 340 million of proceeds net from the Cole Parmer divestiture gets us earlier in Q3 but it doesn't necessarily pull us into the first half. Seasonally first quarter cash flow is generally weak, obviously it was very weak this year but we don't expect that next year. So when you look at first half versus second half free cash flow, it doesn\u2019t necessarily flow pro rata. I would say we\u2019re down to early in Q3 at this point. But we\u2019re not into the first quarter anything like that. Marc Casper : Obviously we\u2019re driving our cash flow hard, we\u2019re focused on debt repayment. This company is focused on creating shareholder value. If we can get there sooner, we well but just as we modeled it out right now we think Q3 is a reasonable assumption. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company: Maybe I can just ask another China question. So if we think back to Q1 earnings season, you really only had about two or three companies across the group talked of challenges in China related to the delayed release of government funds. Thermo wasn\u2019t one of them, as I remember that. And then over the course of the quarter, if anything I kind of got the sense that you guys downplayed this dynamic and it seems like maybe something at the end of the quarter just didn\u2019t come in the way that you expected. So I just want to get your take on that, really specifically, when did you start to see this slowdown, how broad is it across the different segments? And you did reference the high teens bookings in China and clearly your guidance as you talked about assumes that these bookings come through in the second half as you talked about high single-digit growth for the year. But if anything it seems like you didn\u2019t bump up Q3 guidance at least relative to how the Street has been modeling things. So it\u2019s not necessarily clear that you assume that\u2019s come through in some bullish in Q3, maybe more Q4 than Q3, is that the case? Really the questions are when did you see a slowdown, how broadly is this impacting you by segment in China, and do you have a lot of visibility on when this comes through in the second half? Marc Casper : It\u2019s a good question. So lot too, I guess so I would say it is very straightforward, some of the bookings that we had in Q2 shipped in Q3, some shipped in Q4. So it's not as if you get everything over the next [ph] quarter, some of them are the longer lead time items. So it\u2019s a balance between the two quarters. So the strong bookings growth helped the second half of the year, it doesn\u2019t particular favour Q3 versus Q4. When you think about the view on the quarter, we didn\u2019t really talk much to my recollection about China other than on the earnings call, at the analyst meeting, you talked really just about the long-term, talked about the five year outlook for China, I don\u2019t recall talked much about it in the quarter one way or the other. We didn't see in the second and third months, obviously we had the first two weeks of benefit which seemed okay when we started the quarter. But when we did our call, but after that it wasn\u2019t particularly strong throughout the quarter. So it wasn\u2019t as if we had something happened at the end of the quarter per se, it\u2019s just government was slow in releasing funds, and that was \u2013 food safety is the biggest driver but there has been a skittishness on government spending or release of funds fairly broad-based across the economy. And I think that\u2019s actually been extraordinarily well publicized in terms of some of the things going on there. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : Marc, could you maybe talk a little bit about Europe, that\u2019s probably one region that hasn\u2019t got a lot of attention here. I am curious about the performance you saw and then maybe outlook for the back half of the year? Marc Casper : So Europe had a very strong quarter, feel so good about the performance broad-based, biopharma services did well, our instruments businesses did good well. There is excitement around the horizon 2020 funding. It's actually things are continuing to improve, so that's good. For the full-year we\u2019re expecting the growth to be in the range of the company average and so slightly better than our original assumption. So if you think about it geographically, Isaac, the US and Europe outlook for the full year is slightly better than our original thoughts, and obviously China a little bit weaker but the net of it from geographically it was obviously still a little stronger in aggregate. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : And just a follow up on the guidance assumptions, if we look at the guidance you gave us for 3Q revenue, it does imply a pretty solid fourth quarter growth rate again this year. If you could give us a little bit of color as to what gives you confidence that you can do, it looks like to me that you had something like 4% organic on a 6% comp? Peter Wilver : No, its actually pretty, pretty balanced in terms of the stack comp. So there's deceleration assumed in Q4 organic growth from Q3. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : The deceleration sequentially? Peter Wilver : Sequentially from Q3 to Q4, yeah. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Capital Markets. Paul Knight - Janney Capital : Hi Marc, some customers have been saying the Ion PGM assays, there are some new development, more products they are seeing. Are you accelerating new product that -- with the Ion PGM or is it kind of the same pace in the past? Marc Casper : So Paul, thanks for the question. So in terms of next gen sequencing, there is a lot of buzz around the PGM these days because there is work in the clinical trials area for oncology using the platform for matching patients to the right drug for various cancer types. So that\u2019s kind of a lot of buzz, when I was at the American Society of Clinical Oncology in June, that was clearly a lot of \u2013 actually that was the most important buzz in that particular conference, around anything in next gen sequencing because that\u2019s really where the clinical application is. So yes, there is products being developed and launched and a lot of good feedback on that product line. Paul Knight - Janney Capital : And then service business does seem to have been slower than other parts of Thermo Fisher, any color there? Marc Casper : Pete will hit that a little bit. Peter Wilver : Yeah, we actually had a pretty strong growth in services certainly in the quarter. As I mentioned in analytical instruments, we had as one of the first times you\u2019ve actually called out our service business in that segment. So we had very strong growth there. So it was actually on the strong side. Paul Knight - Janney Capital : Analytical did have a good quarter versus the last four, five, six, is this the economic cycle we\u2019re seeing in analytical or academic, do you have any thoughts there, Pete or Marc? Marc Casper : Yes, so when you look at the growth in the quarter, all the China government release of funds is most felt in our instrument business because we have very very strong position there. It\u2019s a high percentage of that business\u2019 total revenue mix. So while the growth was pretty good, it was a little bit less than the full-year target, really it\u2019s driven by what\u2019s going on in China. The enterprise services business which is also part of that segment did very well, so that\u2019s obviously encouraging. And there is -- a question was asked earlier, we just launched a new UHPLC product line after the quarter end, which also will help us in the second half. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Dan Arias from Citi. Dan Arias - Citi: If I could just go back to China funding one more time, on the environmental monitoring business, can you just make a quick comment on where we are in terms of tapping into the money that's being devoted to air quality? I think we\u2019re coming up on a year since the government announced the big investment in that area. So with the idea of going where the funds are flowing, how open has the spigot been there and just knowing that that\u2019s been one of your stronger applications? Marc Casper : We\u2019re focusing on tier 3 and tier 4 cities now in installing the air monitoring network in the country. So it\u2019s well into implementation. So we did two years ago kind of tier 1, last year kind of tier 2 cities and now we are into the broad market. EPM, the environmental processing business grew in the quarter, so that was encouraging. And I would say that amazingly how time flies, soon we will be getting into the servicing aspect of those instruments and kind of the recurring stream of revenue which will be exciting as well. Dan Arias - Citi: Maybe just a hypothetical on op expenses in the context, Marc, of your comment on proteomics and genomics. If the stronger top line did allow you to invest a little bit more in incremental R&D, which of the businesses do you think you'd be more apt to allocate to? Marc Casper : So right now we did invest a little bit of additional funds based on our strong performance and are allocating some additional funds for the second half of the year. We want to make sure that in our life-sciences solution segment that we have very good growth prospects for the mid to long-term. So the 3% growth that we set as our target, was actually stepped from where the business was performing, I am very pleased with the 3% in the quarter, but we\u2019re making some investments to soar up that area of the business and then of course in other parts of the company like chrom and mass spec we\u2019re making investments to capitalize on those opportunities as well. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird. Jeff Elliott - Robert W. Baird: Marc, can you give a little more color on what you're seeing in the rest of world area? Marc Casper : Yeah in terms of rest of world, a softer quarter, it's a very very lumpy business because there are substantial tenders primarily in the mining sector, interestingly enough it was very big in parts of South America that drive that. So a little bit of a softer quarter but expect it to be for the full-year kind of in the mid to high single-digit growth range. Brazil was soft in the quarter but generally we feel like the outlook is good for the full-year. Jeff Elliott - Robert W. Baird: Got it. And Pete, looking at the life sciences business, could you care to guess what the pro forma op margin performance would have been had you owned that business both years? Peter Wilver : To be honest with you, we haven't calculated that number. I mean obviously a significant portion of the year-over-year increase is a result of the just adding the number in, but as I said we picked up in the quarter $23 million of acquisition synergies which is actions that we've taken as a business and the life-sciences solutions segment does productivity and sourcing and restructuring and all those things just the same way as the rest of the business does. So they are driving productivity in addition to just the addition of the Life Technologies numbers. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. Tim Evans - Wells Fargo Securities : Just wanted to dig into the biopharma services business a little bit. Do you have any thoughts on what the penetration rate in this service area would be? Just trying to get a sense for what inning we might be in of this pretty substantial growth phase for that business. Marc Casper : The business -- it's hard to define the exact penetration rate because the customer base is actually -- is expanding the definition of what we\u2019re doing with them which is interesting. I mean part of it is we continue to add service lines but we\u2019ve had customers say you do this so well, we like you to do syringe work with us, where we might have been doing other types of outsourcing works. So the market keeps expanding but when we just did our strategic plan review which is a five your outlook for that business, growth prospects look fabulous. So I don\u2019t know what my baseball analogy is but we are using football as we\u2019re almost at training camp time is probably the end of the first quarter with three quarters to go. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research : Just wondering if you could clarify a couple of things for me as it relates to the guidance? Just looking through things it looks like your interest expense for the year has come down a little bit, your share count's come down a little bit, FX is a little bit better than expected. You mentioned that there is maybe a $0.04 benefit from acquisitions relative to what you were thinking before. I understand the Cole-Parmer divestiture impact, but I'm just wondering, with only raising the high end of the guidance by $0.02, is there a little bit of extra conservatism built into the guidance now? Peter Wilver : No, I would say there's less conservatism built in than there was before. When you look at it we\u2019re raising the midpoint by $0.04 and then we have $0.03 from the Cole Parmer divestiture, so that\u2019s $0.07, if you look at kind of the actual versus consensus in Q2 about $0.02 of that was tax rate which doesn't affect the full-year. So you get pretty close to the $0.10 being added in to the full-year. So that reflects our good performance in Q2, and are basically carrying through that performance into the full year. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research : And then just the final thing is on China, what gives you the confidence or what could prevent the business in China not being delayed for another quarter or for another six months? Do you have confidence that as that business starts to come back here in the third quarter? Marc Casper : The team is very experienced with a great track record. In the quarter that we had, we didn\u2019t have cancellations, in that sort, so usually when bookings happen they ship. I mean so from that perspective, we have high confidence that the business is going to perform. It is a centrally controlled economies, so if the government wants to do something different anything is possible but that wouldn\u2019t be available a Thermo Fisher specific thing, that will be a major macroeconomic factor which no one is predicting. So I would say we feel good about the outlook in China, Steve. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research : Okay, thanks. Marc Casper : All right. Let me wrap it up. We had a very strong Q2, it puts us right on track at the halfway point of the year and positions is to achieve a very strong 2014. As always, thanks for your support of Thermo Fisher and we look forward to updating you our progress next quarter. Operator : Thank you for joining. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Baird Dan Arias - Citigroup Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Thermo Fisher Scientific 2014 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Kenneth Apicerno :  Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts & Presentations, until November 21, 2014. A copy of the press release of our 2014 third quarter earnings and future expectations is also available on our website under the heading Financial Results. So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 28, 2014, under the caption, Risk Factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and also available in the Investors section of our website under the heading SEC Filings. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today. Also during this call, we'll be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our third quarter 2014 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Information.  Also before we get started, one other item to note is that the commentary we provide on today\u2019s call regarding the company\u2019s total revenue growth and revenue growth by end market and geography are on an organic basis only, and therefore do not include the performance of Life Technologies.  So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : : I am also pleased to report that our integration of Life Technologies is progressing ahead of our expectations. I'll cover more on these highlights later in my remarks, but first let me start with the financials. As you saw in our press release, our total revenue for the quarter grew 31% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income was $915 million in Q3 and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 250 basis points to 21.9%. Turning to our adjusted EPS performance, we delivered another outstanding quarter with 32% growth in adjusted EPS to $1.71 per share. Our team effectively leveraged our top line growth and drove excellent productivity to the operational discipline of our PPI business system. This resulted in outstanding performance on the bottom line. We also generated good cash flow in Q3. We're continuing to use our strong cash flow to pay down debt and we're on track to reach our target leverage by Q3 of 2015. As we move into 2015, we intend to resume our strategy of disciplined capital deployment. As you know this is a combination of strengthening our strategic position through M&A and retuning capital to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends. I'll now turn to our four key end markets and give you some color on what we saw relative to our overall growth in the quarter. At a high level, we delivered mid single digit growth in three of our end markets and similar to last quarter academic and government grew in the low single digits. Industrial and applied markets our performance here was stronger in Q3 than in the first half of the year. To give you a couple of the highlights. First, we had good performance in our channel, with some nice wins from industrial customers who are recognizing the benefits of our customer value proposition. In addition, our chromatography business reported good growth. In diagnostics and healthcare, we performed well again this quarter. The dynamic in this end market was pretty similar to what we saw in Q2. Our clinical diagnostics businesses had another good quarter with continued strong sales of our biomarker tests. And our growth in immunodiagnostics business was very strong driven largely by demand for allergy tests. In particular, our [Vue] [ph] allergy test has been well received and is growing rapidly. This is a test that we developed for our Japanese customer base and launched at the beginning of the year. Turning to pharma and biotech. We saw good growth from this customer set in the quarter and our biopharma services business continues to perform well. One recent development in this end market that we're excited about is our new partnership with long time customers GSK and Pfizer. We signed an agreement with them to develop a universal next gen sequencing oncology test that could service a companion diagnostic for multiple drug programs. The goal of the diagnostic is to enable a comprehensive set of analysis of multiple and relevant genetic markers using a single test. With this information cancer patients could potentially benefit from therapies that are much more targeted to their tumor\u2019s genetic profile. In academic and government conditions were very similar to Q2, with year-over-year improvement in North America, offset by weakness in China. So before I move on to the business highlights, let me give you some commentary from a geographic perspective. At a high level we haven\u2019t seen any significant changes in our key geographies since last quarter. With that said, I do want to make comment on China. Our growth in China in Q3 was in the low single digits. A little better than Q2, but below what we included in our previous guidance. This was due to the slow release of funding by the Chinese government which is impacting revenue. The good news is that despite the conditions in China we again delivered mid single digit growth for the company overall. This speaks to the advantages we have through our global geographic coverage, diverse end markets and strength of our value proposition. Let me now shift to highlight some of the exciting new products we launched in the quarter that strengthened our leadership position and creates new opportunities for us to gain market share. As you know, innovation is a core element of our growth strategy and we\u2019ve had a very strong year of new product introductions across our technology portfolio. Early in Q3 we launched a breakthrough UHPLC system, the Thermo Scientific Vanquish. This is a significant technology advancement because it solves two key issues for our customers in the applied markets. First, these customers need exceptional accuracy and precision as they separate out individual components and their samples. And second, they need to run their analysis faster to improve productivity and manage the high volume of samples in their labs. We also launched new Accucore columns that are specifically designed to optimize performance on the Vanquish system. Of course Vanquish runs on our to gold-standard Chromeleon chromatography data system making it a simple but highly effective tool for customers working in food safety, industrial or biopharma labs. In our Life Sciences Solutions business an important part of the integrations strategy is to accelerate growth by increasing the impact of new product launches. In the quarter we launched the Attune Acoustic Flow \u2013 Acoustic Focusing Flow Cytometer, which offers Life Science researchers both high sensitivity and high throughput for cell analysis. I was out with our team in Eugene, Oregon in August and it was great to see their excitement around this new generation technology. Attune is designed to provide multiple capabilities as single instrument, providing a cost effective and virtual solution for customer application ranging from biomarker discovery to cancer research. I also want to highlight several examples in the quarter that illustrate how we're supporting a growing trend that we talked about a lot. The convergence of life sciences tools and diagnostics. At AACC, the leading Expo in North America for clinical customers, we showcased expanded diagnostic offering of specialty assays, analytical instrument and genetic analysis technologies. We featured our ImmunoCAP and EliA test for allergy and autoimmunity testing, as well assays for drugs-of-abuse and transplant monitoring. For the first time we launched new analytical instruments in software that are now listed with FDA as Class I medical devices for clinical use. The Prelude MD HPLC, the Endura MD mass spectrometer and the ClinQuan MD software. In our next gen sequencing portfolio we showcased the Ion Torrent PGM and recently launched Ion Chef sample prep although at the time both instruments were intended for research use only. Since then however, we introduced the Ion PGM Dx system in both the US and Europe for clinical use. The PGM Dx will enable our clinical customers to more easily develop and implement new next gen sequencing diagnostic assays in their laboratories. This means they will be able to simultaneously screen hundreds of genes from patients samples with the rapid turnaround with tough time required in a clinical study. All of these new products are great examples of how we fulfill our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. Another example of this is our involvement in the Ebola crisis. We're helping our customer whether they are in government agencies, hospital or industry to get the products they need to contain this global threat. We're providing a steady supply of necessary reagents to public health labs. Here in the US and globally that are screening to positively identify a Ebola in patients who show symptoms. These reagents are used in combination with two independent Ebola assays developed by the CDC and the DOD, both have received emergency used authorization. We also have more then 400 of our Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx, qPCR platforms in labs around the world that have been authorized to run these tasks. Before I turn to our guidance, let me give you quick update on the Life Technologies integration. Our teams continue to make excellent progress implementing their plans and the revenue growth of our Life Sciences Solutions business is right in line with our acquisition assumptions. Last quarter you'll recall that we increased our expected synergies for 2014 to $100 million from the $85 million we announced when we closed the deal. I am pleased to say that we now expect to deliver a little more than a $100 million by the end of the year to accelerating some cost synergy actions. We also remain confident in overall adjusted operating income synergy target of $350 million for the year three which we highlighted at our May Analyst meeting. Turning now to our annual guidance. As you saw on our press release, we've updated our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance, primarily on the recent unfavorable changes in FX. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $16.74 billion to $16.82 billion which leads to 28% growth over 2013. This led us to tighten our adjusted EPS range to $6.87 to $6.95 for a 27% to 28% growth in 2014. The key point I want to make here is that despite the FX headwinds we maintained the mid point of our adjusted EPS range. Before turn the call over to Pete, let me leave you with a few thoughts about where we are at this point in the year. In terms of our top line growth, while certain emerging markets have been weaker than expected, we delivered solid growth for the company overall. The Life technologies integration continues to progress very smoothly. Finally, our strong financial performance over the past nine months and our intense focus on driving operational improvements are keeping us on track to achieve our adjusted EPS goal for the year. All of these achievements create a solid foundation for a strong 2015. , : Pete Wilver : Thanks, Marc. Good morning everyone. As usual, I'll begin with an overview of our total company Q3 financial performance, then provide some color on our four segments and conclude with a detailed review of our updated 2014 guidance. As a reminder, at the total company level, we\u2019re reporting organic revenue growth using our standard methodology. That means we'll exclude the results of Life Technologies until we reach the one year anniversary date of the acquisition in early 2015. However as we\u2019ve mentioned before for the Life Sciences Solution segment, we're providing organic revenue growth on a pro forma basis, as if we had owned Life Technologies for all of 2013 and 2014, to give you some insight into the growth performance of that segment. Additionally our results exclude Cole-Parmer from the date of the divestiture, August 15, consistent with our previous guidance. So starting with our overall financial performance. We grew adjusted EPS by 32% to $1.71. GAAP EPS was $1.17 in Q3, up 36% from $0.86 in the prior year. Looking at the top line. We delivered 4% organic revenue growth this quarter and total revenue increased 31% year-over-year. Q3 reported revenue includes 27 points of growth from acquisitions net of divestitures and an immaterial impact from foreign exchange. We strengthened our backlog slightly in the quarter with bookings a bit higher than revenue. By geography, North America grew in the mid single digits and Europe grew in the high single digits. Asia Pacific grew in the low single digits with China also growing in the low single digits as Marc mentioned. Rest of the world was mix, but in aggregate declined in the low single digits. Looking at our operational performance. Q3 adjusted operating income increased 48% and adjusted operating margin was 21.9%, up 250 basis points from Q3 last year. Our adjusted operating margin expansion for the quarter was driven primarily by the Life Technologies acquisition and achieving the related synergies. That said, we also continue to see strong contribution from our primary productivity levers : global sourcing, site consolidations and our PPI business system. We had margin expansion from FX in the third quarter, but we expect FX to be dilutive to our margin in the fourth quarter due to the significant strengthening of the dollar versus our major currencies at the end of Q3 and into early Q4. We realized $33 million of synergy benefits in Q3 and $73 million year-to-date. This puts us on track to slightly exceed the $100 million cost synergies we were targeting for full year 2014. During the quarter we continue to make strategic investments primarily to strengthen our core technology platforms and commercial capabilities to accelerate growth. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 49.1% in Q3, up 510 basis points from the prior year. This was primarily due to the addition of Life Technologies along with solid productivity across our businesses. Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 22.9% of revenue, which is a 130 basis points unfavorable to 2013 quarter. Again this is primarily a result of the acquisition and was partially offset by volume leverage in our synergy and productivity actions. Finally, R&D expense came in at 4.2% of revenue for the quarter, a 120 basis points above the prior year. This reflects the impact of the relatively higher level of R&D investment in the Life Sciences Solutions segment. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q3 was 6.6%. Looking at our results below the line. Net interest expense in Q3 was $106 million, up $49 million from last year driven by the interest on the debt we raised to fund the Life Technologies acquisition. Adjusted other income for Q3 was $2 million, slightly higher than Q3 last year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14.8%, 50 basis points below last year, primarily as a result of our acquisition tax planning. Our year-to-date rate was 15% in line with our full-year outlook of about 15%. In terms of returning capital, we paid out $60 million in dividends to our shareholders in the quarter. Average diluted shares were 403.7 million in Q3, up 36 million or 10% from last year primarily as a result of the shares we issued to partially fund the Life Technologies acquisition, and to a much lesser extent option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations for the first nine months of the year was $1.67 billion and free cash flow was $1.42 billion after deducting $250 million of net capital expenditures. This is up significantly from our prior year cash flow primarily as a result of increased operating earnings from the acquisition and standalone business partially offset by acquisition related interest expense and cash payments tied to the acquisition and related divestitures. We ended the quarter with $544 million in cash and investments, down $62 million sequentially from Q2. We used the Cole-Parmer proceeds and cash generated in the quarter along with surplus cash on the balance sheet to pay down short-term debt during the quarter. As a result, our total debt at the end of Q3 was $14.5 billion, down $1.1 billion from Q2. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.9 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA and we remain on track to achieve our target leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times in Q3, 2015. So let me wrap up my comments on the total company with my usual update on our performance in terms of return on invested capital. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in the third quarter of 2014 was 9.3%, flat to Q2. This is a good result as increased returns across the business offset the short term dilution of adding another quarter of the Life Technologies investment into the average invested capital base. So with that, now I\u2019ll walk you through the performance of our four business segments. Starting with the Life Sciences Solution segment, in Q3 total revenue grew to $1.07 billion from $167 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the Life Technologies acquisition net of the divestitures. On a pro forma basis, assuming Life Technologies was owned for the entire quarter in both periods, organic revenue grew 3% for the second quarter in a row. In the quarter we saw a strong growth in our bio production, next generation sequencing and cell biology businesses and we also saw a good growth in our applied markets, including human identification and animal food and environmental. Q3 adjusted operating income for Life Sciences Solution increased significantly, primarily as a result of the acquisition and achieving the related synergies, with adjusted operating margin up 530 basis points to 28.6%. In the analytical instruments segment both reported and organic revenue grew 3%. In the quarter we had very strong growth in our chromatography and instrument services businesses, which was partially offset by the weakness in China very similar to last quarter. Q3 adjusted operating income in analytical instruments increase 5% and adjusted operating margin was 17.5%, up 40 basis points. We delivered very strong productivity and saw a positive contribution from FX that were partially offset by a strategic growth investments and unfavorable business mix. Turning to the specialty diagnostic segment, in Q3 total revenue grew 7% and organic growth was a very strong again at 6%. We continue to deliver strong growth across much of the portfolio. As Marc mentioned, our immunodiagnostics business had a very strong quarter and growth in our clinical diagnostic business was notable as well. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 10% in Q3 and adjusted operating margin was 27.6%, up 70 basis points from the prior year. In the segment, we had strong pull-through on the organic growth, good productivity and a positive benefit from FX, partially offset by strategic growth investments. In the laboratory products and services segment, Q3 reported revenue grew 2% and organic revenue grew 4%. Our biopharma services business continue to have good performance. The segment also benefited from continued improvement in our US academic and government end market, as well as an increased impact of our customer value proposition in industrial markets. Adjusted operating income in laboratory products and services grew 1% for the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 15.1%, down 30 basis points driven by unfavorable business mix and the Cole Parmer divestiture, partially offset by strong productivity. So with that, I\u2019d like to review the details of our update full-year 2014 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we\u2019re updating our guidance to reflect our strong year-to-date performance and the impact of the recent unfavorable currency fluctuations. Stating with revenue, with one quarter to go we're tightening the range by $40 million and lowering the mid point by $140 million. This changes solely a result of the unfavorable FX impact of current rates on total company revenue for the remainder of the year. This leads to our new full year 2014 revenue guidance of $16.74 billion to $16.82 billion which represents year-over-year growth of 28%. On an organic basis, we\u2019re still expecting standalone organic growth for full-year 2014 of 3% to 4% no change from our previous guidance. As I mentioned earlier, our total company organic growth does not include results of Life Technologies. For the Life Sciences Solutions segment, we still expect pro forma organic growth of 2% to 3% for full-year 2014 also unchanged from our previous guidance. In terms of FX, assuming recent rates, the year-over-year foreign-currency impact on our standalone revenue for the full year has gone from about 50 basis points positive in our previous guidance to about 25 basis points negative in our current guidance. We're experiencing a similar unfavorable impact due to the change in FX rates on our Life Sciences solutions revenue, although this is reflected as acquisition revenues rather than FX in our organic growth calculation. In terms of margin pull-through on total FX revenue, we\u2019re now expecting a minimal positive impact for the full year, down considerably from our previous guidance. Although we've seen a margin benefit from FX year-to-date, we're assuming a fairly significant negative impact in the fourth quarter due to the recent change in rates. Consistent with past practice, we haven't attempted to forecast future foreign currency exchange rates and our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures. Moving to adjusted EPS, as you saw in our press release, we\u2019re maintaining the mid point and tightening the range consistent with revenue range and reflecting our strong financial results year-to-date. This leads to a new full-year 2014 adjusted EPS guidance range of $6.87 to $6.95 which represents growth of 27% to 28% over our 2013 earnings per share of $5.42. As mentioned earlier, although we have significant unfavorable earnings impact from FX compared to our previous guidance, which results in about a $0.07 of adjusted EPS headwind, we're not changing mid point of our adjusted EPS guidance. We expect to offset the FX headwind with a combination of incremental productivity and accelerated acquisition cost synergies, along with about $0.01 of below the line benefit. Turning to adjusted operating margin, we\u2019re expecting roughly 250 basis points of expansion to about 22% at the higher end of our previous guidance. Moving below the line, we\u2019re expecting net interest expense to be in the range of $425 million to $435 million, consistent with our previous guidance. And as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re still expecting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 15% consistent with our previous guidance. In terms of capital deployment, we\u2019re still assuming that we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends. And we're also assuming that we'll continue to use the bulk of our free cash flow to pay down short-term debt. Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 402 million to 403 million, up about 10% from 2013 and consistent with our previous guidance. We\u2019re expecting net capital expenditures to be in the range of $410 million to $430 million, down about $50 million from our previous guidance, based on actively managing our project spend, as well as identifying some duplicate investments as we get further into the integration. Finally, in terms of full-year 2014 free cash flow, we are maintaining our previous guidance of about $2.2 billion. We made good progress on cash flow year-to-date. But as I mentioned on last quarters call, we'll need perform very well in Q4 to offset the cash tax headwind created by the one time gain we realized from the Cole Parmer divestiture. As always, in interpreting our full year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the mid point as our most likely view of how we see the year planning out. Results above or below the mid point will depend on the relative strength of our markets during Q4. So in summary, we delivered a very strong quarter which positions us well to achieve our financial goals for the year. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Ken. Kenneth Apicerno :  Thanks, Pete. Melissa, we\u2019re ready to open it up for Q&A. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ross Muken from ISI Group. Your line is open. Ross Muken - ISI Group :  Good morning, gentlemen. Marc Casper :  Good morning, Ross. Ross Muken - ISI Group : So, lot of color so thank you. But can you give us a little bit of sort of understanding of the trending on a geographic base in sort of the Europe business, as well as sort of Asia-Pac and I guess more specifically China as we kind of pace through the quarter and how it sort of matched up to the degree you can dig down on the bookings line you know, there is obviously lot of macro concern in both of those regions. I was just trying get a feel for which parts of your business are showing sort of strength or more stability, in which parts you're probably much more concerned about in those geographic areas? Marc Casper :  So Ross, thanks for the question. So let's start out with Europe. And you\u2019ve heard us talk many times in the past, we see Europe as a low single digit market from a growth outlook, and we\u2019ve said that consistently. Our team is executing extremely well in Europe. We actually delivered high single digit growth in the quarter. Our diagnostics businesses which have reasonable exposure to the European market, particularly immunodiagnostics and clinical diagnostics have large presence there. They are both doing extremely well. Our biopharma services business did very well in Europe. So the team is executing well and while we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a high single digit growth you know, really on a long-term basis, you know, team is doing great. So that\u2019s positive. Asia Pacific, really the story in Asia Pacific is really around China which is the way you reflected in your question. When I think about what's going on in China, we delivered low single digit growth in the quarter which actually is a little better than what we had in Q2. But it was below the expectations that we had \u2013 as we thought about last quarter. What we saw in China was a slow release of funds across the markets and we think that\u2019s been driven by the government both in how they\u2019ve reorganized the food safety administration, as well as their focus on transparency and you know, cracking down on corruption that the approval times to get fund releases is definitely extended significantly. From a longer term perspective, we continue to remain very positive on China. Our strategy is unchanged, so we have a tremendous advantage of scale, a great team and we're very well aligned with the Chinese priorities, which is you know clean waters, safe food, better environment, expanding healthcare capabilities. So long-term it\u2019s good, but short term has been quite uncertain. So I sum it up in this way, revenue growth has been mid single digits through the first nine months is what is averaged out to be. Bookings has been stronger than that, so customer activity remains high, but funds are slow to release and as we look at the fourth quarter in the uncertain environment what we're assuming is a wider range of outcomes somewhere from low to mid single digit growth in the fourth quarter. Ross Muken - ISI Group :  Thanks. And maybe just talking to kind of the performance overall in the quarter. I mean, I am looking at the market right now, it looks like people are kind of implying that this was sort of a disappointing result, I mean, we took it as more and sort of in line. I mean, as you think about your execution year-to-date how the quarterly EPS is sort of paced and how that\u2019s tracked versus your original expectations, how would you kind of characterize today's result and it seems like the overall 4% organic growth for a choppy macro is a pretty good outcome, I'd be curious how you think about that as well relative to peers? Marc Casper : Yeah. So when I look at where we are at nine months, year-to-date or in Q3 clearly from the beginning of the year, China is slower than I think what anybody would have anticipated if we're sitting here in January. And we are right on track to delver the organic growth outlook that we did. So you know, North America has gotten better and the team has executed very well. So I feel good about that to say we're right in track with 3% to 4% organic growth for the full year. I am also very pleased with the organic growth rates of our Life Sciences Solutions segment which is doing better than it had done for several years in the past, you know, and I don\u2019t get excited about 2% to 3% growth in terms of our outlook. But you know it\u2019s one thing to say it and another thing to actually do it and the team has done a good job of delivering that range of growth. So I feel good about that. Our primary metric is adjusted EPS and we are doing an excellent job of delivering strong earnings growth. That\u2019s a combination of the synergies, the combination of a smooth integration and the power of our PPI business system. And when I look at the outlook, you know when I think about having a $0.07 headwind because of change in FX rates at the end of September an into October and the company's ability to offset that fully at the mid point of our guidance, I think it gives you a sense of the power of the execution model and really it sets us out for a very strong 2015. So that\u2019s the high level; our job is to power through the challenges and what we do is to explain what's going on, but at the end of day we're going to put up good results and we put up good earnings growth in Q3. Ross Muken - ISI Group : Great. Thanks, guys. Marc Casper : Thanks, Ross. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan.: Thanks, guys. Just following up on the guidance, you know, can you maybe talk about whether it\u2019s stronger to offset China being weaker than anticipated for the fourth quarter and other aspects where you're seeing a little bit more incrementally positive [Inaudible] in the year end? Marc Casper : Yeah, if you look at it geographically North America we're expecting to be a bit stronger than when we had given the guidance quarter ago and when you think of it from an end market perspective, industrial and applied and healthcare and diagnostics will be a little bit stronger than what we would have said three months ago. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan.: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then thinking a little bit about the capital deployment priorities and you're heading into next year is you know, you are at a point where you can start to at least think about deploying a little bit more capital. Can you maybe just talk about the M&A pipeline and how you're thinking about opportunities there, should we think about bolt-ons or potentially larger deals? Marc Casper : Tycho, thanks for questions. So first on the capital deployment side of the equation. We paid down over a $1 billion in debt in the quarter. We are on track to hit our target leverage ratio in Q3 of next year. I think based on how well the integration is going and based on us delivering on the cash flows that we expected to delver, we feel confident and comfortable as we move into 2015 to once again start our disciplined, capital deployment strategy. So we don\u2019t feel required to wait until Q3 when we actually achieved the target leverage ratio, but actually you know sometime earlier in the year be able to begin executing it. In terms of the M&A pipeline, there is always a pipeline of activity that we look on and there is always a steady stream of bolt-ons that we would \u2013 wouldn\u2019t have been evaluating. So the team has been active and I would expect over time you'd see us to do some things. The reality is as you know from the many years of covering the company is, we don\u2019t assume any M&A is going to happen. We just assume that we'll have a good pipeline and if we like the fit of a deal and how it helps our customers and if it gives us the returns that we want then we'll go ahead and execute against it. So, not much has changed from that dynamic. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan.: Last one, there was some noise lately around the Kinetica software platform, can you maybe just talk about you know how important that is in the grand scheme of things and next steps and the degree to which you could ultimately be liable if at all for growth if that have been approved? Marc Casper : Yeah, thanks for the question. In terms of Kinetica tiny product line, I had to look it up over the last 10 years in total we sold about $1 million worth of the product, okay, so it\u2019s in the infinitesimal side. We take the issue very seriously obviously and the team is conducting a very thorough internal review. In terms of the potential impact, in the US it seems to be a non-issue as the FDA has stated clearly that it independently analyzes the bio equivalence data in their generic drug approval process. So, that doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue and we're right now going through and confirming what the processes are in Europe in particular to understand that better. So that\u2019s where we are with Kinetica. Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan.: Okay. Thank you. And congrats on the quarter. Marc Casper : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Hi, good morning. Marc Casper : Good morning. Pete Wilver :  Good morning, Derik. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Pete, just though we have little bit of basis then with people you know as we started thinking about 2015. Can you just give us sort of what you think at today's rate the FX hit would be on '15 just to help us little bit better tell where your model? Pete Wilver : So, it\u2019s a little early for us to comment on 2015, but obviously we'll provide a complete guidance as we normally do. In January on Q4 earnings call that said, if today's rates were to hold over the course to next year that would clearly be a revenue and earning side when compared to where we are today. In terms of the magnitude, we'll get into that when we provide detail guidance in January. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. You the lab products and services business is been remarkably strong for the last couple of years and you've been pushing up 4% organic revenue growth its been averaging and lot of that\u2019s been driven by the biopharma services business, and what some broader thought on the LPS business, is it sort of stay at that rate is it normalized more back towards of 8% range going forward. I am just curious in terms of the stability in the business? Pete Wilver : Yeah, so when you look at the lab product and services business, it is the heart of Australian productivity for our customer and which is why the business has continued to and has a you know continue to do well and has a bright outlook effectively the combination of our channel which allows customers to manage the huge complexcity of life science tools is in their research labs the biopharma services business which drives significant productivity in the R&D process in the clinical trials logistic outsourcing and our very large base of equipment and consumables that are used every and everyday in every laboratory help our customers speculate choice on those products, means that what we do here is very relevant. Team has executed very well. We've had you know a good base of customer continuing to take advantage of our capabilities and we've delivered good growth. Whether it will be three or four in any given quarters it\u2019s you know it\u2019s hard to predict. But exactly but I do feel good about the growth prospects of the business Derik. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you so much. I'll get back in the queue. Pete Wilver : Hey, Derik, one other just clarification on your question about FX, so as I mentioned in my comments we have only been reporting the FX revenue and impact related to standalone this year but obviously going into 2015, somewhat what we've been referring to as in a day [Golompus] acquisition, we'll be FX, so you have to take into account the impact of FX on the Life Sciences Solutions revenue as well. So the number will be just as a starting point be bigger in terms of revenue outlined US dollar. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right, I many know life had a lot more, your exposure certainly and your margins that trend, that\u2019s where I was getting, just a little bit of magnitude on hitting back. Pete Wilver : Yeah, as well as yen. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got you. Okay. Thanks. Kenneth Apicerno : We'll make sure we bridge there very carefully when we get into January. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company.: Hey, good morning guys. And thanks for taking the questions. So I guess to somewhat related questions, the first is really life tech synergies, recognizing the update you provided indicates that you guys are tracking are smidge ahead of planned, based on prior Thermo deals and recognizing I think a lot of us thought there were lot of inefficiencies within life check. I think it\u2019s fair to assert that the expectation in the investment community were a little bit higher for upside relative to your synergy targets, you guys seem pretty happy with this. And I guess what I am wondering is that part of this is because you think you are on the cost of an acceleration in the pace of synergies and I make this point largely because as you talked about you maintained EPS guidance for the year in spite of some you know pretty now intense FX headwinds heading into Q4 and without China coming back when you essentially raised underlying EPS guidance for the year by $0.07 even fastening in FX. I mean you guys did acknowledge that you do expect deal synergies to be part of this so I am just wondering if you think you're on the cost but really accelerating the pace of deal synergies associated with the life deal? Marc Casper : So, those are few things, we have been obviously tracking ahead of the synergies both in the first year and in the longer term right. So from the first year we've actually increased three or four times one of the thins that we really don\u2019t like to do is actually is that and it almost sounds cute, that we're raising by x million each quarter, that isn\u2019t the way we like it, first off its simple reason that it affects our colleagues right, and therefore I actually don\u2019t like the dynamic of talking too much about it, but rather you know whether we are on track to achieve our broader goals. I think given the magnitude of the FX headwinds you know we clearly as a team have been driving productivity hard across the entire business, so which every business is focused on and not into Life Science Solutions business as well. So yes we are accelerating the synergies and we're also accelerating cost reduction across the company because that\u2019s the right thing to do in terms of the environment that we're living in. So that\u2019s how we think about it I feel excellent about the 350 and what I can say is that we never stop looking for synergies both on the revenue and cost side and while we don\u2019t use that language inside the company today we're still getting benefits from the combination of Thermo Fisher which happened seven years ago, right. So we don\u2019t call it a synergy but we talked about it as our customer value proposition we talked about it as our strength in emerging markets and we're constantly look for upsides. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company.: Okay. Thanks for that Marc. And Pete I want to take a I guess a more direct shot at following up on Derik FX question, I mean obviously none of us want to predict where rates are going, but if we look at current levels would you disagree that FX looks like about a 2% headwind at the top line and you know I guess that\u2019s first part. The second part would be, should we be thinking as far as through at a similar rate what we've done in the past or is it drastically different because of the life deal as you started to talk about. And then I guess the third part to this would be keeping in mine that you did talk about essentially powering through $0.07 of incremental headwinds in Q4. How should we think about your ability to power through even more intense headwinds of the FX line next year? Thank you. Pete Wilver : So in terms of total revenue, so I you are looking at the $17 billion number its less than 2% its some where in the range of $1.5 but probably be a better number, I don\u2019t have the exact calculation in front of me, in term of pull-through its more then what it was for standalone, Thermo Fisher historically which was generally at the average pull through of the company because as you say when we add life technologies they have much more revenue in foreign currency primarily the euro and yen than they have cost. So we're exposed a little bit more there. In terms of our ability to get the power through and offset the whole thing in 2015 it\u2019s other scale that makes that very difficult. Obviously when we go to our planning process we'll be looking at that and determining what leverage we have to pull in terms of incremental restructuring, accelerating synergies just incremental productivity on all the normal things that we do PPI business system global sourcing the whole mix of what we have to attack those types of things. So as I said before we'll give you full view in January on what our plan is but it\u2019s a big impact to offset completely. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company.: Okay. Thanks, Pete. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : Good morning, guys. Thanks. Pete Wilver : Hi, Isaac. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : Hi, If you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment have interested specifically in your comments around pricing and LPS and analytical technology? Pete Wilver : Yeah, so in terms of pricing environment very similar to what we seen over the last few quarters price is slightly positive in terms of the environment in terms of the \u2013 products and services I would say pretty similar to the average of the company and in terms of analytical instruments generally pricing is been okay, we have such differentiation in most of our product lines and such high level of vitality where we only where price is just function of new products in a way its less so and then in a very competitive segments of in areas like maybe commodity material maybe pricing is a little bit more challenged but again positive pressure overall. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : Great. And then maybe in the OSS segment, could you talk a little bit more about the initiative you have in place to continue accelerate the organic growth profile versus what we saw before the acquisition and then maybe secondly for Pete as you talk little bit about how we should think about incremental margin opportunities across the very segments I would assume its high \u2013 so in a short terms asses given the synergies but just overall longer term period incremental margin by segment would be an interesting sort of general conversation to have? Marc Casper : So in terms of what the team is executing on the growth side of the equation within Life Science Solutions, you know first of all independent the companies were independent and newest opportunities the revenue synergies right, so in the revenue synergies leverage our presence in emerging markets they leverage our corporate accounts and customer value proposition and the strong e-business capabilities for the two companies, right. So there is significant revenue synergies that start to generate next year and accelerate over time so that\u2019s one. Then in the base business excluding kind of revenue synergies within life science solutions you know we are focused on improving the impact of innovation that is clearly a big emphasis of the team. The Attune launch is a good example, we have efforts to accelerate growth in qPCR some interesting things that we're working on in the human identification area and forensic. So there is a number of things in the large installed base of very technically excellent products that we're working on you know really picking up the growth rate and then of course next gen sequencing is part of that as well and getting that business which is actually gone quite well to continue to strengthen its position and drive growth as well. Pete Wilver : And then in terms of margins just at a very high level as you said life sciences solutions is going to benefit from both from synergies but of course they have regular margin expansion and productivity goals like all the other businesses. Analytical instruments we probably be second in terms of year-over-year margin expansion just based on the fact that obviously its all self manufactured products and its lower than the average margin for the company, especially diagnostics and next because this all self manufactured products as well expect for the healthcare channel and margin is relatively high, so its little bit higher to get margin expansion and then in laboratory products and services we have the impact of the channel so it\u2019s a little bit more difficult to expand margins year-over-year there. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs : Got it. Thanks so much guys. Pete Wilver : Yeah. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley :  Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Pete Wilver : Good morning. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley : I'd like to spend just a bit more time on China, maybe a couple there, one Marc when you see the recovery in China, where do you think it shares up what segments of the end market and as you think about how the business there grows in 2015, assuming that budget start flowing again later in the year, could we see a period of accelerated growth with easy comps or do we remain in a some what slower growth environment albeit and potentially better than we've seen in 2014? Marc Casper :  So, in terms of where we have the most exposure to China you would seen in the analytical instrument segment in terms of our presence there so that would be the beneficiary \u2013 the biggest beneficiary. In terms of 2015, obviously the comparison is going to be much easier next year versus the comparison we have next year so that\u2019s a positive factor we're still uncertain to know when the flow of funds is going to pick up so that one I had less visibility to. And so that will be some thing we have to think. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thanks for that. And then one on instruments, the commentary coming out of the ASMS was very positive, the commentary on Vanquish has been optimistic if you look at that business and how its trending if you cold do this excluding the drag from China can you talk about whether you are seeing any organic pick up there as a function of the new products for this year and if not how you think that might emerge going forward? Thanks again. Marc Casper : Yeah. So new products Mass-spec are doing very well so I feel good about that, we had a very strong American Society of Mass Spectrometry show, chromatography business is doing well, I look at the nine moths year-to-date in those businesses I feel good about the performance; in that segment you know we have large industrial exposure with our chemical analysis business particularly around mining and commodity materials which continues to be quite weak so I think that\u2019s somewhat reflected in the number. So if you take the other angle you say, outside of China how is our chrom and mass-spec business is doing, it\u2019s doing quite well. So I feel good about - that\u2019s different ones to think about it, it\u2019s doing quite well. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley : Thanks, Marc. Marc Casper : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research :  Morning, thanks for taking my call. I just wondering if you could provide any thoughts you have regarding the competitive environment now with your acquisition of Life Tech obviously there is been some other large moves recently just wonder if you could provide what are thoughts are on the competitive environment and you know if there any impacts from Sigma-Aldrich being acquired now, on Thermo Fisher? Marc Casper : Yeah, I mean, we've in a consolidating industry we've been driving the consolidation and that trend continues. So that\u2019s something that we've been anticipating for a long period of time, its taken while for the industry consolidate and we expect that will continue to do so. There is still huge avenge of scale and you know there is huge avenge of \u2013 capabilities and we have a big, big hedge stars as the industry leader in terms of executing against it and we keep looking to strengthen our portfolio and do a great job serving our customers and we do that we feel we're very well positioned to grow our market share and strengthen our industry leadership position. So that\u2019s how would see it right now. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research :  Okay. And then just a little bit more of an near term question, a year ago it seems like the fourth quarter for many companies in the industry benefited from a year end budget flush to varying degrees and consequently you have a little bit more difficult comps here in the fourth quarter. Based on my math it looks like your guidance implies roughly kind of 3% to 5%, 5.5% organic growth in the fourth quarter. Just wondering you know what are your thoughts are and how you're going to be able to overcome the more difficult comps here in the fourth quarter versus what you've been experiencing so far this year? Marc Casper : Yeah, so in terms of the guidance for the fourth quarter, if you kind walk you away to the math which I obviously do real quick real time, its about 2% to 4% organic growth in the quarter that\u2019s the range which would then when you kind of do all the math which put you at the 3% to 4% for the company for the full year. So that\u2019s what implied in the guidance. Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research : Okay. Thanks very much. Marc Casper : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Jeff Elliott - Robert W. Baird.: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Marc Casper : Morning. Jeff Elliott - Robert W. Baird.: Pete, first one for you, on FX you mentioned that the $0.07 incremental headwind, is that just on the standalone thermal business does that include the wide portion as well? Pete Wilver :  No, that includes the live portion as well. Jeff Elliott - Robert W. Baird.: Okay. So all in number there. And then Marc just you've given some color on Naspac, I guess can you talk just about the kind of the high end business, not just the new instruments but overall high end Naspac what\u2019s the competitive environment there now? Marc Casper :  To exact to the fusion doing great, strong bookings from revenue, so we feel good about our position in terms of how we're doing at the high end we continue to bring out a stead stream new products and they are very received in the marketplace. Jeff Elliott - Robert W. Baird.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Marc Casper : You're welcome. Pete Wilver : Mellisa we have time for just one more. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Your line is open. Dan Arias - Citigroup: Hi, good morning guys. Thank you. Marc on the academic markets, can you just give a little bit more color on the extent to which the improvement that you know there was a year-over-year fact on easier compare whether you're really seeing some material spending pick up there just once you get a better feel for what the federally funded folks feeling? Marc Casper : Yeah, so academic and government Q3 was incredibly similar to Q2 so the North American environment or the US environment can was positive and the last two quarters was much better than the previous quarters. So you saw as we followed in the year that funding would flow through the systems it is you know it\u2019s robust but it\u2019s clearly its growing which is very good. The offset has been China \u2013 but now that is still low single digit growth I feel good that all for the end markets are back to a positive growth environment. Dan Arias - Citigroup: Okay. Great. And then China, I you could just touch one additional point, last quarter you mentioned that even though the environment was difficult you felt good about not seeing order cancellations its fair to say but that\u2019s still the case this quarter and when the team looks out the next quarter or two that they feel good about what's in the books staying in book? Marc Casper : Yeah, the environment is continuous to be consistent with that and the team is focused on turning those bookings into revenue. Dan Arias - Citigroup: Very good. Thanks. Marc Casper : Thank you. Let me wrap with a few thoughts, the first of which is 2015, we'll get into the guidance process as we normally do in January but let me make a couple of those comments so that because they kind of bit choppy in a way all the questions came out/ the first of which is you know if we were fast forwarding to the FX environment that we are in at this moment time sure that would be a headwind we're going to have some positives which is synergies will continue to ramp up we're going revenue synergies starting to flow and we'll be returning to capital deployment. The way that we will always judge the company is when we're sitting across with any of the member of the investment community are we managing the company extremely well and what ever the environment is and if we can answer that question and the investor would say yes you're managing the company extremely well, then that\u2019s really going to be the output of the financial goals we have for the year. So I feel like we'll get into all the details of it and we'll use the best information we have back in January to articulate that. From the perspective on the quarter that we just finished, you know, we have to be delivered strong quarter it puts us in excellent position to achieve the goals that we had set out for the year and we're excited about doing that and setting ourselves up for strong 2015 an of course thank you for all the support at Thermo Fisher and we look forward to coming back to you at the beginning of the year and reporting on our progress. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

So before we get started, one other item, as I mentioned in prior quarters, please note that the commentary that we provide today regarding the Company's Q4 and full year 2014 total revenue growth and revenue growth by end market and geography are on an organic basis only, and therefore do not include the performance of Life Technologies. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc N. Casper: Ken, thank you. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call today. As you saw in our press release, we finished the year with an outstanding fourth quarter delivering excellent growth on both the top and bottom line. In an environment that still has its challenges, we focused intently on our customers, identified opportunities and executed very well to deliver strong growth. At the same time, we continued to make excellent progress with the integration of Life Technologies and are tracking ahead of our initial goals as we approach the one-year anniversary of the close. Our excellent performance in Q4 topped off what was a great year for us financially, operationally and strategically. This positions the Company well for a strong year ahead and a very bright future over the longer term. We have a lot of ground to cover this morning, so let me get right to our financial performance in the quarter and what we saw in our key end markets. Then I'll cover some of the highlights of the quarter and the year, give you an update on capital deployment and wrap up with our guidance for 2015. So, starting with the quarter, our revenues in Q4 grew 30% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income increased 48%. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 280 basis points to 22.8%. And our strong top line growth and operational discipline led to adjusted EPS of $1.99, which is a 39% increase over Q4 of 2013. Thanks to the determination of our team, we ended the year on a very strong note. Looking at our Q4 performance in the context of our key end markets, I'm pleased to say that we saw strength across the board and we executed well to capitalize on year-end opportunities. First, let me start with industrial and applied. We had another quarter of mid-single digit growth. Our Research and Safety Channel, chromatography and life sciences mass spec businesses performed particularly well. We saw some year-end spending with our industrial and applied customers in Europe and we're able to capitalize on that. In diagnostics and healthcare, we performed well again this quarter with growth remaining in the mid single-digits. We saw a strong demand for our ImmunoDiagnostics products as we had all year. Our transplant diagnostics business and healthcare channel also performed very well in Q4. As you may recall, last quarter we talked about our involvement in supporting customers who are working to contain Ebola. We did see some benefit to our Q4 revenue from this activity. Our customers turned to us for help with some of the most difficult challenges and this was another good example. Turning to pharma and biotech, this end market was particularly strong in Q4 coming in with high single-digit growth. We continued to effectively leverage the strength of our value proposition to help these customers accelerate innovation and drive out cost and we also captured opportunities from some year-end spending. Last, I'm pleased to report that our performance in academic and government was also especially strong in the quarter, growing in the high single digits. More specifically, we saw strong sales of our analytical instruments to several government agencies in the U.S., especially in our life sciences mass spec business. In addition, a number of our businesses took advantage of increased academic and government spending in Europe at the end of the year. So in summary, we performed very well across all of our end markets for a strong finish to 2014. That's a good lead into our discussion of the full year. My assessment of the year was pretty simple. We achieved or exceeded all of our goals, whether you measure us by our financial performance, execution of our growth strategy, our integration milestones or our balance sheet. That's a pretty good report card and let me walk you through each of these achievements in a little more detail. First looking at our financial performance, our revenues grew 29% for the full year. Adjusted operating income grew 45% with adjusted operating margin expanding 240 basis points to nearly 22%. Let me make a quick comment on the topic of margin expansion. We benefited from the acquisition and from delivering the related synergies and we also continued to drive productivity through our PPI Business System, sourcing, low-cost-region manufacturing and footprint optimization efforts. When you add it all up, we achieved significant margin expansion last year and looking ahead we still have a lot of runway. Finally, our strong performance led to a year of outstanding adjusted EPS growth with a 28% increase year-over-year. So overall, we had a great year operationally and we achieved a strong year according to all of our key financial metrics including those related to the Life Technologies acquisition. Now let's talk a little bit about executing our growth strategy and the terrific progress we've made there. As you know, the three elements of our strategy are, developing innovative new products, expanding our presence in emerging markets and leveraging our unique customer value proposition to gain market share. Let me review some of the highlights from the year and a few from the quarter. First, 2014 was another strong year of new product innovation. We have the largest R&D budget by far in our industry and invest about $700 million annually, and that investment is resulting in key new product launches across our technology offerings in Analytical Instruments, Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics. I don't have time to go into every product we talked about during the year but just to do a quick recap, here are some of the standouts. In Analytical Instruments, we strengthened our industry leadership across our Thermo Scientific mass spec and chromatography offerings. We launched the new Q Exactive HF which was the latest generation in our Orbitrap family, and we also launched the Prelude and Endura MD systems for clinical use. It was also a pretty big year for chromatography with the launch of Chromeleon 7.2 software and the Vanquish UHPLC system. In our Life Sciences Solutions business, we strengthened our Ion Torrent next-gen sequencing offering with a number of new product launches. Among the highlights was the Ion PGM Dx instrument for clinical use in the U.S. and Europe. We've also been very focused on delivering NGS based panels for clinical oncology, so cancer treatment can be more effectively targeted to the patient. A good example from 2014 was the Oncomine Solid Tumor DNA kit we launched last year in Europe. In October, we leveraged our capabilities and HLA expertise in our Genetics Sciences and Specialty Diagnostics businesses to launch the research-use-only NXType Kit. This is a workflow for HLA Tissue Typing for transplant patients that we believe will play an important role in further improving Tissue Typing accuracy and transplant success rates. We've heard great customer feedback, so this is a clear example of how our businesses are working together to bring value to our customers. Also in Specialty Diagnostics, we launched the PCT Direct for point of care testing to expand the market for our high-growth biomarker business. So as you can see, 2014 was a very strong year for innovation. We put our R&D dollars and expertise to work to deliver high-impact products for customers working in research, applied markets and the clinic, and we have a great lineup ahead for 2015. Turning to emerging markets, the second element of our growth strategy, the big topic in 2014 was China. We continued to strengthen our industry-leading capabilities in China and delivered mid-single-digit growth in 2014 in a muted government funding environment. While the Chinese government works through the process of implementing reforms, we will keep you posted as to when we see an inflection point indicating faster growth. Thermo Fisher's capabilities are well aligned with key government priorities including food safety, a cleaner environment and expansion of the healthcare system. So we remain very bullish on the long-term prospects for strong growth in China. In the meantime, we haven't been standing still, we've been expanding our presence in other emerging markets like Southeast Asia, India and Brazil to gain additional momentum in these growth regions as well. And we also continue to optimize our footprint in the U.S. and Europe. You may recall that we expanded our Centers of Excellence in Lithuania and Germany earlier in 2014, and in Q4 we had the grand opening for our new Center of Excellence for Specialty Diagnostics in Fremont, California. I was there for the ribbon-cutting and I have to say the facility is quite impressive and a real showcase for production of immunoassays and diagnostic tests. I think our strong performance in 2014 shows that we've done a great job leveraging our global footprint to meet the needs of our customers and capture growth opportunities. The last point I want to make about our growth strategy is that our customer value proposition continues to get stronger as more customers in a range of industries relies on us to help them meet their growth objectives. We've been leveraging our value proposition in BioPharma with great success as you know and we also had some nice wins with industrial customers who are seeing the benefit of our depth of capabilities. One of the biggest highlights here in 2014 was the addition of Life Technologies. It further strengthened our ability to help our customers drive innovation and productivity and really positions us well to continue to gain share with our biotech, pharma and industrial customers. That's a good segue to the integration, clearly a major achievement for us in 2014. Our over-riding goal with the acquisition of Life Technologies is to combine our capabilities in a way that serves our customers best to drive growth, and we're off to a great start. As you know, in this phase of the integration, we've been focused on delivering the cost synergies, planning the revenue synergies and making sure that we set the business up for accelerated growth. In terms of the cost synergies, we achieved $150 million in cost synergies last year. As we've mentioned previously, that was faster than we originally outlined and we're well on track to deliver the $300 million of cost synergies in year three. Turning to the revenue synergies, we've been developing detailed plans since the close to realize the benefits of our combined capabilities. We're now implementing those plans and are starting to deliver revenue synergies this year. We're very confident in achieving our goal of $150 million of revenue synergies in year three which is 2016. Our team has done a lot of work here and it's exciting to see the plans start to materialize. For example in early January this year, we introduced about 14,000 SKUs from the former Life Technologies organization into our research channel in North America. Our sales reps are being trained to represent the expanded portfolio and the team is excited about the opportunities. Although it's early days, our customers have been responding very favorably. The final word I want to leave you with on the integration is that the Life Sciences Solutions business grew about 1% faster in 2014 than it had in the past three years. This is another indicator that the integration is off to a great start. Onto the last major achievement of the year, in terms of our balance sheet, 2014 was all about repaying debt. We generated strong cash flow and paid down $3.8 billion of debt in 2014 related to the acquisition of Life Technologies. That got us to a leverage ratio of about 3.6x by year-end. Given the pace of delevering and the confidence in our cash flows, we started deploying capital immediately in 2015. In fact, we bought back $500 million of our stock in the first few weeks of the year. We have many opportunities ahead to create shareholder value t6hr our proven strategy of effectively deploying capital. Let me now turn to our guidance for 2015. Pete will cover the details now on all of the assumptions for our revenue and earnings guidance, but I'd like to make a couple of comments. Our 2015 guidance reflects a number of factors. First, it takes into account our very strong underlying operating performance. It also includes the revenue synergies we expect to achieve as well as the continuation in the ramp-up of cost synergies. It factors in contributions below line from share repurchases we just completed and tax planning initiatives we are implementing. And as you are well aware, we're also operating in a very challenging FX environment. So when you sum it all up, we're initiating revenue guidance in the range of $16.80 billion to $17.0 billion in 2015, which is about flat with the last year and includes a 4.5% headwind from foreign currency. On the bottom line, our adjusted EPS assumes an 8 percentage point headwind from currency. So we're guiding to adjusted EPS of $7.22 to $7.40. This would result in 4% to 6% growth over our strong EPS performance in 2014. Before I turn the call over to Pete, let me leave you with a few takeaways. First, our team worked with amazing intensity on all fronts throughout 2014. Their efforts led to a very strong year and that puts us in an excellent position going into 2015. Second, in terms of our guidance for 2015, the unfavorable FX is masking our strong underlying operating performance in the short-term. We'll see how rates play out as the year unfolds and update our guidance accordingly. If rates deteriorate further, we'll determine how much we can offset. If they improve, we'll add the benefit to our revenue and earnings. So in summary, we will continue to execute well, deliver growth and set Thermo Fisher up for a very successful future. With that, I'll now like to turn the call over to Pete Wilver, our CFO. Pete? Peter M. Wilver: Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll begin with an overview of our Q4 and full-year 2014 financial performance for the total Company, then provide some color on our four segments and conclude with a detailed review of our 2015 guidance. As a reminder, at the total Company level, we're reporting organic revenue growth using our standard methodology. That means we'll exclude the results of Life Technologies until we reach the one year anniversary date of the acquisition in early February this year. However for the Life Sciences Solutions segment, we're providing organic revenue growth on a pro forma basis, as if we had owned Life Technologies for all of 2013 and 2014, to give you some insight into the growth performance of that segment. So starting with our overall financial performance in the fourth quarter, we grew adjusted EPS by 39% to $1.99. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $6.96, up 28% from 2013. GAAP EPS was $1.49 in Q4, up 62% from $0.92 in the prior year's quarter, and $4.71 for the full year 2014, up 35% from 2013. As you saw in our press release this morning, starting with the top line, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth this quarter and our reported revenue increased 30% year-over-year. Q4 reported revenue includes 26% growth from acquisitions net of divestitures and a 3% headwind from foreign exchange. Please note that the components of the Q4 change in revenue did not sum due to rounding. For the full year, total revenue increased 29% year-over-year and organic revenue was 4%, slightly above the high-end of our most recent guidance as a result of our very strong results in Q4. Full-year reported revenue includes 25% growth from acquisitions net of divestitures and a slightly negative impact from FX. We strengthened our backlog in the quarter with bookings 2% higher than revenue. Looking at growth by geography, in the quarter North America grew in the high single digits and Europe grew in the mid-single digits. Asia Pacific grew low single digits with China growing mid-single digits. Rest of the world grew in the low single digits. For the full year, North America and Europe grew in the mid-single digits, Asia-Pacific and China grew at the same rates as Q4, and rest of world was essentially flat. Looking at our operational performance, Q4 adjusted operating income increased 48% and adjusted operating margin was 22.8%, up 280 basis points from Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 45% and adjusted operating margin was 21.9%, up 240 basis points from 2013. Our adjusted operating margin expansion for the quarter and the full year benefited from the Life Technologies acquisition and achieving the related synergies. That said, we also continued to see strong contribution from our primary productivity levers, global sourcing, footprint optimization and our PPI Business System. We realized $13 million of benefit from our restructuring actions in Q4 and $49 million for the full year, and we realized $42 million of synergy benefits in Q4 and $115 million for the full year. We took advantage of our strong performance in Q4 to make additional strategic investments, primarily to strengthen our core technology platforms and commercial capabilities and accelerate growth. Moving onto the details of the P&L, total Company adjusted gross margin came in at 49% in Q4, up 470 basis points from the prior year. This was primarily due to the addition of Life Technologies along with solid productivity across our businesses. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 48.8%, up 460 basis points from 2013. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 22.1% of revenue, which is 80 basis points unfavorable to 2013. Again, this was primarily a result of the acquisition and was partially offset by volume leverage and our cost synergy and productivity actions. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 22.9%, 130 basis points unfavorable to 2013. Finally, R&D expense came in at 4.1% of revenue for both the quarter and full year, 110 basis points above last year. This increase reflects the impact of the relatively higher level of R&D investment in the Life Sciences Solutions segment. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue for full year 2014 was 6.4%. Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense in Q4 was $107 million, up $45 million from last year. The increase was driven by interest on the debt we raised on fund the Life Technologies acquisition as well as the debt issuance we completed this past November to refinance maturities through the first half of 2015. Net interest expense for the full year was $432 million, an increase of $198 million from 2013. Adjusted other income for Q4 was $9 million, $10 million higher than Q4 2013, and for the full year it was $13 million, $9 million higher than last year, both driven primarily by non-operating foreign exchange gains. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.2%, 270 basis points below last year, primarily as a result of acquisition tax planning and the U.S. R&D tax credit which was approved in Q4. Given late approval of the R&D credit, we recognized the entire full-year benefit in the fourth quarter. Our year-to-date rate was 14.5%, lower than our full-year guidance of 15%, as a result of the R&D tax credit. In terms of returning capital, we continued to pay our dividend and paid out $60 million in the quarter and $235 million for the year. Average diluted shares were 404.1 million in Q4, up 33 million or 9% from last year, primarily as a result of the shares we issued to partially fund the Life Technologies acquisition and to a much lesser extent option dilution. For the full year, average diluted shares were 402.3 million, up 36 million from 2013. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations for the year was $2.62 billion and free cash flow was $2.25 billion, after deducting $378 million of net capital expenditures. This is $50 million above our full-year guidance as a result of very strong cash flow performance in Q4. It's also up significantly from our prior year cash flow, primarily as a result of increased operating earnings from the acquisition as well as the standalone business. This increase was partially offset by acquisition related interest expense and cash payments tied to the acquisition and related divestitures. We ended the quarter with $1.35 billion in cash and investments, up $800 million sequentially from Q3. This increase was driven by free cash flow in the quarter and the November debt issuance I mentioned earlier, partially offset by incremental paydown of our term loan. Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $14.6 billion, up $100 million from Q3 and our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.6x total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. As Marc mentioned, we spent $500 million in the first few weeks of January on share buybacks, and given our 2015 financial guidance and that we've resumed capital deployment early in the year, we now expect to achieve our target leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x by the end of 2015. So let me wrap-up my comments on the total Company with my usual update on our performance in terms of return on invested capital. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in Q4 2014 was 9.5%, up 20 basis points from Q3. This shows that we're delivering increased returns across the business which are offsetting the short term dilution of adding another quarter of the Life Technologies investment into the average invested capital base. So with that, now I'll walk you through the performance of our four business segments. Starting with the Life Sciences Solutions segment, in Q4 total revenue grew to $1.19 billion from $192 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the Life Technologies acquisition net of the divestitures. On a pro forma basis, assuming Life Technologies was owned in both periods, organic revenue grew 7%. In the quarter we saw a strong growth in our bio production, qPCR, cell biology and next-generation sequencing businesses. Overall, we benefited from year-end spending by our pharma and biotech customers as well as government customers in the U.S. and Europe. For the year, reported revenue grew to $4.2 billion, with pro forma organic growth of slightly above 3.5%, driven by strong performance in the fourth quarter. Q4 adjusted operating income for Life Sciences Solutions increased significantly, primarily as a result of the acquisition and achieving the related synergies, with adjusted operating margin up 660 basis points to 30.8%. For all of 2014, adjusted operating margin was 29%, 520 basis points higher than the prior year. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue grew 2% in Q4 and organic revenue grew 5%. We had strong growth in our life sciences mass spec, chromatography and services businesses in the quarter. For the year, reported revenue growth was 3% and organic growth was 4%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments stayed flat to the prior year and adjusted operating margin was 20.2%, down 30 basis points. In this segment, we delivered very strong productivity that was more than offset by strategic growth investments along with unfavorable foreign exchange and business mix. For all of 2014, adjusted operating income increased 4% and adjusted operating margin was 17.9%, 20 basis points higher than 2013. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment, in Q4 total revenue grew 4% and organic growth was very strong again at 7%. We continued to deliver strong growth across much of the portfolio. As Marc mentioned, our ImmunoDiagnostics business had a very strong quarter and growth in our Transplant Diagnostics and biomarkers business were robust as well. Our healthcare channel also had a strong finish to the year, in part driven by sales of seasonal products. For the full year, both reported and organic revenue grew 5%. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 6% in Q4 and adjusted operating margin was 27.1%, up 70 basis points from the prior year. In the segment, we had strong pull-through on the organic growth, strong productivity and a positive benefit from FX, partially offset by strategic growth investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 6% and adjusted operating margin was 27.4%, up 30 basis points from 2013. In the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q4 reported revenue grew 2% and organic revenue grew 8%. Our Research and Safety Channel showed particular strength benefiting from continued improvement in U.S. academic and government markets and year-end spending by our BioPharma and industrial customers. For the full year, reported revenue grew 3% and organic revenue grew 5%. Adjusted operating income in Laboratory Products and Services was flat for the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 14.5%, down 40 basis points driven by unfavorable business mix and the Cole-Parmer divestiture, partially offset by solid productivity and favorable price. For the full year 2014, adjusted operating income increased 2% and adjusted operating margin was 14.9%, down 10 basis points from the prior year. So with that, I'd like to review the details of our 2015 guidance. As Marc mentioned, we're initiating a 2015 adjusted EPS guidance range of $7.22 to $7.40, which represents growth of 4% to 6% over our 2014 EPS of $6.96. In terms of revenue, our guidance range is $16.80 billion to $17.00 billion, which is about flat with our reported revenue of $16.89 billion in 2014. As Marc mentioned, we're seeing an unprecedented negative impact on both the top and bottom line as a result of the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus our major foreign currencies. As always, we're focused on our reported numbers, but I thought I'd give you a bit more color on FX to give you some perspective on how it's impacting our guidance. Foreign currency is reducing our adjusted EPS growth by $0.58 or 8%. So if you were to look at our 2015 guidance on an FX neutral basis, adjusted EPS would be growing 12% to 14%, which represents very strong underlying operating performance. On the top line, FX is lowering our revenue by about 4.5%, so our FX neutral reported growth guidance would be 4% to 5%. Moving on to the details of our guidance, acquisitions net of divestitures are expected to contribute about 50 basis points to our reported revenue growth in 2015. On an organic basis, our revenue range assumes an organic growth midpoint of about 4%, which includes Life Technologies after February 3, the one year anniversary of the close date. The midpoint of our 2015 organic revenue growth guidance is essentially the same as our 2014 organic growth when calculated on a pro forma basis including Life Technologies. We're not expecting any significant changes in our growth assumptions by end market compared to 2014. And that being said, there is a slight mix shift by end market as a result of including Life Sciences Solutions in our 2015 organic growth calculation from February onward. As a result, we're expecting slightly slower growth in pharma and biotech in the mid to high single digits and slightly stronger growth in academic and government although still in the low single digits. We expect growth in diagnostics and healthcare as well as industrial and applied to be consistent with 2014 at around the Company average. For the Life Sciences Solutions segment, we expect pro forma organic growth of 3% to 4% for 2015. Compared to 2014, growth in this segment will benefit from revenue synergies but will face a more difficult growth comparison and some dilution from the divestitures. Consistent with past practice, our guidance assumes current foreign currency exchange rates and we haven't attempted to forecast future changes in rates. Our guidance also does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures. Turning to adjusted operating margin, we're expecting around 50 to 70 basis points of expansion year-over-year. In terms of pull-through on the FX revenue headwind, we're expecting a substantial unfavorable impact on the bottom line totaling $275 million or about 37% average margin and 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin dilution. This is being driven primarily by the weakening of the euro and Japanese yen. With the addition of Life Technologies, the euro now pulls through to our adjusted operating income at a little more than 35% and the yen is consistent with prior years at 60% pull-through. So if you were to look at our 2015 guidance on an FX neutral basis, our margin expansion would be very strong at 120 to 140 basis points. We're aggressively managing our cost base and driving top line actions to offset as much of the FX headwind as possible without damaging our future growth prospects. We're also managing the FX impact with below the line actions such as share buybacks, further optimizing our debt structure and initiating additional tax planning strategies. In total, we expect our productivity drivers to yield about 260 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. Similar to last year, we expect to deliver productivity from our PPI Business System, our global sourcing initiatives including low-cost region sourcing and manufacturing, our footprint optimization actions and we're assuming about $115 million of incremental cost synergy benefit in 2015, and that will realize about $60 million of revenue synergies with around $20 million of adjusted operating income benefit. This puts us well on track to achieve our year three goal of $350 million of combined cost and revenue synergies. These benefits will be somewhat offset by select strategic investments to continue to drive growth primarily in emerging markets and also to enhance our customer experience. Moving below line, we expect net interest expense to be in the range of $375 million to $385 million, about $50 million lower than 2014. The decrease is primarily as a result of continuing to pay down our term loan along with settling our 2015 maturities, a portion of which will be financed with our November 2014 bond issuance. We're expecting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14%, down slightly from 14.5% in 2014. In this projection, we're assuming that the R&D tax credit will be approved again in 2015 or that we'll do some incremental tax planning above our base assumptions to replace it. In terms of capital deployment, we're assuming that we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends and $500 million through share buybacks which as I mentioned we completed earlier this month. This leaves about $400 million remaining on our current share buyback authorization. Full-year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 403 million to 404 million, up slightly from 2014, and we're expecting net capital expenditures to be in the range of $435 million to $450 million. Finally, in terms of full year 2015 free cash flow, we're expecting about $2.6 billion, up $350 million compared to 2014. As a final note on guidance, I thought it'd be helpful to give you some insight into what we're expecting for Q1 2015, because Q1 last year included only a partial quarter of the Life Technologies acquisition and that resulted in higher than normal margin due to the timing of revenue and expenses throughout the quarter. We're expecting Q1 2015 reported revenue growth of 1% to 3%, and organic revenue growth of 2% to 4%. In terms of Q1 earnings, we're expecting adjusted EPS growth of 2% to 6% and adjusted operating margin expansion of about 15 basis points. In addition, we expect our interest expense and tax rate to be higher in Q1 than the average for the year as a result of the phasing of paying down debt and implementing tax planning throughout the year. As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see things playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets as well as FX fluctuations during the year. In summary, we delivered a strong finish to the year which positions us well to achieve our financial goals for 2015. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth J. Apicerno: Thanks, Pete. Melissa, we're ready to open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] In order to allow everyone in the queue an opportunity to address the Thermo Fisher management staff, I would like to ask that you limit your time on the call to one or two questions. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue and pose your question in turn. Your first question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin : Wow, first question for a change. So just one quick one and then just one other one, so Pete, you're a day less in Q1 this year by your calendar, is that my correct calculation on that? Peter M. Wilver: Yes, it's one less day in Q1 and then we pick up the day again in Q4. Derik de Bruin : Okay, just making sure that that's there. And I guess on China, can you just sort of \u2013 I mean a couple of your competitors made some noise about seeing at least a little bit of improvement or seeing some potential pickup, I mean what's embedded into your organic revenue growth guidance for China this year? Marc N. Casper: In terms of China, looking back at last year, mid-single digit growth in the quarter, mid-single digit growth for the full-year, bookings growth was stronger at high single-digit, so we built a little bit of backlog. From our perspective, we're assuming in the guidance that market conditions are going to be very similar in 2015 to 2014, and obviously when we hit an inflection point for accelerated growth and we'll obviously communicate it, but there's not a huge amount of transparency right now into when the government is going to step up spending. So based on the fact that 2015 has an easier comparison versus what we've had last year, that should hopefully be a conservative assumption on China. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Ross Muken : On the quarter, in and of itself, I mean you had, and a couple of other businesses had their best sprint of the year from a growth perspective, if you sort of look under the hood and examine where the greatest deltas were in the Q at least relative to your expectations, ex maybe one-off things like flu, where do you feel like the core performance really inflected and it was sort of a market or share or kind of underlying dynamic, because I think the numbers across the board in some of the pieces were a lot there than certainly we were looking for? Marc N. Casper: So, Ross, the team across our businesses and across the globe performed very well, and the 6% organic growth, the strength in each of our business segments really was a highlight. Very nice to see the Life Sciences Solutions business had very strong growth in the quarter, delivered a very nice year overall with about 3.5% growth on the full-year which is about 1 point better than what it had been growing the prior year. So that's a real positive. But we saw good performance in our channel businesses, both in Specialty Diagnostics and in the Research and Safety one within Lab Products and Services, and generally a great year with our mass spec and chroma business as well, so really strong across the board. Ross Muken : And obviously relative to 2015, very difficult environment, you sort of noted sort of unprecedented from an FX perspective, so as you sort of saw rates shift in the last several weeks, what are the sorts of discussions you have internally in terms of whether it's prudent to do something more aggressive on the cost side or push up synergy capture, I mean it's obviously a hard thing to judge and the magnitude of the moves have been kind of again more volatile than we would have thought, so as you think about sort of the potential offsets or how you plan out the rest of the year because you've never been shy doing things into a year, what are the key things we should look for to figure out if maybe we see further offsetting items that come later in Q2 or Q3 or beyond? Marc N. Casper: So that's a great question. So the way the team has thought about it is the following, which is Company is performing extraordinarily well operationally, good momentum with our customers, and when we looked at the FX headwind, the way the team has responded, is signed up for a more aggressive operating plan, right. So you look at it, the midpoint of our guidance at organic growth of 4% is stronger than the last few years. When you look at the underlying margin assumptions, EPS assumptions, with only $0.5 billion of capital deployment, you're seeing very strong fundamental actions. Some businesses took incremental cost actions, some businesses signed up for more growth, and basically we have a great team of people around the world, we discuss it business by business and so what's the best way to maximize our performance. So that's to look at how we're dealing with the situation right now at this moment in time. Looking forward, if rates improve, we're just going to let that flow to the bottom line and just raise the guidance. If rates deteriorate, then what the team is going to do is try to offset as much as we can without damaging obviously the Company for the long-term. So it's not a plus or minus, we're only \u2013 it moves evenly if the world gets more difficult, we'll offset what we can do, and if the world gets better that all goes to the bottom line. So that's how we're thinking about it. Ross Muken : I guess you probably never imagined a year where you'd have as strong a core growth as you're having, it would only drop down to 5% earnings growth. Marc N. Casper: The way I look at it is, we have managed through lots of different environments and we exit every one of these periods a stronger, more competitive industry leader, and I view the FX changes as an opportunity for Thermo Fisher to plough through this and come out as an incredibly strong company with great financial performance, and we'll look back at this period, whether it's one month, six months or a couple of years in terms of this type of environment, and I think our shareholders and certainly our customers will say, wow, Thermo Fisher distinguished itself once again. So that's how we're thinking about it, we'll be super-aggressive in managing the business. Ross Muken : Alright, thanks Marc. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Isaac Ro : So just want to ask a quick question on the LPS business, just trying to get a sense of the extent to which you felt like market share or mix might have been part of the strong performance? Marc N. Casper: So in the LPS segment, we have more exposure to the academic and government customer base there and that obviously had strong year-end spend both in Europe and the U.S., so that helped us from an end market perspective. And our Research Channel business, Research and Safety Channel business is doing great, it's performing well and I think it continues to gain market share. So it's a combination of those two events. Isaac Ro : Got it. And then, in the forensics business, that's obviously been a really nice business for you guys over the years, both prior to the Life acquisition and since. Looking ahead, it seems like there's a little new competition coming on the marketplace. What's your plan to sort of defend your turf there and maybe try and expand the market to a sustained, a healthy growth rate? Marc N. Casper: In terms of forensics, we're the industry leader globally, we have a great position between our Sanger sequencing and some customers are starting to look at NGS and we play a role there as well. So we're leveraging our installed base and decades long relationships with these customers to make sure that they're getting what they need. It's a conservative customer base and we're well-positioned there. We work with a variety of governmental agencies as well to help them expand the market and create new opportunities for forensics testing, we're right in the midst of that, and that rewards us with good market share. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : Nice quarter. Maybe just kind of going back to the prior questions on some of the offsets for FX, and maybe for Pete, I'm wondering if you could talk about whether any of the tax strategies that you alluded to could have an impact this year. And then on the repo, I assume you'll complete the remaining 400 million. That sounds like that wasn't embedded in guidance, but beyond that, should we assume that buybacks are a bit more of a priority than bolt-on or larger M&A in this environment? Marc N. Casper: Let me do the capital deployment one and then Pete will cover the other part. In terms of capital deployment, our assumption in the guidance is to have $1 billion. That we completed. In terms of the balance of how we think about the year, we'll continue to look at bolt-on M&A and where it makes sense we have a good pipeline, so we'll look at that. And then obviously as the year unfolds, we'll determine whether it makes sense to do additional share buybacks or not. So right now, what's embedded in the guidance is what we've done and then we'll update you in the future quarters about how we're going to deploy capital. Peter M. Wilver: Then on the tax rate, so Tycho, we've baked in a significant amount of tax planning actions into our guidance, and as I said we've included the R&D tax credit, so that's worth about $20 million. It hasn't been approved yet but it's been approved the last number of years. So we decided to put it into our guidance this time around. So if that doesn't happen for some reason, then we would actually have to come up with $20 million of incremental tax planning in order to offset it, which we feel confident that we can do, but that's the way it's set up in our guidance. Tycho Peterson : Then in terms of some of the assumptions by segment or customer base embedded in guidance, you talked about mid-single-digit to high single digit growth in pharma biotech. Can you maybe just talk about the momentum there, is this largely from some of the larger global accounts? And then on academic, low single digit seems like a reasonable starting point. I think there are some discussions and do you see you could see a more meaningful bump than has been proposed to the NIH, so any intel you can share from what you're hearing out of DC on the budget? Marc N. Casper: So in pharma and biotech, obviously had a very strong year in 2014, high single digit growth in the quarter and the year. As we look to this coming year, there were some mid to high single digits simply because we have the Life Technologies included in the end market calculation. So that just makes it a bit of a broader base but we focus on gaining share. Academic and government, right now the funding level in the NIH is modest growth. There's a lot of dialog going on about increased opportunities but that hasn't yet obviously translated. Obviously there was a little bit of a mention in the State of the Union and Dr. Collins, the Head of the NIH, has been out actively talking to the industry and the constituents about opportunities to make investments there. So we'll see how that plays out, if it gets even stronger than what we anticipated at this point. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then just lastly, if we think about the strong dollar, any chance you would maybe accelerate some international investments? I know you're moving some manufacturing to Singapore. Are there other opportunities to maybe benefit from the strong dollar in terms of your manufacturing footprint? Marc N. Casper: It's a good question. So in terms of manufacturing, one of the things that we're doing, we're moving more of our production of reagents to our Lithuanian site which is both low-cost and obviously we'll benefit from the exchange rates. Over time, we'll increase sort of the natural hedge in our business by increasing our manufacturing footprint in Europe by selecting our lowest cost facility to do that. So we've got a very substantial presence in Lithuania and continue to expand that out. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Doug Schenkel : My first question is on M&A. So the Life deal was completed about a year ago, you're in a position to get the debt-to-EBITDA ratio down to 2.5x this year, could you just give us a refresher on your M&A criteria including size parameters, maximum leverage parameters and ROIC targets and over what period? And related to this, is it fair to conclude that while it would be tough to do anything in Life Sciences Solutions given ongoing Life Tech integration efforts, that sizeable deals that have overlap with other business units are fair game if they make sense? Marc N. Casper: Great question. So given that we haven't done, after doing very large transactions we had a quieter year, it's a good opportunity to refresh everyone on our M&A approach, right, and it's obviously been fine-tuned over 15 years and we have a great track record here. The strategy is around, acquisitions have to strengthen the Company strategically. It has to be well understood and appreciated by our customers and it clearly has to create shareholder value as measured by return on invested capital. Our hurdle rate has remained the same over very long periods of time which is an 8.5% cost of capital is what we assume, it is the hurdle rate, meaning that we're targeting double-digit returns or better when we deploy capital internally or externally. In terms of areas of focus for M&A, it would cut across our higher tech portions of our portfolio, Life Sciences Solutions, Specialty Diagnostics, Analytical Instruments. And in terms of the scale of deals, we don't have any size constraints, although the way I think about it is, over the last 10, 15 years, we've done two large deals and we've done, I don't know, 75 to 100 bolt-ons, right. So the predominance of what we do is bolt-ons and in any given year you should expect us to look at some smaller transactions, and then once every few years when the stars line up sometimes larger things happen. In terms of the target leverage ratios, we like to operate day to day in the 2.5x to 3x. We're willing to spike up to about 4.5x. So we have plenty of capacity at any point in time if we want to deploy capital on something that clearly creates shareholder value, and occasionally those larger opportunities present themselves, but I think you should expect us to be doing bolt-on acquisitions as based on where the number of companies really are in terms of opportunities. Doug Schenkel : And the last part of the question on a bit by segment, is it right to assume that LSS is probably not ready for something big but other areas might be if the opportunity presents itself? Marc N. Casper: I mean generally the LSS \u2013 I mean not generally, specifically, the LSS team is doing an incredible job of managing the business, the team is nailing it. Is it likely that we'll have very large transaction there? No, I think it's a little likely here event, but I'm very confident in the team, but I would say we're really focused on running what we have, and where things to create shareholder value and strengthen the Company, we'll look at them. Doug Schenkel : Okay. And then I guess my second question is really on the pharmaceutical end market. It clearly sounds like momentum has continued there for not just you but others in the group. For Thermo specifically, you guys have been pretty strong in this end market for a while and that's a function of not just recent cross-group trends but also new products and really your ability to package products across different verticals. Could you talk about two things, one is, how you're feeling about your ability to continue to pick up share the way you have over the last few years via your portfolio approach, and I guess the second part of it is, how should we think about visibility on sustainability? Q4 for example was really, really strong. Is there any risk of that there is some pull-forward of spend that might lead to a moderation in growth at least in the first half of the year and how do you factor that into guidance? Thank you. Marc N. Casper: So in terms of the continuation of the ability to gain share, the leverage of our value proposition, highly, highly confident, we have gotten only better, right. We have more experience, more case studies, more customers willing to do referrals and even more capabilities with the addition of Life Technologies to our portfolio. So we're doing well and we have lots of opportunity to continue to drive that, we're expanding the number of accounts we're focused on and generally I feel great about it. In terms of visibility, I have pretty good visibility into the end market. I mean it bounces around a little bit quarter to quarter. In terms of \u2013 the easiest way to answer is more how to think about the year, alright, if we're saying \u2013 we are saying, the 4% organic growth is the midpoint of the guidance for the full-year for the Company, we have a little lower organic growth in Q1, as Pete mentioned in his opening comments, and we expect the second half of the year to be slightly stronger than the first half of the year on an organic basis. So that is a comment on all the end markets as opposed to a comment specifically on pharma, Doug. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steve Beuchaw : Marc, I wanted to follow-up on a comment you made in your prepared remarks about academic spending trends. It's clearly embedded in the overall outlook and you've referenced a couple of points where academic was particularly solid at the end of the year. I wonder if you could point us to where over the course of 2015 you think there's the most opportunity for improvement, not so much in terms of execution but in terms of the end market specifically in academic and government. Marc N. Casper: So, Steve, as we look at 2015, we're expecting low single digits but a little bit better than the low single digits we delivered in 2014. We're expecting the U.S. to be slightly stronger because the customer base has more visibility to the budgets now and that allows them to spend. So that should play out exactly as we thought on the academic and government, which was weaker spending in the first half of the year, stronger spending in the second. We expect this year the environment to be stable and modest growth, so U.S. a little better. We think Europe will be a little bit more muted just given the economic environment there, but still a little better in aggregate across the globe. Steve Beuchaw : And then a broader question on seasonality in the model, I mean when we look at 2013 and again in 2014, in both years we were surprised a bit to the upside on organic growth, and we can point to different factors in each year, but I wonder is it possible that we're getting into a world where the business is a little bit more seasonal where the fourth quarter does trend a little bit stronger than it might have on a relative basis as compared to prior years and we should think about that in terms of how we model the second half of 2015? Marc N. Casper: In terms of overall activity, the fourth quarter is by far the strongest because you've had some factors change over the last few years. One is the way healthcare utilization patterns have operated with low activity in the beginning of the year and then it ramps. So in terms of absolute dollars, Q4 is very strong. In terms of the organic growth, it shouldn't affect things, right. Organic growth in that respect shouldn't be affected by that change. What is happened, at least as we look back at the last couple of years in the fourth quarter is, the economic environment has been pretty stable and customers have been willing to release year-end funds. In both years, it was always at the beginning of those years some uncertainty, could the world be bad, and at the end of the year the world played out okay and people released money. So I think there's a bit of a people holding back until the end of the year, a little bit of caution, and then if things look okay then they release funds. So I think that's going on a little bit. Steve Beuchaw : Thanks so much. Marc N. Casper: Melissa, we have time for just one more. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Steve Willoughby : Really just two things. First I guess, Pete, as it relates to your guidance for 2015 looking at operating margins, I know you broke out the negative impact from FX. Could you maybe also help us think about the 50 to 70 basis points you guys are guiding to operating margin expansion in 2015, what is the makeup of that expansion, is there any incremental benefit from Life, gross margins versus leveraging other expenses? Peter M. Wilver: Sure. So just in terms of the split between the elements of the P&L, if you take the midpoint, of 60 basis points about 30 comes from gross margin and about 30 comes from SG&A, and we expect to hold the R&D percent of revenue pretty much flat year-over-year. And then in terms of how it breaks out between the different elements, FX and price/volume mix, so price/volume mix is about 50 basis points. As I mentioned earlier, foreign exchange is a 70 basis point dilution. There's about 10 basis points net between the acquisition and divestiture. So that represents the divestitures related to the acquisition as well as the Cole-Parmer divestiture, and then just picking up one month of Life Technologies that we didn't get last year. Productivity, about 190 basis points; synergy, 70 basis points; inflation, negative 90; and then about 100 basis points of investments. That's a pretty similar profile to what we've seen in prior years with the exception of obviously the foreign exchange dilution is very significant. So other than that, it's pretty much a normal year. Steve Willoughby : Okay, thanks so much for that. And then just secondly, in terms of the revenue synergies Marc alluded to, you guys are starting to do some of that in 2015. I might have missed it, but did you give a number of what you're factoring in for revenue synergies in 2015 in your guidance? Peter M. Wilver: Yes, I did. It's 60 million in revenue and we're assuming about 20 million EBITDA pull-through on that. Marc N. Casper: Great. So let me thank everyone. We're going to wrap-up the call. Obviously we're pleased to deliver an outstanding quarter, a great year in 2014. We're looking forward to build on that momentum, have a really strong 2015, and of course thanks for the support to Thermo Fisher Scientific and we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thanks everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investor section of our website, thermofisher.com under the heading Webcast and Presentations until May 15, 2015. A copy of the press release of our 2015 first quarter earnings and future expectations is available on the Investor section of our website under the heading Financial Results. So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 under the caption Risk Factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and also available in the Investor section of our website under the heading SEC Filings.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our first quarter 2015 earnings and future expectations, and also in the Investor section of our website under the heading Financial Information. Also before we get started, one other item to note is that the commentary that we're going to provide on the company's total organic revenue growth, as well as revenue growth by end market and by geography, now includes the performance of Life Technologies as of February 4, 2015, the one-year anniversary date of the acquisition. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our Q1 call. To summarize our performance this quarter, we delivered solid earnings growth. We launched a number of exciting new products, further strengthened our presence in emerging markets, and began to realize revenue synergies from combining our new capabilities. All of this creates even more value for our customers. At the same time, we took new cost actions to offset the additional FX headwinds that have occurred since our previous guidance. Based on these accomplishments, we remain well-positioned to deliver on our growth goals for the year. As usual, I'll begin with a financial summary and give you some color on our performance by end market, then I'll cover some of the business highlights from the quarter, provide an update on our synergies and then capital deployment, and wrap up with our current guidance outlook. So starting with the financials, our revenue in Q1 grew slightly to $3.92 billion. Our adjusted operating income increased 3% to $857 million. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points to 21.9%, and we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.63, which is a 7% increase over Q1 last year. Our solid adjusted earnings per share growth is a result of the productivity that we always generate through our PPI Business System, and our ability to fully leverage our top line growth to drive bottom line performance. Looking at our growth performance by end market, although the environment in Europe had an overall dampening effect, what we saw in Q1 was generally in line with our expectations. The one exception was academic and government, which came in softer than we expected. So let me start there, with the academic and government end market, which declined in the low-single-digits during the quarter. This was driven primarily by Japan's well-publicized government budget delays, as well as a tough Q1 comp because of the consumption tax dynamic a year ago, which we had anticipated. We expect that the academic and government end market will be stronger in the balance of the year. Turning to industrial and applied, we grew here in the low-single-digits. Our businesses serving commodity materials markets continued to be soft, while those serving applied markets did very well, similar to what we've seen in this end market for a while. In particular, our chromatography business had another strong quarter. In diagnostics and healthcare, we grew in the low-single-digits during the quarter. We had good growth in our clinical diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses, as well as our healthcare market channel. Last, in pharma and biotech, our performance here continues to be very solid, with strong mid-single-digit growth. Our BioProduction business delivered a particularly strong quarter. I've invested quite a bit of time in the past few months meeting with our pharma and biotech customers to get their feedback and better understand how we can partner in driving their innovation and productivity. Our value proposition is a key differentiator, and we continue to gain momentum here. Let me now highlight some of our accomplishments from the quarter, which will show the great progress we've made to set ourselves up for a successful year. As you know, our key growth drivers are : developing innovative new products, expanding our presence in emerging markets, and leveraging our unique customer value proposition to gain share. So in terms of innovation, we have a lot to talk about here, but I'll focus on just a few of the new product launches from Q1. First, at Pittcon, we've been focused on our customers in applied markets and using our analytical instrument leadership to develop new Thermo Scientific products that are both powerful and easy to use. One of the most novel new products we introduced was our Gemini chemical analyzer. It combines FTIR and Raman technologies in a handheld unit that can identify unknown chemicals and explosives in the field. We have essentially redefined handheld instrumentation with a two-in-one analyzer that can be used by the military to protect troops, or by first responders to keep the public safe. We also continued to expand our industry-leading Orbitrap Mass Spec franchise by launching the Q Exactive LC-MS. This is a more powerful alternative to Q-TOF analysis for customers working in forensic toxicology, pharma QA/QC, or food and environmental testing. The advantage of the Q Exactive Focus is its ability to perform high-resolution, accurate mass analysis at a much lower price point than our other Orbitrap-based systems or competing Q-TOF technologies. Another highlight worth noting was that our customers who read SelectScience magazine voted Thermo Fisher, their Company of the Year, based on peer reviews and ratings. This award recognizes the strong customer allegiance we built through our leadership in analytical instruments. Separate from Pittcon, we launched a new personal monitor to protect miners from exposure to coal dust, which can cause black lung disease. The new generation PDM3700 delivers improved performance over our original unit, which was developed through a unique collaboration with government agencies, labor representatives and the mining industry. In laboratory equipment, we introduced a new ultra-low temperature freezer called the TSX, which is an advancement in both efficiency and sustainability. It runs on a natural refrigerant that uses 50% less energy than a conventional freezer and has less impact on the environment. The TSX is a great example of our commitment to helping our customers protect the integrity of their samples, while achieving their sustainability goals. The last product that I'll highlight is from our next-generation sequencing line and represents our latest development for advancing clinical research in oncology. Based on our Ion Torrent AmpliSeq technology, the RNA Fusion Lung Cancer Panel is a new tool for detecting gene mutations in very small tissue samples. This panel was confirmed by a consortium of leading clinical researchers from around the world, who are considered pioneers in colon and lung cancer research. I think these examples clearly demonstrate our commitment to innovation and to fulfilling our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. Turning now to emerging markets. As highlighted in our press release, we made great progress here as well and we had good growth in China, South Korea and India during the quarter. We're pleased to report that China grew in the high-single-digits in Q1, strength in biopharma and healthcare led to a strong demand for our laboratory equipment, consumables and bioscience reagents. We also benefited from good growth in air and water quality monitoring. While this is not yet indicative of a trend, it's certainly going in the right direction. I traveled to China in late March to visit with our key customers and get a first-hand understanding of the local dynamics from our leadership team there. I came away very optimistic about our long-term prospects. We're seeing strong growth in products we make in China, which means our low-cost region manufacturing strategy is paying off. We also expect to launch several exciting new products this year that have been developed in our China Technology Center. As China prepares to announce its next five-year plan in early 2016, we're confident that Thermo Fisher will be in an excellent position to capture those opportunities and gain share. In other emerging markets, we also noted in our press release that we acquired two of our channel partners, one covering South Korea, the other covering Singapore and Malaysia. These channels increase our direct access to analytical instrument customers in Asia. We're also expanding our commercial presence in Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia with the opening of new sales offices, demonstrating our commitment to serving our customers across Southeast Asia. After acquiring the Singapore channel partner, we quickly integrated their operations in demo labs into our Marsiling facility there, which we built into a new Center of Excellence as part of the integration of our Life Science Solutions business. This is another example of the synergies we're creating as a result of the acquisition of Life Technologies with the goal of combining our capabilities in a way that strengthens our customer value proposition. Last quarter I mentioned that we began selling thousands of Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems branded products through our Fisher Scientific channel within our Lab Products and Services segment. I'm pleased to report that we're already seeing some incremental growth as a result of that. Just to give you a quick update on the acquisition synergies, we're off to a great start here as well. We began to see some of the revenue synergies kick in during Q1 and we're confident that we'll deliver the $60 million of revenue synergies we committed to this year. In terms of the cost synergies, for the full year, we now do expect to deliver $125 million of cost synergies, up from our previous guidance of $150 million this year. Pete will provide a bit more detail in his remarks. Before I turn to our guidance, I'll make a quick comment on capital deployment. As you know, we started to deploy capital immediately in 2015 buying $500 million of our stock in the first few weeks of the year. We have many opportunities ahead to create shareholder value by effectively deploying capital through a combination of stock buybacks, dividends and strategic M&A. On the topic of M&A, we spent $300 million in Q1 to acquire a nice bolt-on to our BioProduction capabilities, Advanced Scientific Inc., or ASI, which had $80 million of revenue in 2014 and offers customized single use systems and bioprocess equipment. These products complement our existing single use technologies. They strengthen our ability to help our life sciences and healthcare customers quickly develop high-quality low-cost solutions for their production of biologics. Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2015. As you saw in our press release, we're updating our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance to reflect the impact of more unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates as well as stronger operating performance and the acquisition of ASI. We now expect revenue for the full year to be in the range of $16.67 billion to $16.83 billion. We're also raising the low-end of our adjusted EPS range by $0.03 to a new range of $7.25 to $7.40, which would result in 4% to 6% growth over 2014. Given the additional $0.09 of FX headwind in our guidance, I think it shows that we're managing in this environment very effectively. In addition to the productivity we always drive through our PPI Business System, last quarter we said, we'd take further actions if FX rates deteriorated. This was the case, so in Q1, we began implementing targeted price increases, putting more focus on gaining concessions from our supplier base and controlling costs more tightly. Before I turn the call over to Pete, let me summarize my remarks by saying we performed well financially. We had another quarter of solid adjusted EPS growth. We continued to invest in a bright future by successfully executing our growth strategy, and last, the integration continues to go very well and we're on track to deliver our revenue and cost synergy targets. All of this positions us to achieve another strong year. With that, I'll now hand the call over to Pete. Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll begin with an overview of our Q1 financial performance for the total company then provide some color on our four segments and conclude with our updated 2015 guidance. As a reminder, at the total company level, we're reporting organic revenue growth using our standard methodology. That means that we've excluded the results of Life Technologies up to the one-year anniversary date of the acquisition, which was in early February. However, for the Life Sciences Solutions segment, we're continuing to provide organic revenue growth on a pro forma basis as if we had owned Life Technologies for all of 2014 and 2015 to give you more relevant insight into the growth performance of that segment. So starting with our overall financial performance, in the first quarter, we grew adjusted EPS by 7% to $1.63, which represents very strong underlying operating performance given a 10% headwind from FX. GAAP EPS was $0.96 in Q1, down 29% from $1.36 in the prior-year's quarter primarily as a result of the gain on divestitures in the prior year. On the top line, organic revenue growth was 2% this quarter and our reported revenue was flat year-over-year. Q1 reported revenue included 5% growth from acquisitions net of divestitures and a 6% headwind from foreign exchange. Please note that the components of the Q1 change in revenue did not sum due to rounding. We strengthened our backlog in the quarter with bookings more than 1% higher than revenue. Looking at our growth by geography, North America grew in the low-single-digits and Europe declined in the low-single-digits. Asia Pacific grew in the mid-single-digits with China growing high-single-digits. Also of note, Japan declined in the mid-single-digits as a result of government funding delays and a very strong growth in the prior year, as Marc mentioned. Rest of world grew in the low-single-digits. Looking at our operational performance, Q1 adjusted operating income increased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 21.9%, up 60 basis points from Q1 last year despite a 60-basis-point headwind from FX. At a high level, our adjusted operating margin expansion for the quarter was driven by continued strong contribution from our primary productivity levers, global sourcing, footprint optimization and our PPI Business System as well as strong year-over-year contribution from cost synergies. Net acquisitions and divestitures were actually about 25 basis points dilutive in the quarter primarily as a result of picking up January results for Life Technologies, which were at a much lower margin than the company average for the quarter as expected. We realized $14 million of benefit from our restructuring actions in Q1 and we also realized incremental synergies of $48 million. From a quarterly phasing perspective, in 2015, Q1 benefits the most from year-over-year synergies because we had no synergies in January of last year compared to having a full-year 2014 run rate of synergies in January of this year. For the full year, we now expect cost synergies of $125 million, up $10 million from our previous guidance of $115 million primarily as a result of accelerating realization of head count and sourcing synergies. Revenue synergies during the quarter were $5 million with $2 million of adjusted operating income pull-through. We expect revenue synergies to accelerate through the year, so we're still on track to achieve our full-year 2015 guidance of $60 million in revenue synergies and $20 million of adjusted operating income pull-through. In Q1, we continued to make additional strategic investments primarily to strengthen our core technology platforms and commercial capabilities and accelerate growth. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 49.3% in Q1, up 110 basis points from the prior year. The increase was driven by the addition of Life Technologies as well as solid productivity across our businesses. Adjusted SG&A in Q1 was 23.2% of revenue, which is 10 basis points unfavorable to Q1 2014. The increase was primarily a result of the addition of Life Technologies, partially offset by volume leverage and our cost synergy and productivity actions. Finally, R&D expense came in at 4.2% of revenue, 40 basis points above the same quarter last year. This increase reflects the impact of that relatively higher level of R&D investment in the Life Sciences Solutions segment. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q1 was about 6.5%. Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense in Q1 was $101 million, down $4 million from last year, primarily as a result of paying down our debt balance versus the prior year. We also restructured some of our debt during the quarter to lower our interest cost, which was included in the previous guidance. Adjusted other income for Q1 was $7 million, which was $5 million higher than Q1 2014, driven primarily by non-operating foreign exchange gains. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14%, 200 basis points below last year, primarily as a result of acquisition tax planning. We spent $500 million in January to buy back 3.9 million of our shares and we returned an additional $61 million of capital through dividends in the quarter. Average diluted shares were 401.4 million in Q1, up 3 million or 1% from last year, primarily as a result of the shares we issued to partially fund the Life Technologies acquisition, along with some option dilution, partially offset by the share buybacks. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations in Q1 was $82 million and free cash flow was negative $15 million, after deducting net capital expenditures of $97 million. This compares to $1 million of free cash flow in Q1 2014. Compared to the prior year, we picked up about $300 million of non-repeating \u2013 from not repeating the acquisition-related payments that you may recall we made last year, which was offset by the timing of interest and tax payments, as well as normalization of Life Technologies into our Q1 results. We ended the quarter with $870 million in cash and investments, down $480 million sequentially from Q4 2014. The decrease was driven by our capital deployment on share buybacks, the ASI acquisition, and dividends. Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $14.9 billion, up $300 million from Q4 2014, and our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.6 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA. We continue to expect to achieve our target leverage ratio of 2.5 times to 3 times by the end of 2015. So let me wrap up my comments on the total company with my usual update on our performance in terms of return on invested capital. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in Q1 2015 was 8.9%, down 60 basis points from Q4 2014. This is in line with our expectations and as a result of adding another full quarter of Life Technologies investment into our five-quarter average invested capital, while only adding an incremental month of Life Technologies earnings. The acquisition impact is now fully in our invested capital base and we expect ROIC to increase steadily for the remainder of the year. So with that, now I'll walk you through the performance of our four business segments. As I highlighted for the total company, FX was a significant headwind to the top line for our segments and negatively impacted their year-over-year revenue growth to varying degrees. We also had one less day in the quarter, which mainly affected our consumables-oriented businesses. Starting with the Life Sciences Solutions segment, in Q1, total revenue grew to $1.02 billion from $840 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the Life Technologies acquisition, net of the related divestitures. On a pro forma basis, assuming Life Technologies was owned in both periods, organic revenue grew 2%. In the quarter, we saw strong growth in our BioProduction business, partially offset by some weakness in academic, government, and applied markets. Q1 adjusted operating income for Life Sciences Solutions increased significantly, primarily as a result of the acquisition, and adjusted operating margin was 29.3%, flat with the prior year, consistent with our expectations. In the segment, we had very strong productivity, including acquisition synergies, and good pull-through on incremental organic revenue. This was offset by unfavorable FX and dilution from the incremental acquisition revenue which, as I mentioned earlier, represented January results and pull-through a much lower-than-average margin for the segment. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue decreased 6% in Q1, and organic revenue grew 1%. In the quarter, we had strong growth in our chromatography business, which was partially offset by weakness in academic and government and some of our core industrial markets. Q1 adjusted operating income in the Analytical Instruments decreased 7% and adjusted operating margin was 16.7%, down 30 basis points. In the segment, we delivered very strong productivity that was more than offset by strategic growth investments and some unfavorable business mix. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment in Q1, total revenue decreased 4% and organic growth was 3%. As Marc mentioned, our clinical diagnostics, immunodiagnostics, and healthcare channel businesses had good growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating income in the segment decreased 3% in Q1, and adjusted operating margin was 27.3%, up 10 basis points from the prior year. In the segment, we had strong productivity and good pull-through on organic growth, partially offset by strategic growth investments and FX. Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q1 reported revenue declined 5%, driven by FX and the Cole-Parmer divestiture. On an organic basis, revenue grew 3%. Our research and safety channel showed particular strength, benefiting from good growth with biopharma customers. Adjusted operating income in Laboratory Products and Services decreased 5%, and adjusted operating margin was 14.7%, flat with the prior year. This was driven by strong productivity offset by unfavorable business mix, the Cole-Parmer divestiture, and FX. So with that, I'd like to review the details of our full-year 2015 guidance. In terms of adjusted EPS, with a solid quarter behind us, we're raising the low-end of our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.03 to a new range of $7.25 to $7.40, which represents growth of 4% to 6% versus 2014. To bridge the $0.015 increase to the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance, we're seeing an incremental $0.09 headwind from FX, which we're more than offsetting with $0.035 below the line from other income and a slightly lower share count, $0.02 from the ASI acquisition, and $0.05 of operational improvements, including incremental cost synergies. On the top line, as a result of the deteriorating FX environment, we're lowering both the high and low end of our reported revenue range, partially offset by the addition of the ASI acquisition. This leads to a new full-year 2015 revenue guidance range of $16.67 billion to $16.83 billion, which is down slightly compared to our reported revenue of $16.89 billion in 2014. To bridge the $150 million decline from the midpoint of our previous guidance, we're expecting an additional $240 million headwind from more unfavorable foreign exchange rates, offset by about $90 million of incremental revenue from acquisitions. To summarize the impact of FX on our current guidance, on the top line, FX is now lowering our revenue by about $985 million, or 6%, so our reported growth guidance would be 5% to 6% on a FX-neutral basis. In terms of adjusted EPS, FX is now $0.67 headwind or 10% year-over-year. So if you were to look at our guidance on an FX neutral basis, adjusted EPS would be growing 14% to 16%, which represents even stronger underlying operating performance than our previous guidance. Moving on to the details of our guidance, acquisitions net of divestitures are expected to contribute about 1% to our reported revenue growth in 2015. On an organic basis, there's no change to our organic growth guidance midpoint of about 4%. And consistent with past practice, our guidance assumes current foreign currency exchange rates and we haven't attempted to forecast future changes in rates. Our guidance also does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures. Turning to adjusted operating margin, we're expecting 60 basis points to 80 basis points of expansion year-over-year. This is up 10 basis points from both the low and high end of our previous guidance primarily as a result of stronger operating performance. In terms of the adjusted operating margin pull-through on the incremental FX revenue headwind, we're seeing an additional $40 million of unfavorable impact on the bottom line, bringing the total impact to $315 million or 65 basis points of adjusted operating margin dilution. So on an FX neutral basis, our margin expansion would be very strong at 130 basis points to 150 basis points. Moving below the line, we're still expecting net interest expense to be in the range of $375 million to $385 million although the ASI acquisition pushed us slightly higher into the range. We're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14% consistent with our previous guidance. In terms of capital deployment, we're still assuming that this year we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends as well as $500 million through share buybacks, which we completed in January. Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 402 million to 403 million, about the same as 2014 and down about 1 million shares from our previous guidance. We're expecting net capital expenditures to be in the range of $435 million to $450 million, which is unchanged from our previous guidance and for full-year 2015 free cash flow, we're still expecting about $2.6 billion consistent with prior guidance. As always in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see things playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets as well as FX fluctuations during the year. In summary, we had a number of significant achievements this quarter while delivering solid operational results, which positions us well to achieve our financial goals for the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Pete. Melissa, we're ready to open it up for Q&A. Operator : Your first question is from the line of Jon Groberg from UBS. Your line is open. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning and congratulations on another solid quarter. So, Marc, would you mind just, I guess, obviously, one of the big questions is going to be on the low-single-digit 2% organic revenue growth. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about your conviction that that growth rate improves a little throughout the year? You mentioned you thought academic and government would get a little bit better. And can you also maybe talk about some of your more specific plans to offset FX? I know you mentioned some on the cost side, but is there anything you're doing in terms of pricing? And how are you finding the pricing environment? Thanks. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jon, thanks for the questions. So, yeah, let's start kind of with the holistic view, right, for organic growth. The key takeaways we feel very comfortable with the 4% organic growth guidance for the full year that we set off back in the beginning of February and we feel good about that today. When you think about the quarter, if you recall back to early February, we said that this would be in the range of 2% to 4% organic growth and primarily so lower in the first quarter and builds as the year goes on, primarily because of the calendar day difference, right, so we anticipated that. When we look at the performance of the quarter, really the only big change was Japan didn't approve its budget during the quarter that got approved, I think, on April 9. So that's back in place. Europe was a little weaker, but China was a little bit stronger. So there were puts and takes. But I felt like the quarter played out within the range of what we expected. Looking forward, so why do we have real good confidence in the 4% organic growth? Straightforward, bookings were very good in the quarter, so that was favorable to revenue. We saw a lot of activity and a lot of interest very late in the quarter as well. So the funnels look good. When I look at the products that we've launched and the product pipeline that we have coming up for the balance of the year, it looks outstanding. So we have a lot of growth driven from that. The early funnels on revenue synergies built nicely in the quarter and that puts us in a position to drive revenue synergies. So when I look at the full year, we're in a good spot to deliver the 4% organic growth. In terms of foreign exchange, one of the key messages on the last call, Jon, was what would happen if foreign exchange rates change back as of February 1. And we said that if rates got better, we would let that flow to the bottom line. If rates got worse, we would try to take actions to offset as much as we possibly could. Rates clearly got worse in the quarter, as Pete highlighted in his remarks. Just focusing on the EPS side of the equation, there was a $0.09 incremental headwind. And our teams really were very focused on putting additional actions that give us confidence that we can offset those headwinds and deliver an even better outlook on EPS for the year. Part of that is some very targeted price increases in those markets where foreign exchange has been a factor and where there's not a lot of domestic competition, domestic meaning local competition in those markets. So Japan would be an example that we have some very targeted price increases. And while it's early to know exactly how it's all working out, pricing was relatively good in the first quarter. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks a million. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : So I'd like to stick on Jon's theme on the core. So you mentioned that booking's pacing towards the end of the quarter kind of gave you some confidence that the ability to hit the 4% target was still on track. And so as you look at that, I don't know what's the right way to cut it, Marc, by geography or by end market? Where did you see the biggest inflection over the course of the quarter? Because as we look at some of the PMIs and we look at some of the other industry commentary, it's a little bit different than sort of what you saw in the business and so we're just trying to mix-and-match. And by that I mean Europe seems a little bit better and maybe China, the service seems a little bit worse. And so we're trying to make sense of what you saw bookings versus what the market overall macro is seeing. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Ross, Europe improved clearly as the quarter went on. Very, very slow start at the beginning of the year and improved. So that was a positive. China, as I mentioned, I was in China in March. Generally, the team from the beginning of the quarter right to where it finished felt that they were going to deliver high-single-digit growth and they did, right. So we didn't see much of, I'd say, change in activity level, meaning, it was a better quarter, but the team saw it and it was consistent throughout. And so China was a little bit better, it's a little early to call a trend there, but we didn't see China deteriorate at the end of the quarter or anything like that based on the data you're referring to. So those are the two factors. Europe got better and China was good. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Got it. And maybe big picture. You talked about sort of M&A. So I was listening to my company's conference call before I jumped on this one and Roger Altman talked about sort of the trend in the market right now as maybe deal volumes are lower, but dollar volumes are higher. So we're seeing a lot more larger transactions. As you think about this space, it's actually been the opposite. I mean, other than Sigma, we really haven't seen much activity. I mean, in general, are you kind of surprised about what you're seeing in the pipeline? You're able to get there on the ASI, which looks like a really good deal. But as you think about where your leverage is going, you obviously have some firepower there. How are you thinking about the trade-off of what may be available versus where valuations are versus sort of what other opportunities you have? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So great question. In terms of the capital deployment side of the equation, we have an active pipeline of transactions. We always do and we do currently. So we're looking at things. And as you know, we like to look at everything. But at the same point, we are very selective in what we actually do. And as long as something solidly meets our criteria of strengthening the company strategically, clearly, being understood and adding value for our customers and creating shareholder value, then we'll pursue those things. So I like what the funnel looks like, but you got to drive things through the funnel. ASI was a nice acquisition. We did two tiny little things in the channel to strengthen our commercial capabilities, and we're looking at a number of other things. So in terms of your bigger question about sort of the space, the bigger transactions, they happen, but they don't happen very frequently. And when they do, we usually will take a look, but they don't occur with a lot of frequency. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Great. Thanks, Marc. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Morning, Derik. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So just to clarify your China comment, you said you're seeing some improvement. Is that still mostly lower-end lower-priced products, i.e., chromatography as opposed to pushing the higher-end mass spec? Just a little bit more color just sort of given some of the anti-corruption activities and stuff that were going on in the past? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, Derik, if you look at China and you saw a clear increase in, what I'd say, your run rate activity, your bioscience reagents, your lab equipment, your lab consumables, those types of businesses, were very improved, meaning, that customers have money, they're spending it, activity is good. The bigger ticket items clearly continue to be muted. And that affected clearly our Analytical Instruments business. Chrome was quite strong, but things like mass spec were clearly affected by a tighter budget and more scrutiny, if you will, by the government. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. That's very helpful. And just one follow-up. On Specialty Diagnostics, we were expecting a little bit higher number there. We're expecting a little bit more tailwind from flu and some other things. Could you talk about what you sort of saw in the diagnostics space globally? And just sort of the push and pulls in that business? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think when you look at the result in diagnostics, the one day difference probably is your biggest factor from... Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: ...what you would think from the other things. So I actually look at the underlying fundamentals or how the business performed, it's actually pretty solid; so not much there. We got a tiny benefit from seasonal, pollen season in Japan was slightly worse, so the net of seasonal was just slightly better in aggregate. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks very much. I'll get back in the queue. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. Just want to follow up on some of the questions around guidance. And just so we're clear on what you're embedding now for Japan, now that we're through the March fiscal year, are you assuming a recovery here in the second quarter? And maybe just, you could quantify your overall expectations for the year in Japan? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So what we're expecting in Japan is that you'll see growth return back to a more normalized level. And typically, we assume kind of low-single-digit growth in Japan is kind of the baseline assumption. We've actually had performance better than that in the past, but that's the baseline assumption. So, just given the timing of where the budget was, we would expect growth to start to normalize back to the traditional growth rates. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then, following up on a question on China a minute ago, I think you're still cautious about calling any sort of inflection, but obviously high-single-digit growth this quarter. Can you maybe just give us a sense of what could get you closer to high-single-digit growth versus mid-single-digit growth guidance for the year in China? Are there specific catalysts we should be paying attention to, or is it just... Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I mean, the team is clearly working towards that objective, right. So all of our colleagues, 4,000 colleagues, that's what they're driving towards. But they don't control sort of the government environment, right. So there's \u2013 the reason we just didn't put a hard-line type commitment to it is that, it is variable what the environment is. But clearly after a few very challenging quarters, we saw some nice bright spots. And if we can line up two or three quarters like that in a row, then that clearly would be a trend. So that's what the team is focused on. It's just executing well. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then just lastly on BioProduction, you called it out as an area of strength. You obviously did the ASI bolt-on. Maybe just talk a little bit about what you're expecting for that business this year, and your visibility around that business? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So BioProduction, market-leading position in media and sera through our Gibco range of products, in a very strong position, and single-use technologies through the Thermo Scientific and ASI set of products. That will be a very fast-growing business for us. It is a double-digit type growth business for Thermo Fisher. INTERPHEX is going on right now. I know the early feedback is very positive on our range of capabilities, in terms of what we show to our customer base there. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome, Tycho. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Steve. Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: First off, Pete, I just want to say thanks for all your help over the last year. Thank you so much. And we'll miss you on the calls. Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then for Marc, I guess I'll ask a question on China. Sorry for asking the fourth or fifth of these. But taking a longer-term view, Marc, you made some interesting comments about the longer-term outlook in China, specifically how you are thinking about the impact of the new five-year plan and your positioning for relative share there, given your positioning there as a local manufacturer. Be really interesting just to hear you expound upon those comments, to think about maybe the 24-month view for the market there? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Steve, a couple of things. One is, we've been in China for 30-plus years. And one of the things that helps the company get successful is anticipating the changes in the environment to continue to be out in front of them so that you can benefit from the evolution of the economy. Our assumption is, and this is not a bold statement, is that GDP growth will be more moderate in China than what it had been in the previous five years. And because of that, there's going to be a more emphasis on jobs in China and therefore, we've made a big commitment to manufacturing in China, having a very strong R&D presence, having great talent out of the best universities so that when we're meeting with the government and talking about initiatives for growth, they're seeing the brightest Chinese people that work for Thermo Fisher actually saying why we want to push forward these environmental applications, these food safety regulations, these sequencing applications, and that puts us in a great position to compete. And as we look to the development of the next five-year plan, we feel like we'll be incredibly well positioned to capitalize on that. Our goal is always to have very strong growth in China. We've invested a lot there. And the exact details of it we always give each year in our guidance, but it should be a double-digit type growth market for us for a long period of time. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Much appreciated. And then, I'm not sure if this is for Marc or for Pete, but just in the interest of completeness, given all the questions out there in the industrial channel, I'd say I take your comments about the cadence of growth through the quarter, with it being strong in March, is to suggest there's no knock-on impact, or sign of any knock-on impact, from what we've seen in oil and gas CapEx. Is that a fair assessment, or is there more nuance to it? Thanks. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So what I would say is that clearly, the oil and gas end markets are soft. But they're very, very, very small for us, right. So there's some effect, but it doesn't hit any level of materiality to the company. So that's how I think about that. And you can just kind of lump it into the commodities material markets are soft, and oil and gas is soft, but there is nothing much to spend \u2013 dwell in there. And generally, industrial and applied should be a reasonable market for us this year. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks so much, guys. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Your line is open. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you. Just wanted to see if I could understand the comments on academic and government. Marc, does the softness that you saw there pertain mostly to Japan, or is that something that showed up in the U.S. and Europe, too? Just a little bit clarification there if you could. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So Japan was the primary driver, right. So we had been growing in the low-single-digits last year. We declined in the low-single-digits. The full delta between sort of flat and the decline was driven by Japan, maybe the difference between flat and the rest was just a little bit of softness that we saw in Europe. So that would be the academic and government story, really is a Japan story. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. And then just maybe going back to capital deployment and following up on Ross' M&A question, I guess, in general, when you think about the candidates or the targets that are in your pipeline and sort of the mid to smaller size of things, I mean, are the majority of them on the private side? Are you actually finding a handful of public assets that are interesting, too? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I mean, this industry is mostly private companies, right, in terms of the number of companies, right. So there's a huge pipeline of those. We continue to look at those closely and every once in a while you'll see us be able to get one over the goal line. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks very much. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Doug. Doug, you're on mute? Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: I'm on mute. Sorry about that. Talking to myself again. All right. So thanks for taking the questions, guys. So my first question and this has been asked, I guess, in different forms. But just to be pretty direct about this, you guys came in at the low-end of your organic revenue growth guidance for the first quarter. This came after Q4 growth that was much stronger than most of us expected. In hindsight, was there some pull-forward of revenue into Q4 at the expense of Q1? And if so, in what geographies and end markets was this most notable and was this not apparent to you until the very back end of the quarter? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Doug, interestingly enough, if you think about what happened a year ago and what happened this year, you have similar patterns. Very, very strong finish to the year and then a softer Q1. And Pete when he laid out the guidance said, Q1 will be a little bit softer than the balance of the year. And what I would say the dynamic is, if you think about what happened in both of those years, nothing really bad happened in the world. And one of those calls, you heard me say this, right. Customers keep a certain level of money on the side to manage for a disaster, right. In both 2013 and 2014, the way the world ended, things were okay. So people release funds very late in the year. That dynamic does the following, which is if you want to buy something exciting and expensive you buy it, but sometimes if you have a little extra money, you wind up buying something you absolutely know you're going to need, right. And so I'm sure that some high-tech consumables, bioscience reagents, if people had a little bit of money they bought a little bit knowing that they'd use in the first quarter. Does that have a tiny bit of an effect? Sure. But is it something worth calling out? No, is the way I would think about it. Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And this is very short-term focused, but recognizing it is a quarterly call, I think it's important to ask the question. I'm a bit surprised that you guys have called out Japan academic government as a source of weakness relative to what you expected in the quarter. A lot of what you described seems like it should have been embedded in your expectations. Just to be clear, I mean, was Japan really worse than what you had embedded into expectations? And if not, where else was academic government weak? I mean, you point a slight weakness in Europe beyond your expectations, but it doesn't sound like there's anything real notable there. I just want to make sure there's nothing that would suggest there's particular areas where maybe you were a bit weaker than expected from a competitive standpoint. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, Doug, I guess, a couple ways I would think about that. One is, Japan not a huge market for us, right, in aggregate, top five, top six market, but not a huge market, accounted for the whole academic and government about a little more than a 3% decline for the company, right, in the quarter. So it gives you a sense of how soft it was. There were two factors, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, one which we clearly understood and embedded in our guidance, which was a very challenging comparison in Japan because of the consumption tax last year, which had customers pull things forward. Not having the budget pass until after the quarter end, I don't think it was \u2013 from everything I've read from the team that we've worked with for many, many years, was not something that they anticipated nor, as far as I can tell, was really expected. So that's the difference in the performance, right. So I don't know maybe other people saw that happening and we missed it, but from my understanding, I think we planned it appropriately and that's the way it played out. Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Last one real quick. The LSS pro forma growth, I believe, was 7% in Q4 that moderated to, I think, 2% this quarter. I think you had previously provided Life Tech guidance for this year that was above your long-term goal. Does that remain unchanged after Q1? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So basically, the segment played out pretty much the same story as the company, right, 2% growth in the quarter versus 3% to 4% for the segment for the full year. We feel good about the 3% to 4% for the segment for the full year. I'll spend some time talking about that at the Analyst Meeting coming up, which I believe is May 20. So mark the date. And Ken's happy, he's smiling that I'm doing a plug for that. But, yeah, nothing has changed in terms of our outlook for Life Sciences Solutions segment. Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. Thanks. Just a couple cleanups for me. Could you maybe, Pete, give us a sense of the impact to gross margin in terms of the FX headwind, just how much of a headwind that was? Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So in terms of gross margin, it's about 45 basis points year-over-year, negative. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Right, right. Okay. Thanks. And then just another question on BioProduction, if we just kind of look at the competitive landscape, it seems like three out of the four players there or major players all seem like they had pretty good quarters like really strong actually. So I'm wondering if there's a sense at the market there is inflecting and if so, why? Obviously, there's been a lot of momentum in biotech with new biologics and funding, but just curious about what's actually going on in the underlying level, because it seems like everyone there is growing strong double-digits. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think you have the combination of drug approvals, biosimilars and vaccines. That combination of those three are really driving substantial growth in that market. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And is it fair to say that will kind of progress throughout the course of the year at the current pace? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say that it should be a strong end market for a number of years ahead. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Got it. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Isaac. Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is open. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks and good morning. I want to ask just around healthcare utilization maybe for the clinical lab, part of the Lab Products and Services business. Just curious what you're seeing there within the 3% organic growth that you put up seeing some signs from HCA put up a good quarter and some of that, I think, is optics, but just really around utilization and your thoughts there. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So in terms of the diagnostics and healthcare, I think U.S. was generally okay in terms of utilization. You still have the pattern, which is incredibly exaggerated meaning that it's now the lowest. That set of activity is Q1 and it builds steadily as people meet their deductible limits during the course of the year. But I think that pattern is roughly normalizing. So you have low level activity, but your growth rates are somewhat similar throughout the quarters. I mean, it's basically what's going on. So nothing dramatic to note in Q1 in terms of utilization. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then just the last one. And leaning sort of into the FX with the cost synergies coming up a little bit for life through year end, I was just curious if it changed your thoughts at all around what you viewed as being the three-year opportunity around what you could potentially earn on that side? Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : In terms of the three-year outlook, we're still holding to the $300 million of cost synergies and $50 million of pull-through on revenue synergies. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Operator : Next question is from the line of Peter Lawson from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Peter R. Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Pete, just with the FX impact, has that made you to think differently about hedging programs or degree of natural hedging or the debt structure? Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Well, we obviously we put in some euro debt last year, which helps a little bit. We're actually seeing a little bit of below the line impact from that. Part of the synergy actions that we're putting in place is trying to convert some of our suppliers to local currency to improve our natural hedging position. We don't have a ton of that. But we are out of sync in a few geographies. So we're working on that. In terms of just regular overall hedging program, we don't intend to put anything in place with regard to that. Peter R. Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: And is there any change in the debt paydown strategy? I'm wondering if you could just talk to the targets again? Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No. We haven't changed our strategy on debt paydown. We're shooting to get down to about between $12 billion and $12.5 billion by the end of the year. That gets us in just below the 3 range so back in our target leverage ratio range. Peter R. Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Great. Thank you so much. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President- Investor Relations : Melissa, we're going to take one more question. Operator : Your last question is from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Capital. Your line is open. Paul R. Knight - Janney Capital Markets : Hi, Marc. Convenient INTERPHEX yesterday looking at your products, the question is where are you with the API (sic) [ASI] (59:37) acquisition and the integration of it? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So in terms of \u2013 Paul, thanks for the question. In terms of the ASI, we closed in February. I had a great opportunity to meet the team there and the integration is going very smoothly. Very complementary to our existing single-use technologies, it brings some new product range as well in terms of connectors, which is an important step in the workflow and gives our customers the choice now of the second film, which for certain biologics would be very useful for them. So it gives us a more complete offering, which we very much value. Paul R. Knight - Janney Capital Markets : So... Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Go ahead, Paul. Paul R. Knight - Janney Capital Markets : On the consolidation within the biological production market, is there much left to do in that market? Is it fragmented or not fragmented in your view? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There's a lot of competitors still out there. So for sure there's quite a competitive landscape. And we have our niches of strength, others have theirs. And so it's an area with great market growth and we have great competitive position, but there's quite a few different companies there out in the landscape. Paul R. Knight - Janney Capital Markets : Great. You seemed excited there. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Paul, thanks. So let me wrap it up. We feel good about our accomplishments in Q1. We are in a great position to deliver another strong year and, of course, we look for to updating you on our progress next quarter and seeing you in New York City later in May. Thanks, everyone.

Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Thermo Fisher Scientific 2015 Second Quarter Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investor section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcast and Presentations until August 14, 2015. A copy of the press release of our 2015 second quarter earnings and future expectations is available in the investor section of our website under the heading Financial Results.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our second quarter 2015 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investor section of our website under the heading Financial Information. So with that, I'd now turn the call over to Marc. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Ken, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our Q2 call. As you saw in our press release, we had an excellent quarter. Financially we delivered strong growth on both the top and bottom line. Operationally our team executed very well and we gained share with our customers. Strategically we continue to execute our growth plans with significant new product launches, good progress in emerging markets, and many examples again this quarter that demonstrate how our unique value proposition is resonating with our customers. We also announced a nice bolt-on acquisition near quarter end, which is an example of how we're continuing to deploy capital to create shareholder value. I'll touch on all these achievements beginning with the financial summary and my end market commentary, then I'll cover some of the business highlights from the quarter and close with our updated guidance for the year. So beginning with the financials. Our revenues in Q2 were $4.27 billion. Our adjusted operating income increased 3% to $950 million. We had good expansion in our adjusted operating margin, which increased 90 basis points to 22.3% and we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.84, which is a 7% increase over Q2 of last year. We fully leveraged our top line growth while continuing to effectively manage the business to offset the FX headwind. The power of our PPI Business System continues to contribute meaningfully to our earnings growth. Let me now put our growth in the context of our end markets. First in academic and government, we saw a good improvement in Q2 as we expected after a soft Q1. Growth here returned to a low single digits. We were encouraged that the proposed increase in NIH funding continues to move forward. While it's not likely to have any near-term impact, if enacted it would certainly be a real positive down the road. In industrial and applied, we didn't see much change with growth in the low single digits in Q2. Our core industrial businesses remain soft while our businesses serving applied markets continued to do well. In particular, we had a very strong quarter in chromatography with high demand for our HPLC and GC products. Turning to diagnostics and healthcare, also not much change here. Conditions in this end market were similar to what we saw in Q1, and we grew in the low single digits. The key contributors to our growth again this quarter were our Clinical Diagnostics and ImmunoDiagnostics businesses. Last, our performance in pharma and biotech was very strong and we grew in the mid-teens in Q2. Given our significant strength here, I want to give you a bit more color on this end market. We believe our performance was driven by a combination of three factors. First, we continue to capitalize on the strong market conditions that we're seeing, especially in biotech. Second, we're effectively leveraging our customer value proposition across our businesses, and that accelerated our excellent growth momentum in this end market. And third, the actions we've taken as part of the integration have fundamentally strengthened the growth trajectory of our BioSciences and BioProduction businesses. The revenue synergies are also starting to ramp up and beginning to contribute to our growth. Let me now highlight some of our accomplishments from the quarter in the context of our growth strategy. We made great progress to set ourselves up for another successful year. As you know, our growth strategy is centered around three things : our leadership in developing high-impact technology innovation, the advantages we have because of our scale in emerging markets, and our ability to leverage our unique customer value proposition to gain share. Starting with innovation, we followed a very productive Q1 with another quarter of significant new product launches, which strikes me is the incredible progress we're making in developing new tools with the potential to have a significant impact on the way our customers identify and treat disease. This is a very exciting time and Thermo Fisher is playing a key role in meeting some of healthcare's greatest challenges. Let me give you a few examples from the quarter. First, you all know that the American Society of Mass Spectrometry Conference is an important venue for us and always presents the opportunity to reinforce our mass spec leadership. This year we celebrated our tenth anniversary of the original Orbitrap. It's as much of a game changer in proteomics today as it was back then, and we continue to build on our leadership. Our latest Orbitrap development is the new Fusion Lumos Tribrid system, which we launched at ASMS to expand our Fusion portfolio. With Lumos, we've improved the two fundamental aspects of system performance that are most important to proteomics researchers. One is intact protein analysis, which allows scientists to perform more comprehensive protein characterization. The other is sensitivity, which is now three to five times greater than the previous Orbitrap systems. During the quarter the Gladstone Institutes at the University of California, San Francisco, opened a Thermo Fisher Scientific Proteomics facility. Scientists there are using our Orbitrap and triple quad technologies to better understand the interactions between genes and the proteins they produce. The goal of this collaboration is to better understand human biology to more effectively target and cure disease. In response to requests from our customers to manage, analyze and share the massive volumes of data generated by this kind of research, we also announced at ASMS that we've extended our Thermo Fisher Cloud platform to support proteomics. This new capability complements our existing cloud platforms for Sanger sequencing and qPCR, connecting scientists, instruments and software in a collaborative multi-disciplined environment. Another highlight from ASMS was our new Q Exactive GC-MS/MS system, which is the first instrument to combine gas chromatography with high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry. This significantly increases productivity for life science researchers, as well as customers working in anti-doping and food safety laboratories by bringing high sensitivity applications to those traditionally served by GC-MS. Turning to AACR, the annual meeting of cancer researchers in the U.S., we extended our QuantStudio portfolio by launching two new real time PCR systems, the QuantStudio 3 and QuantStudio 5. These new products are part of our efforts to accelerate growth in our PCR franchise. At the annual meeting of clinical oncologist called ASCO, we announced our participation in a national clinical trial being run by the National Cancer Institute. The NCI-MATCH Program expects to enroll 1,000 patients across the U.S. in a trial that will sequence genetic information to match these patients with the most effective treatments. Medical facilities in the network will use our Oncomine panel and reagents as well as our Ion Torrent system to sequence as many as 3,000 cancer samples. This is potentially ground-breaking work that is being made possible by our NextGen sequencing technologies which are ideally suited to this targeted panel approach to oncology. One final comment on innovation, we added new state-of-the-art capabilities at our BioProduction facility in the UK for the manufacture of our proprietary dry powder media. This unique granulated formula has all the benefits of traditional liquid media without the associated storage and transportation costs. This format simplifies cell culture production and is used in a range of drugs including an increasing number of cancer therapeutics. Turning to the second element of our growth strategy, emerging markets. First, I want to mention that we returned to double-digit growth in China this quarter, growing in the mid-teens, which is encouraging. Next, I wanted to spend a few minutes on a region that we don't talk as much about, the Middle East. This is a relatively underpenetrated market for us, and in May we opened our first customer experience center in Dubai. This facility showcases a wide range of our technologies, from centrifugation to mass spectrometry and genetic sequencing. We provide training there for researchers, healthcare providers and educational institutions, as well as food and beverage companies. We also plan to collaborate with local universities to train aspiring scientists in the region. The Middle Eastern countries represent a good long-term opportunity for us because they're investing heavily in research, healthcare, food safety, and environment. As we've done successfully in other emerging markets, our strategy here is to increase our direct commercial presence starting with demo and application labs like the one in Dubai. We use this as foundation for building strategic partnerships, and I'm encouraged by the progress we've made so far. The third element of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition. And a great example of how we're effectively delivering it is the growth we're driving within our life science solutions business. As I mentioned in my end market commentary, we are fully leveraging the capabilities of both companies BioSciences and BioProduction businesses as part of our integration plan. Our team has done a fantastic job of combining our offerings here in a way that really resonates with these customers and drives growth. Customers are also increasingly seeing the benefit of being able to buy Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems branded products through our research market channel, and we're seeing some nice incremental growth as a result of that as well. Just to give you a quick update on where we are relative to our synergy targets, we've made great progress on the revenue synergies in Q2 and built on the momentum we had early in the year. As we said last quarter, we expect the revenue synergies to ramp up as the year unfolds. We're at $25 million or the halfway point which puts us right on track to meet or exceed the $60 million in revenue synergies for the full year. In terms of cost synergies, we now expect to deliver $130 million of cost synergies in 2015, which is a $5 million increase over what we discussed last quarter. Before I move on to our guidance, I'll make a quick comment on capital deployment. At the end of the June we announced our agreement to acquire Alfa Aesar, a leading provider for research chemicals for approximately $400 million. This is a complementary bolt-on that strengthens our research chemicals offering, and we expect to complete the acquisition by year-end. The pending Alfa Aesar acquisition is another example of our strategy to effectively deploy capital. If you look at where we are at the halfway point, we bought back $500 million of our stock at the beginning of the year, we've deployed $300 million to acquire Advanced Scientifics in Q1, we've committed approximately $400 million to acquire Alfa Aesar and we pay a quarterly dividend. In total, we're on track to deploy approximately $1.4 billion this year to create value for our customers and our shareholders. Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2015. As you saw on our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance to reflect the impact of current foreign currency exchange rates as well as strong operating performance. We now expect revenue for the year to be in the range of $16.72 billion to $16.86 billion and we are also raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $7.28 to $7.41. This will be a 5% to 6% growth over our strong results in 2014. Given our decision to raise both revenue and earnings guidance, it's clear that we're executing well and we are in a strong position going into the back half the year. So in summary, it was a great quarter. We delivered strong performance, we made excellent progress in executing our growth strategy and we continued to put our money to work to create shareholder value. Before I turn the call over to Pete, as you probably know, this is his last earnings call. Pete has made tremendous contributions in defining and executing our growth strategy during his 11 years as CFO. He also did a great job of preparing his successor, Stephen Williamson to take on this important role. Stephen and I have worked together very closely for a long time and I am looking forward to partnering with him as he takes on the reigns as our CFO on August 1. That said, Pete is extremely committed to Thermo Fisher and has graciously accepted my offer to reconsider his retirement in March 2016 to take on a new role outside of finance. He will serve in a newly created position of executive vice president and chief administrative officer. In capacity, Pete will have responsibility for overseeing some of our corporate functions, which will help me devote more of my time to our customers. Pete is an extremely talented and valued member of the team, so I'm pleased that we'll continue to benefit from his deep knowledge of the company and his leadership. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pete. Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Marc. I appreciate your kind words and I'm very excited about my next chapter with Thermo Fisher. With that, let's move on to the numbers. As usual, I'll begin with an overview of our total company Q2 financial performance, then provide some color on our four segments and conclude with our updated 2015 guidance. As you can see from our results, we had a very strong second quarter and delivered a solid first half. In the second quarter we grew adjusted EPS by 7% to $1.84. This represents very strong underlying operating performance, given that we had a 12% headwind from FX in the quarter. GAAP EPS was $1.27 in Q2, up significantly from $0.69 in the year ago quarter, primarily as a result of lower non-cash acquisition-related charges. On the top line, organic revenue growth was 6% this quarter and our reported revenue was down 1% year-over-year. Q2 reported revenue included a 1% decline from divestitures net of acquisitions and a 6% headwind from foreign exchange. Backlog remained steady in the quarter with bookings slightly ahead of revenue. Looking at our growth by geography, both North America and Europe grew in the mid single digits. Asia-Pacific grew in the high single digits with China growing in the mid-teens and Rest of World grew in the low single digits. We don't normally provide color on Japan, but given our commentary last quarter, I wanted to provide you with a brief update on developments there. As we noted on last quarter's call, the budget was approved in early April. As Q2 progressed, we started to see funding begin to flow and Japan returned to low single-digit growth for the quarter. Looking at our operational performance, Q2 adjusted operating income increased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 22.3%, up 90 basis points from Q2 last year, despite a 100 basis point headwind from FX. At a high level, our adjusted operating margin expansion for the quarter was driven by continued strong contribution from our primary productivity levers : global sourcing, footprint optimization and our PPI Business System as well as continued contribution from cost synergies. Net acquisitions and divestitures were about 15 basis points dilutive in the quarter, driven by the Cole-Parmer divestiture and ASI acquisition. In terms of synergies, we realized $32 million of incremental cost synergies in Q2, and for the full year we now expect cost synergies of $130 million, up $5 million from our previous guidance as a result of continuing to accelerate head count and sourcing synergies. Revenue synergies during the quarter were $20 million, putting us well on track to meet or exceed our full year 2015 guidance of $60 million in revenue synergies with $20 million of adjusted operating income pull-through. In Q2 we continued to make additional strategic investments, primarily to strengthen our core technology platforms and commercial capabilities and accelerate growth. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.0% in Q2, down 100 basis points from the prior year. The decrease was driven primarily by foreign exchange, unfavorable business mix and the ASI acquisition. Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 21.7% of revenue, which is 170 basis points favorable to Q2 2014, driven primarily by volume leverage and our cost synergy and productivity actions. And finally R&D expense came in at 4.1% of revenue, 20 basis points below Q2 last year. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q2 was 6.4%. Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense in Q2 was $95 million, down $18 million from last year as a result of reducing our debt over the last 12 months. Adjusted other income for Q2 was $4 million, which is $3 million higher than Q2 last year, driven primarily by non-operating foreign exchange gains. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14.0%, 30 basis points below last year, primarily as a result of acquisition tax planning. We returned $60 million of capital through dividends in the quarter and average diluted shares were $401.5 million in Q2, down $1.6 million year-over-year, primarily as a result of the share buy backs we completed in Q1 of this year, partially offset by option dilution. Turning to cash flow in the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations for the first half of the year was $849 million and free cash flow was $663 million, after deducting net capital expenditures of $186 million. This is about $160 million lower than the first half of 2014, primarily driven by volume-related working capital investments and the timing of interest and tax payments. We ended the quarter with $770 million in cash and investments, down $100 million sequentially from Q1, as we used surplus cash on the balance sheet as well as cash generated in the quarter to reduce debt. Our total debt at the end of Q2 was $14.0 billion, down $830 million sequentially from Q1, and our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.4 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA. You may have seen that we continue to capitalize on the favorable interest rate environment, having recently completed a $500 million Eurobond offerings consisting of 2.15% seven-year senior notes. We're using the proceeds to pay down short-term debt and pre-fund the Alfa Aesar acquisition. We still expect to achieve a leverage ratio of about 3 times by the end of 2015. To wrap up my comments on the total company, our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in Q2 was 9.1%, up 20 basis points sequentially from Q1. So with that, I'll now walk you through the performance of our four business segments. As I highlighted for the total company, FX was a significant headwind to the top line for our segments and negatively impacted their year-over-year revenue growth to varying degrees. Starting with the Life Sciences Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 2% in Q2 and organic revenue grew 7%. In the quarter we continued to see outstanding growth in our BioProduction business, in addition to very strong growth in BioSciences. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 8% and adjusted operating margin was 28.6%, up 150 basis points. In the segment, margin benefited from very strong productivity and incremental costs synergies, along with meaningful volume leverage. This was partially offset by significantly unfavorable FX and the ASI acquisition. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue decreased 2% in Q2, and organic revenue growth was 4%. In the quarter we had strong growth in our chromatography and service businesses, which was partially offset by continued weakness in some of our core industrial markets. Q2 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 7% and adjusted operating margin was 18.0%, up 160 basis points. In the segment we delivered very strong productivity and good volume leverage, which was partially offset by unfavorable FX and strategic growth investments. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment, in Q2 total revenue decreased 4%. Organic growth was 2%, driven by our Clinical Diagnostics and ImmunoDiagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income in the segment decreased 4% in Q2 and adjusted operating margin was 27.8%, up 20 basis points from the prior year. In the segment, we had strong productivity and solid volume leverage, partially offset by strategic growth investments and unfavorable FX. And finally in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q2 reported revenue was flat to prior year and organic growth was 8%. This segment benefited from our strong performance this quarter in the biopharma end market, with our biopharma services business delivering very strong growth along with good growth across the rest of the businesses in the segment. Adjusted operating income in Laboratory Products and Services increased 1% and adjusted operating margin was 15.4%, up 20 basis points from the prior year. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by strong productivity, partially offset by unfavorable business mix and the Cole-Parmer divestiture. So with that, I'd like to review the details of our full-year 2015 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we're increasing both our top and bottom line guidance as a result of current foreign exchange rates and strong operating performance. On the top line, we're raising both the low and high end of our guidance range and increasing the midpoint by $40 million. This leads to a new full year 2015 revenue guidance range of $16.72 billion to $16.86 billion. The increase in our revenue guidance midpoint is due entirely to the change in FX rates, so we're still expecting organic revenue growth of about 4% for the full year, consistent with our previous guidance. We still expect acquisitions net of divestitures will contribute about 1% to our reported revenue growth in 2015, which excludes any impact from the pending acquisition of Alfa Aesar. Moving to our adjusted EPS guidance, we're raising the low end by $0.03 and the high end by $0.01 to a new range of $7.28 to $7.41. This range represents year-over-year growth of 5% to 6%, which compares to our previous guidance of 4% to 6% growth. To bridge the $0.02 increase in the midpoint of our full year 2015 adjusted EPS guidance, we're driving about $0.05 of improvement from operating performance in the accelerated cost synergies, which is being partially offset by about $0.03 of unfavorable pull-through on the change in FX rates. So to summarize the impact of FX on our current guidance, it's now a $0.70, or 10% year-over-year headwind to our adjusted EPS. So if you were to look at our guidance on an FX neutral basis, adjusted EPS would be growing 15% to 16%, representing very strong underlying operating performance. On the top line, FX is now lowering our revenue by about $950 million or 6%, so our reported revenue growth guidance would be 5% on an FX neutral basis. And in terms of adjusted operating margin pull-through on the FX revenue headwind, we now expect a total impact of $330 million representing an average pull-through of 35% and 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin dilution. The net result compared to our previous guidance is a positive change in revenue of about $35 million and a $15 million reduction in adjusted operating income. The negative pull-through on the increased revenue is a result of the mix of foreign currency exchange rate changes which have varying rates of pull-through along with about $10 million of incremental unfavorable transactional FX. Consistent with past practice, our guidance assumes current foreign currency exchange rates and we haven't attempted to forecast future changes in rates. And, as I mentioned previously, our guidance does not include the recently announced Alfa Aesar acquisition or any other future acquisitions or divestitures. Turning to our adjusted operating margin guidance. We now expect 70 basis points to 80 basis points of expansion year-over-year, which is 10 basis points higher at the low end than our previous guidance. On an FX-neutral basis, our margin expansion would be a very strong 150 basis points to 160 basis points. Moving below the line, we're still expecting net interest expense to be in the range of $375 million to $385 million. We're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14%, consistent with our previous guidance. In terms of capital deployment, we're still assuming that this year will return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends as well as $500 million through share buybacks, which we completed in January. Full-year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of $402 million to $403 million, about the same as 2014, and consistent with our previous guidance. We're expecting net capital expenditures to be in the range of $435 million to $450 million, unchanged from our previous guidance. And, finally, we're still expecting about $2.6 billion of free cash flow for full year 2015, consistent with previous guidance. As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see things playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets, as well as FX fluctuations during the year. In summary, we delivered a very strong top line growth and bottom line results in Q2, which positions us well at the halfway point in the year to achieve our 2015 financial goals. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ken. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Pete. Operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : Your first question is from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks, guys. And congrats, Pete, on the shortest retirement I've ever seen. Maybe just on some of the sequential improvement we saw here, particular on pharma, mid-teens growth was terrific. Can you maybe just help us think about how much of that is a function of the market conditions versus the life synergies versus I guess your value proposition as you described it? Obviously the growth there is driving a lot of the performance. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Tycho, in terms of the pharma biotech end markets, clearly the underlying conditions are strong, but obviously, nothing near the mid-teens type growth. So it's been a good market. As you know, biotech funding has been robust. Pharmaceutical companies are spending more money. But the majority of the very strong performance is driven by how our value proposition is resonating with our customers, and particularly how the underlying performance of our BioProduction BioSciences business is performing with that customer set. Our teams have worked very hard in putting together the two companies' capabilities, and in each of those businesses we're gaining market share and we're also seeing the benefits from our revenue synergies starting to pick up. Obviously, the revenue synergy is not a huge contributor, but it is a nice contributor to the growth in the customer side. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And I guess, speaking about the revenue walk through the back half of the year and guidance, I mean maybe the one thing I think that maybe stands out relative to your prior comments is on China because you're coming off two strong quarters here. Maybe just give us a sense of your thoughts on China in the back half the year? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so the team executed very well in the quarter and executed very well in the first half of the year. Our view is that there are still some overhang in the Chinese market as they work through the anti-corruption efforts, and obviously a little bit slower GDP growth. But, clearly, the conditions in China are better than what we assumed at the beginning of the year and has been a nice contributor to our growth. In terms of the outlook for the second half specifically, hard to forecast exactly, but it should be better than our original assumptions. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then, just last one. Was there a catch-up on China \u2013 I mean Japan? Pete, I know you talked about low single-digit growth. I'm just trying to think about the dynamics following the soft first quarter. How do we think about kind of the catch-up? Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, we really didn't see a catch-up. I mean, actually, the funding is still \u2013 it's flowing but it's still a little bit slow. So I would say it's kind of back to it. It was a normal quarter without any offset from the weakness in Q1. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI : Good morning, and congrats. So I guess it's sort of odd \u2013 two years in a row we've had this dynamic where strong fourth quarter, weaker first quarter, recovery second quarter. I mean, I know you had given us last quarter some commentary that you had been sort of trying to understand the timing dynamic. And obviously we had a bit of a backlog build. Last quarter you had very good orders, so that sort of explains some of the sequential improvement. But as you think about the pacing and predictability in the business, anything new to share in terms of the magnitude of those sort of inflections on a quarterly basis? I mean, we always think of your business as so predictable. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, Ross, the business is quite predictable. If you think about it, we were not concerned after Q1 in our ability to do the 4% organic growth of the full year. And we're not doing victory laps after a strong Q2. We're right where we expected to be at the halfway point of the year. There were a lot of nuances to the calendar. You had less days in Q1 versus the prior year, you had clearly some customers flush some money at the end of the last year that bought some products that they knew they would use and that led to a little bit of a softer start. But we saw that the improvements happening as that first quarter went on and the team delivered a great Q2. And we sit at about 4% organic growth at the halfway point, which is where we want it to be, and we feel confident in our ability to deliver 4% growth for the full year. Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI : Maybe turning to sort of obligatory section on M&A. You guys have been more active on the tuck-in side. It's actually kind of contradictory to what we're seeing in the market. I was listening to our company's call before and there's been a lot of large transactions versus small, which is not unusual, given where we are in the cycle. I mean, I guess is your thinking about the pipeline and the components of value you're seeing in different sub-segments, how would you sort of characterize for life sciences and diagnostics and the various areas you touch activity levels and more so on the mid-size because it seems like that's where you've been more active. How the sourcing and sort of pacing of deals is trending. Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, Ross, in terms of the industry, it's a $100 billion industry. We're the market leader, but we obviously have less than 20% share in aggregate. So still very fragmented, even when you take the largest few players, it's still a very fragmented industry. We have a good pipeline of bolt-on transactions. We've done two that we feel good about it and we evaluate others. And we always have an interesting pipeline on that front. The way I think about it, is we follow our criteria. Is it going to strengthen the company strategically, is it going to be well received and help the customers and clearly is it going to create shareholder value as measured by the rates of returns on those investments. And we were able to do two transactions and we'll continue to look at that pipeline over time and I think we're in a good position from the ability to deploy capital to create shareholder value. Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI : Great. And lastly, so I guess, Pete, congrats on staying. Is it possible we'll get you to do cameos down the road and maybe pop in on earnings call? I was just coming to grips with you leaving and so now that you're back, I'm excited about maybe you participating a little bit more. So, is it too big of a request to ask you to come back maybe once a year and pop in? Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So the only cameo you might see, Pete, is certainly not in the finance or the earnings calls, but maybe you'll see him occasionally with a tennis racquet or golf after hours. But you'll have to reach out that way. One of the things is that for clarity, I think it was after the period where Pete reflected on the transition to CFO and was able to take a deep breath and feel totally confident in Stephen that he and I started to talk about the next chapter of his life. I think he can add enormous value by not spending time on the finance function but rather helping us build our capabilities and strengthen the company in some other areas. So no more cameos for Pete here, but you can always reach him on non-financial related topics. Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, Ross, I'm very happy to be doing my last earnings call. Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI : Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good afternoon or good morning. Hey, Marc, can I just clarify your China comments? You talked about feeling a little bit better about the second half. Is that optimism driven by your backlog and the orders you have in hand? And so this leads to the question of how much visibility you have so is this certain China macro instability something we need to worry about in 2016? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, it's a good question. In terms of visibility in China, it's less than what it used to be, say a couple of years ago, but it's not perfect. My comment really is saying we were expecting the company average for the year, when we gave the original guidance, and we've been growing. We grew high single digits in Q1, mid-teens in Q2 and we're likely to grow certainly better than the low single digit type growth, mid single digit growth for the full year. So that's really the reflection on the comment. Visibility, I think it's going to take some time before you get back to very clear visibility in China because they're still working through a lot of changes in the government. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And I guess I have to ask the obligatory NIH question and is that \u2013 how are you thinking about what's going on there? And I believe when we had you on the road recently you were still thinking that maybe the budgets could give you somewhere between 25 bps and 50 bps of incremental organic revenue growth if they go through with things. Is that still sort of your thinking on it? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, the way I think about it, I don't expect the budgeting process and things like the 21st Century Cures to have any impact in this calendar year, but could set us up for a very attractive growth environment for the NIH and US academic and government going forward, should those things become law. So those are really good, important pieces of legislation, and if we can get those enacted, that clearly is going to be a big improvement in the NIH funding. I think it's almost $9 billion of funding over the upcoming year's period. So it could be super exciting if it goes through the process. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Operator : You next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from UBS. Your line is open. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Great. I'll offer my congratulations to you, Pete, and good luck with the new role in the future. And we look forward to seeing you on the tennis court, as Marc said. Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Jon. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : So, Marc, I want to follow-up on kind of your comments. You mentioned and I was kind of just \u2013 this morning doing the same thing, 2% first quarter, 6% this quarter, so first half you're sitting right at 4%, which is what you expect for the year. If you look at this quarter, I think what will really stand out to people is obviously that biopharma, and in particular, I think that Life Sciences Solutions growth of 7%. Many people thought that business might actually grow below the organic rate of the company. So can you maybe dive in a little bit and give a more specific example? I think you mentioned that the third action point of kind of growth in BioSciences and BioProduction really helped out biopharma and I'm assuming that's somewhat tied to what's happening in Life Science Solutions. So can you maybe provide a little bit more detail or specific details about the actions that you took? And then secondly about, kind of for the second half of the year, do you expect biopharma to keep growing at this mid-teens rate or high single digit rate, let's call it, and the rest of the businesses to stay low single digit? Or is there something you see that makes you think that maybe diagnostic and healthcare, industrial or something there could get a little bit better in the second half? Thanks. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, good questions in a bunch, too. Let me start with the broader end markets and then I'll hit the specifics within the Life Science Solutions and what's going on there. If I think about the second half, we wouldn't expect pharma and biotech to be at that same torrid pace of Q2, but certainly will be a strong end market for us in the second half of the year. And our expectation is that fairly similar conditions in the academic government and diagnostics and healthcare and industrial and applied in the second half than it was in the first half. Probably slight improvements from where they are, but not particularly material and when you kind of walk through the math, that sort of gets you to the 4% growth. Within the Life Science Solutions segment, the team has done a great job in leveraging the combined capabilities of the company. And that is, obviously there was a lot of redundant cost and there has been an interesting \u2013 driving of great earnings growth, but also reinvestment in certain parts of the business, as well. While we have been raising synergy targets, we've also been able to strengthen the fundamentals of the business. You're seeing nice impact innovation in the BioSciences business. That is clearly helping accelerate the growth there. And commercially, both BioProduction and BioSciences is really leveraging the strength of the excellent commercial footprint that Thermo Fisher Scientific has in serving that customer set; leveraging our channel but also leveraging the corporate accounts and the strong relationships and the combination of good innovation and good commercial execution has put that business on a nice growth path and that's helped us, both in the biopharma customer set, but also helped us strengthen our Life Science Solutions business. When you go back to our Analyst Meeting in May, we expressed our confidence in changing the long-term outlook from 3% to 4% organic growth for that business, and we feel good about that. And I think a quarter like this shows you some of the early progress that we're making in strengthening the growth outlook for the business. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : That's helpful. And then if I could just quickly, as you look at your end markets again, I mean, if you go back to the lives (44:14) again, one could kind of argue that you looked out and said maybe people are too down on government and academic in the long run and it's not such a bad market. Are there any markets you're seeing like that right now that maybe people are too euphoric in one area but maybe discounting another that you think are good markets? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: When you think about the business that we have, we serve four end markets. They're slightly off-cycle from one another, which actually allows us to deliver very consistent growth. Because it's unlikely that all four are going to be in a trough, and it's unlikely that all four are going to be at a robust period. So you get this nice effect of getting steady, organic growth over long periods of time. In terms of the longer-term outlook, we've had, obviously, choppy academic and government end markets for a while, and things like the 21st Century Cures which pulls through, things like a recovery longer-term in China from \u2013 can be things of help that end market. Will that be a robustly growing market? No. But could it be better than where it is today? Sure. Over time I think that's probably the one that you'd see opportunities. Within Thermo Fisher, we're very bullish on the long-term prospects for our healthcare and diagnostics business and see that over time being one of our faster growing markets, particularly because we're driving the penetration of Life Science Tools into that market. So things like mass spectrometry, NextGen sequencing will be longer-term growth drivers for that end market, and we think that we're well positioned to get very good growth there over time. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, Marc. Helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open. S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning. S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Marc, I guess, sticking with the theme, if we look at the LPS business and the volatility in that segment's core revenue growth, I mean, there are one or two things that you attribute to the volatility we've seen more recently in the growth rates, which is above what this business used to \u2013 how it used to perform, and, I mean, given the high mix of consumables in the channel business, would expect, I guess, a little more consistency. Does that normalize at some point in your view? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think that the Laboratory Products and Services business performed really well, and if you look back over the last few years, I mean, it really has been one of the nice growth drivers for the company. In the quarter, all three of the businesses that make up the segment, our Lab Products, our Customer Channels, and our BioPharma Services business, had a really good quarter, and so I feel good about it. In terms of why softer Q1 and then a stronger Q2 really reflects what's going on at the company level, it's not particularly segment thing. You get the same days of calendar effects in that business as you would elsewhere in the same days of the budget flush in Q4 starting out with a weaker start. So, it's a good grower for the company and one that is the heart of our customer value proposition. So, I think it's a nice growth driver going forward, as it has been historically. S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : And then one more for Pete. Would be curious if you could break out the effect of currency and mix, just the components in the gross margin in the second quarter. Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. So the year-over-year bridge between 49% last year and 48% this year in gross margin, we had about 75 basis points of headwind as a result of FX and about 80 basis points of unfavorable mix, that's both segment and within segment mix. And then obviously very good productivity, over 100 basis points. S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Super. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, everyone. The progress in China is nice to see. It's very much in line with \u2013 maybe a little bit ahead of what you had anticipated, but I take your comments to mean that you don't anticipate \u2013 and this is, of course, pretty normal for Thermo \u2013 anything along the lines of let's say a budget flush in China in the latter stages of the year. As we talk to industrials companies and tools companies, it seems like opinions on the likelihood of some sort of budget flush are really all over the map. It'd be interesting to hear your thoughts on that. Why is it you think there are divergent opinions and what are you watching to get a sense for whether any acceleration in China is a function of that in the latter stages of the year is reasonably possible? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, in terms of the \u2013 whether you would have outsize growth at the end of the year, it really is hard to forecast that. And if I think back in my 15 years with the company, it's really something that we don't actually spend a ton of time on in terms of what's going to happen in December in that particular market. Generally the macro trends are pretty favorable in China because GDP growth there is faster there than anywhere else in the world roughly, and the needs for our products; environmental protection, food safety, healthcare expansion are right there in the sweet spot. So, we always think that long term that we're well positioned to have outsize growth in China and get a little less focused on what's going to happen quarter to quarter. I will be there again next month and look forward to working with the team and visiting a bunch of customers, and maybe in the Q3 call I'll have a little more color on how we see the very end of the year playing out. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then incremental to your comments around the $1.4 billion of capital deployment this year, it's always helpful just to hear how you're thinking about the gating factors for any incremental share repurchase. Are we waiting to see what comes through from the M&A funnel? Are there other gates we ought to consider? And, again, I will thank you guys for all the help this morning. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So, right now with the $1.4 billion that we have deployed and expect to deploy, that would put us at the three times leverage ratio approximately at the end of the year, which really sets us up for a great position going into 2016. We do evaluate share buybacks from time to time, and we do have an authorization. But at least at this point we're not expecting anything in the super short term. And then we plan to get back to a more normal capital deployment as we get into 2016. But we're always flexible depending on what's going on in the end markets and what's going on with the stock price at a particular point in time. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Co. Your line is open. Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. How would you describe the pricing environment? Really what I'm getting at is how does it compare to recent periods and given that the value proposition is clearly working more and more? Is the outlook improving for pricing in the coming quarters? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, in terms of the pricing environment, actually Q2 was a strong pricing environment for us. One of the things that we mentioned at the beginning of the year with the foreign exchange headwinds where we were going to take some incremental actions on pricing and we saw some of the benefits of that. So at the halfway point of the year, Doug, we're a little bit above 50 basis points on price, which is good. It's a little better than what we've been experiencing over the last couple years. So, that's going in the right direction and generally a pretty stable price environment. Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, And a clarifying question on guidance or I guess just that's framed by guidance. As you noted and provided a lot of detail, so thanks for that, Pete. You increased revenue growth guidance largely due to FX, but you actually indicated that FX is an incremental drag on EPS. Is any of that reflective of changes in what you're expecting by geography? Essentially have your growth assumptions by geography that are imbedded into overall guidance, have they changed? Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : No. It's really being driven by just the respective changes in foreign currency exchange rates. So, for instance, compared to our previous guidance, the yen, which pulls through at about 60% is up 2.5% \u2013 or declined by about 2.5%, while the pound, which is pull through less than 5% actually went up by 3.5%. You can see just those two currencies, which are two of our significant currencies, you end up with positive revenue and negative pull-through. So it's just the relative changes in the currencies. Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And one last one. You guys had a really strong Analytical Instruments margin performance in the quarter. I think you were up 130 basis points sequentially, 160 basis points year-over-year. I think it's fair to say that was better than many expected in a quarter where I think the organic growth was solid but about as expected and FX remained a tough headwind. Is there any additional dynamic to kind of walk through here just to kind of explain that solid performance and the sustainability moving forward? Thank you. Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, in terms of year-over-year improvement 150 basis points, really solid improvement there. We had great productivity. Probably 50 basis points or so above what our normal run rate would be. We had really good pull-through on the incremental revenue. And that, obviously, was a little bit offset by foreign exchange, which was a pretty significant headwind. I would say this is an outsized level of expansion. So I wouldn't expect that every quarter going forward. But really good performance this quarter. Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, again. Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, good morning, guys. Thank you. A question first on diagnostics. I used to think of that business as being maybe a mid to high single-digit growth area. And last year, I appreciated a little bit of a tougher comp in 2Q versus 1Q. But just wondering kind of how you're looking at the growth rate there and wondering if it was \u2013 whether it was transplant diagnostics or maybe another area? If there was something that's been sort of weighing on the growth rate that could either abate or turn for the better. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so Isaac, good morning. In terms of the diagnostics and healthcare, no \u2013 really if I think about the first half of low single-digit growth, first quarter you had the calendar. And in the first half a little bit weaker seasonal on both flu and allergy relative to the prior year. So those are really the factors there. The way I think about is I agree with you. I think on the mid-term and beyond is actually one of our faster growing businesses. Transplant did fine, so no issues there. So I think it's more just as you see some of the new products get launched in future periods, you'll see that growth pick up over time. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's helpful. And then just another question on bioprocess. I think you touched a little bit qualitatively on how that's going. But wondering if put some rough numbers? It seems like that market was off to a hard start for everyone in the first quarter, and I'm assuming that was the case. But just wondering if you can put some numbers around bioprocess this quarter as well as your expectations for the balance of the year? Thanks. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It's a strong business for us. It was a meaningful contributor to our growth within the Life Science Solutions segment, and certainly of a meaningful scale business, our fastest growing business. So really a good performer. On the specific numbers it's well above the company average. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks a bunch. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Marc, could you provide some additional color on the biopharma end market? I guess specifically what I'm looking for is what do you see in large pharma, kind of spec pharm, biotech, and what are the growth rates there? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So biotech by far the fastest-growing subset. You may recall a few quarters ago I talked about and certainly we reinforced, Alan Malus reinforced at the Analyst Meeting. Our push from how we approach our customers, we had great momentum with large pharma to really expand our efforts with biotech. And that clearly is paying off, right? So the biotech funding environment as you know is very strong and that's translating into spending at the Life Science Tools level, and we're well-positioned to capitalize on it. But our Big Pharma customers are doing well, right? Their pipelines look better and more drugs are getting approved and we're very well-positioned because of our value propositions. So we're seeing good growth there with our larger customers as well. So biotech is strongest, but not really any particular points of weakness within that customer set. Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): That's great. And a follow-up on the chromatography strength. I guess how would you position this? Is this mainly a factor of the new products and execution on your side, or are you seeing any disruption in the competitive environment that you're taking advantage of? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No disruption on the competitive front. We have good competitors in the field. In terms of \u2013 we had really good strength. Our team did a nice job. Ion Chromatography did well, the liquid chromatography did well and gas chromatography did well in the quarter. So really good strength between the instruments and consumables, so just really solid execution. New products help, but that wasn't a material driver of the very strong performance. Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks a lot. thanks, guys. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President- Investor Relations : And, Operator, we have time for just one more. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is open. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks. And thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to ask one more or the policy side with the NIH funding. And just as you're talking with customers today, I know think you're thinking about this maybe as being more of a 2016 helper. But just if you're seeing anybody preparing ahead of the bill, and then whether you think you could actually bleed over from academic into any other customer segments? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We have a lot of dialogue with our academic and government customers, and I would say that it is \u2013 no one's spending in advance of it. I think that a lot of folks are trying to push to get these things over the goal line because it would be good for the U.S. and certainly good for their own environment. So you have a lot of folks rallying to get it through, but I don't think anyone is spending yet. I don't think that in the short term it will bleed into other segments, but I do think strong NIH funding actually positions biotech pharma and the diagnostics segments better, because there is clearly a spillover. So pumping more money into that from a government perspective is a huge positive for the eco system down the road. So, as you know, I'm a big believer in the NIH. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, got it. And then, just the last one on the LPS strength. I was just curious on the clinical side of the market, whether you've seen any sort of changes in the volume dynamic in the U.S. that you thought was helping there and driving some of the robust growth the past couple of years? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, nothing particular. The clinical exposure in that segment is a little bit less than the company average. So not really a big driver there. So thank you for the question. Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So before Marc makes his closing comments, I just wanted to say how much I've enjoyed being CFO for the past 11 years. And I'm really going to miss interacting with our investors and sell side analysts. As you know, Stephen and I have worked together for 15 years. He knows the company as well as I do and I'm very confident that he'll do a great job as CFO and continue to work with Marc and the rest of the team to take Thermo Fisher to the next level. Stephen Williamson - Vice President- Financial Operations : Thanks, Pete. I'm really excited about the new role. I hope to meet many of you during the course of the year. I look forward to updating everyone on our Q3 call in October. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So with that to wrap up we had an excellent Q2. We're in a great position to deliver another strong year and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the next quarter. Thank you, everyone. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks Ken and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our Q3 call. I'm pleased to report that we delivered a solid quarter with good growth on the top and bottom line. Q3 is another example of how we're successfully executing our growth strategy and increasing our depth of capabilities to gain market share. We had another great quarter for innovation with important new product launches across our businesses. We are leveraging our scale in APAC and emerging markets as a key differentiator and we had another strong quarter in China. We also continued to make good progress in capturing revenue synergies using our expanded technology portfolio, our commercial capabilities and global reach to show our customers the power of our value proposition. With a strong nine months behind us, we're on track to achieve our growth goals for the year. Before I get into the business highlights for the quarter, let me start with the financial overview and some color commentary on our end markets. Then I will conclude with our updated guidance outlook for the year. So in terms of the financials, our revenue in Q3 was $4.12 billion. Our adjusted operating income increased 2% to $934 million. We achieved adjusted operating margin of 22.6% which represents 70 basis points of margin expansion. And finally we extended our track record of consistently delivering strong adjusted EPS growth. We achieved $1.80 of adjusted EPS which is a 5% increase over Q3 of last year. We drove good pull through on our top line growth, using our PPI Business System to increase our operating efficiencies and provide the highest quality products and services to our customers. Our solid results again this quarter demonstrate our ability to effectively manage the business, despite the FX headwinds and achieve our growth goals. So starting with our performance by end market, we didn't see much change in Q3. In industrial and applied our performance was similar to what we've seen all year with low single digit growth. Our core industrial businesses remained soft, while those serving applied markets again performed well. We had good growth in our analytical instrument businesses serving environmental and food safety markets. We also had another strong quarter in our chromatography business. Turning to diagnostics and healthcare, our performance in this end market was pretty similar to what we've seen in first half of the year with growth in the low single digits. The key contributors in Q3 were our clinical diagnostics business and our healthcare market channel, which continued to grow well. In academic and government, we grew again this quarter in the low single digits. Conditions in this end market were basically similar to what we experienced in Q2. Last, I'm pleased to say that we had another excellent quarter in pharma and biotech which grew for us at just over 10%. We continue to capitalize on the strength of this end market overall and effectively leverage our unique value proposition, which really resonates with these customers. We had strong performance across our businesses that serve this end market and particularly in biosciences, bioproduction, and biopharma services. Let me now highlight some of our accomplishments from Q3 in the context of our growth strategy. We continue to make great progress on all fronts which positions us for another successful year. As you know, our growth strategy is centered around high impact technology innovation, leveraging our scale in Asia Pacific and emerging markets and delivering our unique value proposition to best serve our customers and gain share. In terms of innovation, Thermo Fisher has by far the largest R&D budget in our industry at approximately $700 million annually and we continue to target those investments that create the most value for our customers. Let me hit some of the highlights from Q3. First, in September we introduced the new Ion S5 and Ion S5 XL, next-generation sequencing systems. This is a significant development that builds on our Ion Torrent platform. It makes targeted sequencing more accessible to customers working in academic, translational and clinical research labs. The key advantages of both systems are that they're cost effective and flexible, giving scientists the ability to sequence gene panels as well as small genomes, exomes and transcriptomes on a single platform. We're also making great progress in developing new products that improve the speed and accuracy of test results in the clinical laboratory. At the Annual Meeting of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, we launched a number of new Thermo Scientific instruments and assays designed to help clinicians improve patient diagnosis and treatment. Let me mention a couple of them. We launched three new immunoassays that have been FDA cleared for detecting autoimmune diseases. These new EliA assays can help diagnose multiple conditions that could be precursors to kidney disease. We also introduced the Phadia 2500E instrument which is now configured to run both our EliA autoimmunity and ImmunoCAP allergy tests to significantly increase lab productivity. In our analytical instruments business, we introduced a new HPLC system, a Thermo Scientific Prelude LX-4 MD which is listed with the FDA as a class I medical device for general in vitro diagnostics use. The Prelude LX-4 significantly enhances sample throughput for high volume clinical settings. Also worthy to note, during the quarter we obtained CE marks for our Prelude MD HPLC, Endura MD mass spec and related ClinQuan MD software, which were all previously introduced in the U.S. This designation gives clinical labs in Europe access to advanced technologies for analyzing patient samples using laboratory developed tests. Let me take a moment now to highlight an example that demonstrates how our customers are recognizing the value we can create through our unique depth of capabilities and our reputation as a scientific thought leader. We've been collaborating with the Biotech Research and Innovation Center at the University of Copenhagen to help researchers better understand how gene mutations can lead to cancer progression. Scientists there recently published two landmark studies in the scientific journal, Cell. Their work was based on results generated by our Orbitrap Fusion mass spec and our Ion Torrent next-gen sequencing technologies. These studies offer insight into human cell biology that may eventually lead to more effective cancer treatments and better outcomes for patients. This is a great example of the new capabilities we're now able to deliver to our customers, based on our successful integration of Life Technologies. Just to give you a quick update on where we are relative to our revenue synergy target, we continue to make great progress in Q3 building on the momentum we've had all year. With nine months behind us, we're at $50 million, which positions us to slightly exceed our revenue goal for the year. Turning to APAC and emerging markets, China seems to be on the top of everyone's mind, and I've been getting a lot of questions about it. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter in China which contributed to good growth for us in APAC overall. Our China strategy is clearly working and we delivered 15% growth in Q3. We continue to work with the government and our customers to meet their goals for improving healthcare, the environment, and food safety. Back in August, I had the opportunity to visit some of these customers with our team in China, and their feedback reinforces why our technologies are well positioned there. Here are a couple of observations from my trip. It's great to see our high-end instruments in customer labs there. Our Q Exactive HF and Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass specs are being used for proteomics research and our next-generation sequencing technologies are helping to advance oncology research. We also supplied our gas and particulate monitors to ensure that air quality was safe after the widely publicized chemical warehouse explosion in Tianjin. I think this is an example that illustrates why the diversity of our technology portfolio is a key advantage in addressing China's needs. The investments we've made in our China Innovation Center are also bearing fruit and we have a number of our products soon to be launched that have been designed specifically to meet the needs of the local market. So we have great momentum with our customers, our team is executing well and we continue to feel good about our prospects for growth in China. In other emerging markets, we continued our strategy of expanding our presence to position us for growth. And the most recent example is an investment that we made in Brazil. We opened a new Customer Experience Center in S\u00e3o Paulo to serve markets across Latin America. This center is a showcase for our analytical capabilities and allows us to partner with customers to help them achieve their goals by developing new methods using our technologies. We made this investment in Brazil despite the current economic challenges that this country is facing in the short term because we believe it will position us for market share gains as the customer and funding environment improves. Before I move on to our guidance, I'll make a quick comment on capital deployment. Just after quarter end, we completed our acquisition of Alfa Aesar for approximately $400 million, to expand our offering of laboratory chemicals. This is a nice complementary bolt-on that gives our customers access to a much broader portfolio, whether working in research or production. It's another great example of how we strengthen our strategic position by leveraging our scale and customer reach. In terms of capital deployment, we bought back $500 million of stock in January. We deployed $700 million to make two strategic bolt-on acquisitions and we continue to return capital to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend. So, we've deployed a total of $1.4 billion for the year-to-date in order to create value for our customers and our shareholders. Now, let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2015. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect revenue for the year to be in the range of $16.81 billion to $16.91 billion. We're also raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $7.33 to $7.41. This equates to 5% to 6% growth over our strong results in 2014. So in summary, it was a great quarter. We delivered solid financial performance. We made excellent progress in executing our growth strategy and we continue to make wise investments to create shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As usual, I'm going to begin with an overview of our total company financial performance, then provide some color on our four segments and conclude with our updated 2015 guidance. So starting with our overall financial performance for the third quarter, as you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 5% to $1.80. GAAP EPS in Q3 was $1.18, up 1%. On the top line, we achieved organic revenue growth of 4% this quarter, and our reported revenue was down 1% year-over-year. Q3 reported revenues included a 6% headwind from foreign exchange and a neutral impact from acquisitions net of divestitures. And please note that the components of the Q3 change in revenue do not sum due to rounding. And bookings were slightly less than revenue in the quarter but grew organically in all four segments. Looking at our growth by geography, both North America and Europe grew in the mid-single-digits. Asia Pacific grew in the high-single-digits, with China growing in the mid-teens, and rest of the world declined in the mid-single-digits. Looking at our operational performance, Q3 adjusted operating income increased 2% and adjusted operating margin was 22.6%, up 70 basis points from Q3 last year, despite 110 basis points of headwind from foreign exchange. At a high level, our adjusted operating margin expansion for the quarter was driven by continued strong contribution from our primary productivity levers, global sourcing, footprint optimization and our PPI Business System, as well as continued contribution from cost synergies. To add some color on our synergies, we realized $32 million of incremental cost synergies in Q3, in line with our full year target of $130 million. And revenue synergies during the quarter were $25 million. And, as Marc mentioned, this puts us in a great position to slightly exceed our full year, 2015 target of $60 million of revenue synergies. We've been able to accelerate our actions and are on track to deliver the $150 million of revenue synergies in 2016. In Q3, we continued to make additional strategic growth investments and primarily to strengthen our core technology platforms and commercial capabilities. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.3% in Q3, down 80 basis points from the previous year. The decrease was driven primarily by foreign exchange and unfavorable business mix. Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 21.5% of revenue, which is 140 basis points favorable to Q3 2014, driven primarily by foreign exchange, cost synergies and our productivity actions. And, finally, R&D expense came in at 4.2% of revenue, flat to Q3 last year, and R&D, as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q3, was 6.5%. Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense in Q3 was $93 million, down $13 million from Q3 last year as a result of reducing our debt over the past 12 months. Adjusted other income for Q3 was $2 million, which is flat to Q3 last year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14%, 80 basis points below last year, primarily as a result of realizing the benefits of our acquisition tax planning. And average diluted shares were 402 million in Q3, down 1.7 million year-over-year, primarily as a result of share buybacks we completed in Q1 and partially offset by option dilution. So turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations through Q3 was $1.6 billion. And free cash flow was $1.31 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $286 million. We ended the quarter with $505 million in cash and investments, down $265 million, sequentially from Q2 as we used surplus cash on the balance sheet, as well as cash generated in the quarter, to reduce debt. We returned $60 million of capital through dividends in the quarter and just after the quarter end, we spent approximately $400 million on the acquisition of Alfa Aesar. Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $13.3 billion, down $700 million sequentially from Q2, and our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA. We still expect to achieve a leverage ratio of about three times by the end of 2015. And wrapping up my comments on the total company performance, we continued to make progress on our ROIC, a trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in Q3 was 9.3%, up 20 basis points sequentially from Q2. So with that, I'll now provide you with some color on the performance of our four business segments. As I highlighted for the total company, foreign exchange continued to be a significant headwind to the top line for our segments and impacted the year-over-year revenue growth and adjusted operating margins to varying degrees. Starting with the Life Sciences Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 1% in Q3, and organic revenue grew 5%. In the quarter, we continued to see strong growth in our bioproduction and bioscience businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 30.8%, up 220 basis points. In the segment, adjusted operating margin benefited from very strong productivity and incremental cost synergies, along with some favorable product mix, partially offset by significantly unfavorable foreign exchange. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue decreased 1% in Q3 and organic revenue growth was 5%. In the quarter, we had strong growth in our chromatography and service businesses, which was partially offset by the continued weakness we've seen in some of our core industrial markets. Q3 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 6% and adjusted operating margin was 18.8%, up 130 basis points. In the segment, we delivered very strong productivity and we experienced favorable product mix, which was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and strategic growth investments. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment, in Q3, total revenue decreased 4% and organic growth was 1%. This was driven by good growth in our clinical diagnostics and healthcare market channel businesses, partially offset by the expiration of an OEM contract within this segment. Adjusted operating income in this segment decreased 9% in Q3 and adjusted operating margin was 26.4%, down 120 basis points from the prior year. In the segment, unfavorable foreign exchange, product mix, and strategic growth investments were partially offset by productivity initiatives. Finally, in the Lab Products and Services segment, Q3 reported revenue increased 1% and organic growth was 7%. This segment continues to benefit from our strong performance in the pharma and biotech end markets, with our biopharma services business delivering very strong growth, along with good growth across the rest of our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income in this segment increased 1% and adjusted operating margin was 15.2%, up 10 basis points from the prior year. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by productivity improvements, partially offset by strategic growth investments. So with that, I'd like to review the details of our full year 2015 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we're increasing both the top and bottom line guidance, primarily as a result of somewhat better foreign exchange rates and the acquisition of Alfa Aesar which, as I mentioned, closed shortly after the quarter end. From a revenue standpoint, we're raising both the low and the high end of our guidance range, and increasing the midpoint by $70 million. This leads to a new full year 2015 revenue guidance range of $16.81 billion to $16.91 billion. Of the $70 million increase in the midpoint, approximately $40 million is due to the slightly improved foreign exchange environment and $30 million relates to the addition of Alfa Aesar. So we're still expecting organic revenue growth of about 4% for the full year 2015, consistent with our previous guidance. Acquisitions net of divestitures now contribute a little over 1% to our reported revenue growth in 2015. Moving to our adjusted EPS guidance, we're raising the low end by $0.05 to a new range of $7.33 to $7.41. This range represents a year-over-year growth 5% to 6%. The midpoint of the new range is $7.37, a $0.025 increase from our previous guidance. And to bridge the $0.025 we're driving about $0.01 of improvement from the acquisition of Alfa Aesar, $0.01 from improved foreign exchange, and about $0.005 from below the line items. Our current adjusted EPS guidance has a $0.69 or 10% negative impact from foreign exchange. If you look at our guidance on an FX neutral basis, adjusted EPS would be growing 15% to 16%, representing very strong underlying operating performance. On the top line, foreign exchange is now lowering our revenue by just over $900 million, or about 5%, so our reported revenue growth guidance would be 5% on an FX neutral basis. And in terms of adjusted operating margin pull through on the FX revenue headwind, we now expect a total impact of about $325 million, representing an average pull through of 36%, and 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin dilution. The change in foreign exchange compared to our previous guidance is an increase in revenue of about $40 million, with a pull through of approximately 15%. Consistent with past practice, our guidance assumes current foreign currency exchange rates and we haven't attempted to forecast future changes in rates. And as I mentioned previously, the guidance now includes the acquisition of Alfa Aesar, but does not include any other future acquisitions over divestitures. Turning to our adjusted operating margin guidance, we expect 70 basis points to 80 basis points of expansion year-over-year, which is unchanged from our previous guidance. On an FX neutral basis, our margin expansion would be a very strong 150 basis points to 160 basis points, also unchanged from previous guidance. Moving below the line, we're expecting net interest expense to be about $385 million, slightly higher than our previous guidance and we're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14%, consistent with our previous guidance. In terms of capital deployment, we're still assuming that this year we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends as well as $500 million through share buybacks which we completed in January. Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be $402 million, slightly lower than our previous guidance, and we're expecting net capital expenditures to be in the range of $395 million to $410 million, down $40 million from our previous guidance. And finally, we're still expecting about $2.6 billion of free cash flow for full year 2015, consistent with our previous guidance. As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see things playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets as well as foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the rest of the year. So in summary, we delivered another solid quarter in Q3, which positions us well to achieve our 2015 financial goals. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. First, I'm wondering actually if you can call out Japan. I didn't hear that in the prepared comments. Obviously that's been a source of weakness for some of the other companies in this space. I know it was a little bit soft last quarter, so can you maybe just touch on dynamics there? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Tycho. Good morning. Asia Pacific was strong for us in the quarter. We had great strength in China. Japan grew but in a muted fashion, not materially different than we would have expected. There's clearly some government budgeting challenges, which means that the next quarter may be a little muted, but given the strength we have in China, it shouldn't be a significant factor for Thermo Fisher. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then a question on visibility in some of the core end markets. I mean, if we look at kind of what's going on in the industrial world, obviously the data points have not exactly been encouraging from some of the companies that have reported thus far; in particular, with oil and gas exposure. Can you maybe talk on your visibility into the industrial channel over the next couple of quarters? And then similarly with pharma, you've obviously had great strength there over the past year, maybe just talk about the sustainability of those trends and obviously, with the biotech funding window shutting, whether maybe there is some sensitivity around that? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so in terms of those end markets, Tycho, the core industrial business that we serve has been weak now for a protracted period of time and our assumption is it's going to continue to be in that state. So we did not see a further deceleration. It's been a soft end market and we've been able to power through that in terms of our driving results. So that is what it is. Applied markets, however, are continuing to have good strength. Our environmental markets, food safety was strong and, as I look forward to the next couple of quarters, the applied markets also benefit from a very nuance thing, which is in the U.S. the Coal Miner Safety Act actually has a deadline in terms of when air monitoring has to be done. And that goes into effect February 1. So we had a couple of nice things going on on the environmental side that helps us on the applied and we're making the assumption that at least for the next couple of quarters, if not longer, we're going to be in a muted industrial outlook. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then biopharma? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. In terms of pharma and biotech, I could talk about pharma and biotech forever. We're well positioned there and the market is doing great. 10% growth in the market. Clearly, as we saw in the last few quarters, the market is a little better than what it has been, say, in the previous few years. That's primarily because drugs are getting through the FDA process and getting approved. So the customers are getting a return on their R&D investments and they're spending money. And we are really well positioned with this customer set. We have incredible access to the executives at all level in these organizations. They understand our technologies and how we help drive both their productivity and innovation. And you are seeing very strong momentum across our entire portfolio from bioproduction, based on a lot of what's going on on the biotech front. Biosciences, it's a result of the synergies, if you will, in terms of leveraging the Thermo Fisher strength with these customers and biopharma services is just a great business that continues to drive momentum. So we feel good about the position for biopharma. Clearly lots of headlines about pricing and it seems to be a political hot potato that obviously is something we pay attention to, but as long as drugs are getting through the pipeline and they are making progress there, we feel that this is going to continue to be a good solid end market for us. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then just lastly, with valuations getting cheaper in the market, does that change the pace of maybe some of the M&A discussions? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, in terms of the M&A, we always have this huge pipeline of activity where we're always exploring different opportunities, and then it becomes a question of when the value creation is going to work for us. So we're looking at things as we have for the last many years and we have an interesting pipeline and should the right deal line up then you'll see us do it, and if not, we'll just get back to normal capital deployment, which is coming up soon, we're only a couple of months away from 2016. Thanks, Tycho. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Derik. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Can you talk a little bit about the OEM customer in Specialty Diagnostics and sort of what's the monetary impact of that is? I mean, what would have growth been without it? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so good question. In terms of the Diagnostics business, we had sunsetted or we had an expiration of a contract with one OEM customer at the end of 2014. The particular customer was acquired by a competitor somewhat before that, so we knew that contract was going to come to an expiration. It was about two points of organic growth headwind in the segment in the quarter. It will be about a one point of headwind in the fourth quarter and then it is gone. It was totally baked into our guidance at the beginning of the year. It's something we knew. We knew it's more of a backend impact on this particular segment and so it's one of those things that will be behind us and positions our diagnostics business well through the other actions we're taking. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And then just my other quick one. So you're tracking in the Life Sciences Solutions business at about 4.6% averaging organic revenue growth, so nice 5% average. Is that a sustainable, something in that 4% to 5% range going forward, given where the markets are? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So as we said back in May, we raised our outlook from 3% for this segment to 4% and every quarter that we are doing 4% or better will give us more confidence that it could be higher, but we want to deliver this for a while before we create a new norm. But the team is doing a really good job of executing in our Life Sciences Solutions business. They're leveraging the capabilities of the rest of Thermo Fisher to drive growth and improve our competitive position, so more to come on that over time. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome, Derik. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore. Please go ahead. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good morning, guys. I guess I just want to get back to the emerging market discussion. So obviously some of the more industrial focused countries, Russia, Brazil, et cetera have been troubled for some time, but I guess many of us are kind of surprised by the resilience of China. I guess, Marc, you spent a ton of time over there, as you think about sort of the underlying drivers, your confidence in the duration, a little context would be helpful. And then help us understand the pacing, I realize you don't have anything out there formally for next year, but the pacing of that market as we get into 2016, just because it seems like the comps will get a little more difficult. So help us frame what that trajectory could look like? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So, Ross, in terms of emerging markets, for us this year, China is performing very well. India is performing very well. Obviously, Russia is really, really soft, right? So it is what it is. And if I go back and I think about my 15 years at the company, there's always puts and takes in emerging markets. There's very few periods where everything is robust. So it's kind of a portfolio, which is why you typically invest in the downturn in some of these markets, so you're positioned when the funding improves. While the investment we made in Brazil was not large by any sense, it was more of a statement that we're in these markets for the long term, we have important customers and as things improve we're capitalizing to seize on where the funding is. In terms of China, the team has doing a really good job. They're really executing very well and they're gaining shares as far as we can tell, through all the data we look at. What I would say is the industrial business there has been pretty muted for a while. And what's driving the growth really is the applied markets and the needs on the applied markets are very, very, very substantial, right? In terms of water issues, air pollution issues, and food safety issues, there's a huge need. And what was encouraging was to see that the food safety portion of the business is clearly picking up, which gives a encouraging view that some of those spend will be positive. China, in this environment, is very hard to forecast. So, we're certainly not in a position to talk about 2016 yet. What I can say is that we had good bookings in the quarter which positions us for a solid year in terms of China for 2015 and that's good. To me, it's about making the most of the opportunities and our team is doing a good job of pivoting to where the funding is in the Chinese market. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Got it. And maybe just on Specialty Diagnostics, we'll stick back there. So a lot of dislocation, at least amongst the public players, in the diagnostic universe. You play in some unique niche markets. How do you think about the evolution of your strategy there and where you sit today and how to think about some of the dislocations that have happened, whether it's from an M&A standpoint or a warning of staying away from certain markets. And then your appetite maybe to move upstream and to other parts of that complex, or maybe other things with sort of a more medical bias? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So, Ross, in terms of the end markets and in this sort of the market landscape, it's a very fragmented market. We pick very carefully where we play and where we don't play. Right? We want to have good, sustainable industry structure in this segment so that you can maintain really nice profitability with a reasonable rate of growth. And that's how we played it out. We've built enough scale so that when we launch new technologies we can reach those customers easily. You know we have a focus in clinical oncology. In the sequencing business, you are hearing us talking about some launches from our analytical instruments. That all leverages the scale we have in that market. So over time, do I think there's going to be bolt-on M&A activities in the diagnostic realm? Absolutely, it's incredibly fragmented. We've got a good track record in the acquisitions that we've done there in generating really good returns. So when we see the right opportunities, we'll pick them up. And what's important to reinforce, there's nothing we have to do here, right? We have a great portfolio with a great position. So we look at them and say where do we think we can uniquely make businesses better and create value for our shareholders Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Great. Thanks, Marc. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from UBS. Please go ahead. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, and congratulations, Marc, on a solid quarter and the team. I guess the main question I have for you, Marc, is if you look at book-to-bill, it's below one, it's kind of for first time in a while. I know you kind of don't \u2013 you recommend don't getting too focused on book-to-bill. So I'm just curious how you're thinking about that metric and, maybe, where you saw orders that didn't come in as quickly as revenues in the quarter? Stephen Williamson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Hi, good morning, Jon. This is Stephen. So, I'll take this question. The book to bill was just below 1. For the year-to-date, it's actually just slightly above 1. And we had good bookings growth across all four segments this quarter, so no areas of concern on the book-to-bill. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then I guess, Marc, if I look at again at acquisitions for the year, you've been kind of silent, and I'm curious. I guess, I have a little different take. Do you think that given the pull back in some of the public equity prices; do you think that makes M&A more or less likely? You have some sellers who maybe are still thinking about valuations where they were. And how would you expect M&A to influence your 2016? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I like the acquisitions that we've done. I like ASI. It serves the bioproduction segment, which is one of our fastest growing businesses and that integration has gone smoothly. Alfa Aesar is an incredibly complementary acquisition in terms of strengthening both our channel business and our global chemicals business. And I think we'll generate very strong returns there as well. In terms of the landscape, we're always looking at things, and the way that I think about it is the depressed stock prices relative to two months ago, probably doesn't reduce the price you pay for an acquisition, but it certainly would increase the odds of an acquisition happening. And I'm not saying there really is... I don't think you get a bargain because the stock is down from where it was a short while ago, but I think people say, well, God, I have to work hard to get back to it. So it becomes a little bit easier on some of those things. So I don't think it's materially different, Jon, but that's how I would handicap it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks, and good morning. I wanted to start and just ask about the Lab Products and Services segment. Now two quarters with really nice high-single digit growth. Just what are your thoughts on the sustainability of that growth in the near term? And what have been some of the areas of strength there? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: A great question. So, generally, the way we think about this is a business that generally grows in line with the company average. It has a larger exposure to biotech and pharmaceutical end market, given that the biopharma services business resides there and our channel business resides there that has strong presence. So what you're seeing right now is with a very robust performance by us in the biotech and pharma market. That shows up there disproportionately, but it also shows up in Life Sciences Solutions, it shows up in our chroma and mass spec business with Analytical Instruments. But it really gets highlighted in Lab Products and Services segments. So as long as biotech and pharma continues to do well and we continue to execute well there, we should be driving pretty good growth out of LP&S. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it, that makes sense. And then just one bigger question, I guess, related to something that was asked earlier. Just around all the change that's happening in the market today around lab reimbursement, I was curious how you thought that could impact the business for Thermo or for some of your customer segments? Thanks. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thank you. So In terms of reimbursement, there's a lot of recent press around U.S. reimbursement for certain lab tests. We've been in this environment globally for a while, right? Where you have a situation where countries are trying to keep their healthcare costs under control. And we've been able to navigate that successfully by working with our customers to help them maximize the reimbursement that they can get for their capabilities. We're making substantial investments in our health economics team, which is really what justifies why health systems around the world should be using our products. So that's part of the response. When I think about the most recent dialog in the US, clearly it would affect some of our customers, particularly in the drugs of abuse area. It's not a huge business for us, but given that we offer different methodologies that have different reimbursement rates, a lot of what we're doing with our customers now is helping them position the testing in a way that they can get properly reimbursed for their products. So we will work hard to navigate through any impacts from what's going on in some of the preliminary discussions on U.S. reimbursement. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Doug. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Let me just start with a couple of, I guess, follow-up questions. On pharma, revenue growth has ranged between mid-single digits to mid-teens for the past seven quarters. I don't have the 2013 figure in front of me, but I think that was a pretty good year for that end market as well. So recognizing what you said in response to Tycho's earlier question, the comps are getting tougher and there are some building concerns about some recent developments in this end market. So as we think about the next few quarters ahead, are the fundamentals and, frankly, the value proposition that's unique to Thermo enough to overcome what really is, if nothing else, a mathematical challenge of continuing to drive growth in this end market that has been close to 10% for at least a couple of years? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, when I think about the performance, and I was looking back to 2013 as well, we grew high single digits in 2013 in pharma and biotech. We've been able to deliver that mid to high-single digit growth. Obviously, this year we've had a couple of quarters above that. Again, some difficult comparisons. We're going to have difficult comparisons next year, but we're really well positioned here. And when I think about our end markets in aggregate, I feel good about our outlook. There's always some puts and takes in the various markets, but we're well positioned here. When I think about the dialog we're having with our big pharmaceutical customers and the dialog we're having with our small biotech customers, there are so many of them, I remain bullish about the outlook for these end markets Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then really a follow-up on China, I don't know if you would be willing to get this specific, but could you share anything on the book-to-bill there and would you confirm that assumptions that you have embedded into full year guidance specific to China remain unchanged? And then any insight you could provide on what you think we should expect with the release of the new five year plan over the next few weeks? Stephen Williamson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Good morning, Doug. So the book-to-bill is a positive book-to-bill. It's over 3% above revenue. So we've had good bookings all year really for China. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So in terms of the outlook for the year, we didn't really do much in terms of guiding by China. We kind of called it \u2013 we took a pass on it saying it was just the company average because it was hard to forecast at the beginning of the year. Clearly, China is growing meaningfully above it and has offset some other things, right? So we feel good about delivering the 4% organic growth for the full year, and like every other year, you do it using a slightly different way than what you think you're going to do at the beginning of the year because it's our job to put the resources where the best opportunities are. So China has been good, the team has executed well. It's offset some softness in other markets and we feel good about the short-term positioning there. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then the five-year plan, any insight there, Marc? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The five-year plan only to the respect that at least \u2013 obviously, they don't release it early. The priorities that have been driving our growth over the last number of years around health care expansion, food safety and environmental seem to be highly likely that those will continue to be priorities. So while they haven't published it yet, we feel like these are things that have been a priority for China and are likely to continue to be a priority going forward. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks so much for taking the questions, guys. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Doug. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, good morning. Thanks. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Maybe just one for me on the biopharma side. Marc, you're obviously having a lot of success with the large players there. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're finding the ability to be a strategic partner with some of the smaller emerging biotech companies? And the reason I ask is I'm just trying to understand how spending might be post a funding event for these guys over time? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're well positioned with the smaller biotech. You may recall a couple of years ago we started to expand our coverage model. We always called on those customers, but calling on them as a company level as opposed to a business level and that's worked really well. Even if the spend might be pre-IPO, it might be $1 million or $2 million with a decent-sized startup, over time, those spends really can grow with the ones that have product developments making it through the pipeline. So we're serving those customers well. We're doing a really good job of leveraging our capabilities there. So we think that in terms of biotech, as they convert their cash into products moving through the pipeline, we'll be one of the beneficiaries of that. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe if I could just move to the academic markets, could you just give a sense of how you are seeing spending there? Is there any reason to believe that spending patterns in the fourth quarter will be different than previous periods where you've had a CR or is there some dynamic ahead of 2016 that you might think would be pertinent? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we've been growing low-single-digits in the end market. It's very hard to forecast what's going to happen with the U.S. government. Clearly, we play a very active role in making sure that the government stays open and I do actually spend time on that because it's disruptive to our customers when we get into that debate. But right now, it looks like at least for the next month or two, it looks like things will continue to be funded and hopefully we'll get to a period where we get out of this very short term environment. There's some really better things on the mid-term, the 21st Century Cures and so just a general dialog around the NIH is much more positive. So if we can ever get to a period where we can get a budget done, we should benefit as our customers will benefit from improved funding. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): All right. Okay. Thanks very much. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, guys. Thanks a bunch. First question on pharma, could you maybe comment on the strength you saw this quarter, the extent to which you thought market share might have helped relative to the actual growth rate in the underlying end markets? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Isaac, it's pretty hard to pin down what the market share is versus the end market. I need to see what some of the other companies report to get the very crisp feel to that. But what I would say is in that growth there's not, like, big account flips. What it really is is just good share of wallet execution, just picking up share at our existing customers, driving more biosciences revenue, capitalizing on our strength of biopharma services, and bioproduction continues to be very strong for us. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And then just a follow up on diagnostics, if we look at sort of the nine months year-to-date trend over a couple of years, the two-year stacked comp, so to speak, kind of looks like a low-single-digit number. I imagine your ambitions in diagnostics are to grow a little faster. What do you think is going to take to sort of realize the sustained growth rate that's above the corporate average? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so in terms of the business there, when I think about the mid-term for the business and the long-term, we have some really cool products in the product development pipeline that we've foreshadowed a little bit and you're seeing some of the earlier versions of those. That will help drive very good long-term growth. In the short-term at this level, I would say primarily, what you're looking at is you've got one contract that we're just sunsetting at the end of the fourth quarter that creates a little bit of a headwind this year. But other than that, it's pretty normal rate (52:32) in terms of where it is. So I love the long-term outlook and it's a great profit generator for us with moderate growth in the very short-term as we've been going through this expiration. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks a bunch. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of follow-ups. Maybe I'll start first on the revenue synergies. You spoke in some detail about how revenue synergies with the integration are going this year, tracking a little ahead of plan. I wonder if you could give us a bit of incremental color on how that's tracking, specifically where are you seeing things play out a little bit better than you might have expected. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Steve, great question. So really what you are seeing is things are driving results faster. They are materializing a little faster than we expected, so basically our revenue synergy plans were kind of zero in year one, $60 million in year two, $150 million in year three. That was roughly the ramp-up. And we'll do a little better than $60 million and it puts us in a great position to achieve the $150 million. The thing that is a real highlight for us in this year, in the second year of our integration, really is is how effectively the channel business and our Life Sciences Solutions businesses are working together. So that execution has gone very well. What's to come is more around the e-commerce platform and leveraging that. And you probably have noticed that the thermofisher.com looks differently than it did a few months ago. And you now see it much more commerce-oriented as we integrated a couple of our key web properties. And you'll see more product access on that platform over time. So we have a lot of really cool things in process. Our customers are recognizing it and it's really helping drive nice growth for the company and nice growth for the Life Sciences Solutions segment. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then the last one for me actually comes back to pharma, maybe a little bit of a finer point. As you think about end of year and the tendency for budget flush in pharma, how are you budgeting for that potential budget flush? Do you assume that there is a budget flush? And if so, is it similar to last year, higher or lower? How are you thinking about those dynamics? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So \u2013 Steve, thanks. It is always challenging to know how customers will spend at the end of the year. The last two years we've had very strong year end spending. We assume a reasonable level of year-end spend. And when I think about the fourth quarter, as I just think about, sort of, how to look at the revenue growth, what you have is the benefit of an extra day, which is good. And you have a very challenging comparison, which is a headwind. But when we put it all together, we still feel very good about our ability to deliver the 4% organic growth for the full year. So that's our view and you really don't know on the budget flush, literally until the last two weeks of the year, is really how that plays out. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks again. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : You've done a solid job this year offsetting the FX headwinds with cost actions. Should we expect any variable costs to come back into the model next year? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. In terms of the way we've managed through it, basically, we've pushed pricing harder, selectively. We're having a good year on pricing. We did manage our cost base tightly. We always manage our cost base tightly. We put a little bit more emphasis. But we did the right things for the long-term health of the business as well. So you're not going to see cost come back in because of something we did this year. In fact, you'll see us drive meaningful productivity as we get into 2016 as well. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. And then one more follow-up for Stephen. In terms of the full year free cash flow outlook of $2.6 billion. I mean, that would imply about as much cash as you've generated year-to-date coming in the fourth quarter. Can you just help me bridge the dynamics of really how you get there in the fourth quarter? Is there anything one time or unique? Stephen Williamson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, sure, Brandon. So, yeah, so we're just over $1.3 billion year-to-date. And when I look at Q4, Q4 is always, historically, our strongest cash flow quarter. And then when you think about the year-over-year dynamic, two significant items, really, cash taxes and cash interest in 2015 have pretty much largely been done in the first three quarters, which wasn't the case last year. So very little cash tax, cash interest payments in Q4, which helps us drive a strong cash flow \u2013 free cash flow in Q4. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Super. Thank you. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President- Investor Relations : And operator, we're going to take one more. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert W Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, thanks for sneaking me in. Really, had two follow-ups on the last set of questions. Marc, you talked about pricing being strong selectively. I guess, can you give us an update on where pricing is at? And the second follow up is on PPI. Obviously, that program has been a huge home run for you guys. Can you talk about your visibility into future initiatives to help keep up that strong pace of margin expansion that you've been seeing? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So pricing, which over the last few years has bounced around between 0.5% and 1%, it's probably in the range of about 0.75% year-to-date, Q3 was stronger than that. So we're having a good year on pricing from that perspective. And in terms of PPI, it's who we are. Right? I mean it's how we operate, it's how we come to work every day in terms of driving productivity and efficiency and it will drive meaningful opportunities. When we talked about our longer term goals of getting our margins to 24% to 26%, PPI is a key contributor to doing that and it gives us great confidence in our ability to have really solid growth prospects in terms of earnings for many, many, many years to come. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So with that let me wrap it up with just a couple of quick things. One, thanks for joining us today. We had another solid quarter. We're in a great position to deliver another very strong year at Thermo Fisher Scientific and we look forward to reviewing our year-end results in early February. Thanks, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and thanks, of course, for joining us today for our Q4 and year-end call. As you saw in our press release, we ended the year on a very strong note, delivering excellent fourth quarter results. Our teams identified and capitalized on year-end opportunities, delivered our value proposition to help our customers meet their objectives, and executed well to achieve our goals for the year. I think our performance demonstrates that no matter what we're facing in the macro environment, we have many opportunities to gain share. At the same time, we're steadily expanding our capabilities in line with our growth strategy, and this gives us even more potential to create value for all of our key stakeholders : customers, employees and shareholders. I'll cover some of my business highlights of the quarter and the year later on in my remarks, but first I'll give you a summary of our financial performance, discuss our growth relative to our key end markets, and wrap up with an overview of our annual guidance for 2016. So starting with the quarter, we grew our adjusted earnings per share by 7% to $2.12, continuing our long track record of strong adjusted EPS performance. Our revenue in Q4 grew 4% year-over-year, our adjusted operating income increased 5%, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 40 basis points to 23.2%. Looking at our Q4 performance in the context of our key end markets, I'm pleased to say that we did a great job of capitalizing on year-end opportunities to deliver strong growth overall. Starting with industrial and applied, our performance was similar to what we've seen all year with very low single-digit growth. Our industrial businesses remained soft while our businesses serving applied markets continued to perform well, particularly our analytical instruments used for environmental and food safety applications. As an example, I'm very pleased with the performance of our chromatography business. Some of this is due to the success of the Vanquish UHPLC system we launched a little over a year ago. But fundamentally, the benefits of the Dionex acquisition in 2011 are really playing out. We're seeing strength across our entire portfolio from HPLC to GC to ion chromatography as well as software and consumables. Turning to diagnostics and healthcare, it was good to see stronger results in this end market in Q4. We delivered mid-single-digit growth with especially strong performance in our clinical diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses. In academic and government, conditions in this end market were the strongest we've seen all year. We executed well to take advantage of strong spending at the end of the year in the U.S. and Europe and we delivered mid-single-digit growth. It's good to see positive momentum in this end market, and we're encouraged about our prospects here given the more favorable funding environment in the U.S. in 2016. Last, I'm pleased to say that we capped off a very strong year in pharma and biotech with another outstanding quarter with growth in the mid-teens. We're clearly benefiting from the underlying strength of this end market and the power of our customer value proposition, which is creating a significant competitive advantage for us and drove strong performance across our businesses that served this end market. Our results show that in this economic environment, our customers turn to us to help them be successful, whether they're driving more innovation or increasing productivity to fund those R&D investments. Our scale and depth of capabilities is a key differentiator that creates value for our customers across our end markets. So in summary, we took full advantage of the year-end opportunities, executed well and delivered very strong Q4 performance that led to a great year overall. Now, I'll transition to our full year results. The main take-away is very clear : we achieved all the goals we set out to achieve. It wasn't the easiest of environments, but with thoughtful planning, great operational execution and intense focus on our customers, we delivered another strong year. Among our key objectives in 2015, we focused on meeting or exceeding our financial commitments, making good progress in advancing our growth strategy, capturing the synergies from the Life Technologies acquisition and strengthening our balance sheet. I'm pleased to report that we accomplished each of these objectives and I'll cover them in a bit more detail, starting with the financials. Obviously, it was a challenging environment from an FX perspective and the strengthening of the dollar impacted every multinational company. But we effectively navigated those headwinds, which Stephen will discuss later in his remarks, and achieved what I feel was a very solid year. We delivered $7.39 of adjusted EPS, which was a 6% increase year-over-year despite an 11% headwind from foreign exchange. We grew revenues to a record $16.97 billion for the full year. Adjusted operating income increased 3%, and we achieved adjusted operating income margin of 60 basis points to 22.5%. Let me take a moment here to give you some insight into how we're thinking about margin expansion. As you know, we've been able to steadily expand our operating margins over the years. We do this by leveraging our PPI Business System and all the levers we have to drive margins, whether it's pricing, sourcing or footprint optimization. You can see in our results that we did a great job of expanding margins despite a very significant FX headwind. Given that we will continue to face FX challenges in 2016, we remain very focused on driving productivity by continuing to use our operational levers. We've also decided to take some additional actions that will help us further down the road. We will fund those additional productivity actions through the benefits we gain from the temporary repeal of the medical device tax. This will enable us to further strengthen our operating margins going into 2017. We have a substantial opportunity to expand our margins and we still think it's reasonable to take them to the 24% to 26% range by 2018. So we delivered solid performance for the year by staying true to our growth strategy and making sure that every decision we made put us in a stronger position in the eyes of our customers. Now, let me hit some of the highlights and accomplishments from the year and from the quarter in the context of our growth strategy. As you know, it's based on three elements : developing high-impact innovative new products, capitalizing on our scale in Asia Pacific and emerging markets, and leveraging our unique customer value proposition. The success of this strategy creates a significant competitive advantage for us and that gives us many opportunities to gain share. Starting with innovation, 2015 was another very strong year for us. I covered our new product highlights during the course of the year, so I'm not going to get into much detail today. We did have strong launches serving the research scientists as well as for our customers working in clinical and applied markets. Starting with the research community, the big news last year was our launch of the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer for proteomics. We actually just learned yesterday that the Lumos was voted by customers who read SelectScience magazine as the Best New Drug Discovery Product of 2015. Our industry-leading Orbitrap platform gives us a foundation for expansion into a range of applications, and we continue to fully leverage that capability. We also had a number of exciting products launched in genetic analysis, but let me just mention a couple of them. One was our cloud-enabled QuantStudio 3 and 5 real-time qPCR systems, which support our increasing focus on oncology. The other was the new Ion S5 and S5 XL product line, which makes targeted next-gen sequencing more accessible for a range of research applications. Moving to the clinic, we introduced a number of new immunoassays during the year as well as a new Phadia instrument that effectively leverages our customers' capital investment by running tests for both allergy and autoimmunity. One example from the quarter that I do want to highlight is our collaboration with the Karolinska Institute of Sweden on a groundbreaking clinical study aimed at developing a more effective test for prostate cancer. Using our proteomic, genomic and assay technologies, this test can predict, or more precisely, distinguish between benign and aggressive cancers, thus reducing the number of biopsies required without compromising the number of actual cancers diagnosed. These are early days and there's still much more work here to be done, but it's very exciting and may be an alternative to the PSA test. This development would not have happened without the ability to leverage all of these capabilities across our company. Turning to applied markets, our new Q Exactive Focus LC/MS created a powerful alternative to Q-TOF technology for a number of applications, including toxicology, pharma QA/QC, food and environmental analysis as well. The Focus is really gaining traction and significantly contributed to our growth in our Analytical Instruments business in Q4. So as you can see, 2015 was another outstanding year for innovation. We put our R&D dollars and expertise to work to deliver high-impact products that help our customers achieve their goals. I look forward to discussing the exciting innovations we plan to launch during 2016 as the year unfolds. Let me now turn to the second element of our growth strategy, which is about using our scale as a competitive advantage in Asia Pacific and emerging markets. You saw in our press release that we highlighted China growth. Well, I have to steal Stephen's thunder a little by telling you that we achieved high-teens growth in China in Q4. Really outstanding performance by the team. The question I get a lot with China is how have we been doing so well given the magnitude of change taking place in that country. Well, from my perspective, I think it boils down to two things. First, China has challenges that we are in the best position to help our customers address, like poor air and water quality, unsafe food supplies, and strains on their healthcare system. The second reason is that we've taken advantage of our scale but also have a very localized approach to running our business there. We have a team that understands the market and where the funding is and has executed very well. Let me give you one example from the quarter, which is a new product we launched from our China Innovation Center in Shanghai. Contaminated water is a big issue there and some important new regulations were put in place by the government to control various water pollutants. We worked closely with our customers to understand their requirements and launched the Orion 3106 COD water analyzer in Q4. In addition to it detecting pollutants, this new product will also help our customers lower their operating costs by reducing maintenance and reagent consumption. During the year, we also expanded our capabilities to capture opportunities in other emerging markets such as Southeast Asia. Our most recent development was the November opening of a new GMP biopharma clinical services facility in Singapore to serve the growing needs of pharma and biotech customers in the region. Our strong performance in 2015 shows that we're effectively leveraging our global scale to best serve our customers and drive growth. Turning to our customer value proposition, the third element of our growth strategy. I think the best example here is our successful integration of Life Technologies. We had high expectations for this business when we acquired it two years ago, and it's been a home run for us, not only in terms of the financial benefits but also in strengthening our customer offering and the strategic position of our company. Regarding the financials, the metrics we laid out in early 2015, which were higher than the original deal model, were $115 million of additional cost synergies and $60 million of revenue synergies for the year. I'm very pleased to report that in 2015, we delivered $130 million of cost synergies and ended the year at our target year three run rate. In terms of revenue synergies, we really gained early traction here and achieved approximately $90 million of revenue synergies in 2015, much faster than we anticipated. This performance puts us in a great position to achieve our 2016 revenue synergy goals. From a customer perspective, we have a clear advantage as a result of combining our capabilities across the company. Our bioproduction and biosciences businesses are now growing faster than they were independently. Having genetic and protein analysis technologies in one company is creating exciting new opportunities, like the prostate cancer test I mentioned earlier. And the commercial presence we now have by combining our channel and e-commerce capabilities is really starting to drive growth. In terms of our strategic position, at our Analyst Meeting last May we said we expected Life Sciences Solutions to grow organically at 3% or better for the year, and I'm very pleased to report that the business grew organically at 5% in 2015, which contributed to our strong performance for the company overall. This is a great example of how we put our capital to work to create value for our customers and our shareholders. Let me now give you a quick update on our balance sheet. You know that last year we were focused on delevering, following the Life Technologies acquisition. I'm pleased to tell you that we achieved our target leverage ratio of 3 times leverage at the end of 2015. This timing is slightly ahead of what we expected when we announced the transaction, and we accomplished this while repurchasing $500 million of our stock early last year and paying about $240 million of dividends as well as spending $700 million on two complementary bolt-on acquisitions. To remind you, ASI strengthened our capabilities, serving the high-growth bioproduction market, and Alfa Aesar expanded our offering of chemicals for the research laboratory. So we put ourselves in a great position from a balance sheet perspective as we begin 2016, and we're able to kick off the year by announcing our agreement to acquire Affymetrix. Many of you are familiar with this business, which is a leader in cellular and genetic analysis. Affymetrix has a strong position on flow cytometry and antibodies, which will strengthen our biosciences offering. It was also the pioneer of microarray technology and will be a nice complement to our genetic sciences business. This transaction also offers attractive financial benefits. We expect $0.10 of adjusted EPS accretion in the first full year of ownership, and we also expect to generate $70 million of synergies by year three following the close. So, good financial returns and also a very good fit for our Life Sciences Solutions business. Let me now turn to our guidance for 2016. Stephen will cover the details and outline all of the assumptions for our revenue and earnings guidance, but I'd like to make a couple of comments. Our 2016 guidance reflects the fact that foreign exchange will continue to have a negative impact on our top and bottom line performance, although we anticipate to a lesser degree than it did in 2015 based on where rates are today. So, we're guiding to adjusted EPS in the range of $7.80 to $7.96. This would result in 6% to 8% growth over the $7.39 we delivered in 2015. In terms of the revenues, we expect to deliver between $17.36 billion and $17.56 billion in 2016. So before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me leave with you a few take-aways. We focused on our customers and effectively navigated the macro environment to achieve our goals for the year. We continued to innovate, expand our global reach, and enhance our customer value proposition in line with our growth strategy. We also strengthened our balance sheet so we can resume our normal capital deployment in 2016 and identify new opportunities to create shareholder value. With that, I'll now hand over the call to Stephen Williamson, our CFO. Stephen? Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Marc and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our Q4 and full year 2015 financial performance for the total company, then I'll provide some color on our four segments and conclude with a detailed review of our 2016 guidance. So starting with our overall financial performance for the fourth quarter, as you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 7% to $2.12. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $7.39, up 6% from 2014. The midpoint of our guidance that we gave you at the end of Q3 was $7.37 of adjusted EPS for the full year 2015. Subsequent to this guidance, the negative foreign exchange impact on Q4 increased significantly, resulting in a further $0.06 of headwind in the quarter. I'm pleased to say that we're able to offset all of this and still able to deliver $7.39 for the full year, $0.02 more than the midpoint of our last guidance. GAAP EPS was $1.50 in Q4, up 1% from $1.49 in the prior year's quarter and $4.92 for full year 2015, up 4% from $4.71 in 2014. On the top line, we delivered 7% organic revenue growth this quarter and our reported revenue increased 4% year over year. Q4 reported revenue includes 1% growth from acquisitions, and a 4% headwind from foreign exchange. For the full year 2015, reported revenue was flat year over year, and organic revenue growth was 5%. Full year reported revenue includes 1% growth from acquisitions, net of divestitures and a 6% negative impact from foreign exchange. Looking at the growth by geography in Q4, North America grew in the mid-single digits, and Europe grew in the high-single digits. Asia-Pacific grew in the low double digits, and as Marc mentioned, China was growing in the high teens. And the rest of the world declined in the high-single digits. For the full year, both North America and Europe grew in the mid-single digits. Asia-Pacific grew in the high single digits and China growing in the mid-teens. And the rest of the world declined in the low-single digits. So looking at our operational performance Q4 adjusted operating income increased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 23.2%, up 40 basis points from Q4 last year, despite an 80 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 3%, and adjusted operating margin was 22.5%, up 60 basis points from 2014, despite a 90 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. At a high level, our adjusted operating margin expansion from the quarter and the full year was driven by continued strong contribution from the PPI Business System productivity levers, including pricing, global sourcing and footprint optimization, as well as the continued contribution from cost synergies. In Q4, we realized $18 million of cost synergy benefits from the Life Technologies acquisition, and $130 million for the full year 2015. And as Marc said we were able to accelerate the capture of revenue synergies and realized $40 million during Q4 and $90 million for the full year 2015. This puts us in great position to deliver on the three-year run rate target of $150 million of revenue synergies in 2016. We took advantage of our strong performance in Q4 to make additional strategic investments primarily to strengthen our commercial capabilities and to accelerate growth. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 47.7% in Q4, down 130 basis points from the prior year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 48.3%, down 50 basis points from 2014. The decreases in gross margin in both Q4 and the full year are primarily attributed to foreign exchange and unfavorable business mix. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 20.6% of revenue, which is 150 basis points favorable to Q4 2014, driven primarily by foreign exchange, cost synergies, and our productivity actions. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 21.7%, 120 basis points favorable to 2014. And finally R&D expense came in at 3.9% of revenue in Q4, 20 basis points favorable to Q4 2014, and full year R&D expense was 4.1%, flat to full year 2014. And R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue for full year 2015 was 6.4%, also flat to the full year 2014. So looking at our results below the line, net interest expense in Q4 was $94 million, down $13 million from Q4 last year, as result of reducing our debt over the past 12 months. Net interest expense for the full year was $384 million, a decrease of $48 million from 2014. Adjusted other income for Q4 was negative $7 million, $16 million lower than Q4 2014, and for the full year, it was $6 million, which is $7 million lower than last year. Both driven primarily by non-operating foreign exchange net losses in 2015, compared to net gains in 2014. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13%, 20 basis points below last year. Our full year rate was 13.7%, down from 14.5% in 2014, primarily as a result of realizing our benefits of our acquisition tax planning. And average diluted shares were 402.4 million in Q4, down 1.7 million year over year, primarily as a result of the share buybacks we completed in Q1, partially offset by option dilution. For the full year, average diluted shares were 401.9 million, down 0.4 million from 2014. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations for the year was $2.83 billion, and free cash flow was $2.42 billion, after deducting net capital expenditure of $405 million. This is slightly lower than our previous guidance due to additional investments in working capital. We ended the year with $455 million in cash and investments. During 2015, we continued to return capital to shareholders with $500 million of share buybacks in Q1 and $240 million of dividends, including $60 million of dividends in Q4. We also continued to make strategic acquisitions in 2015, spending $300 million in Q1 to acquire ASI, and $400 million in Q4 to acquire Alfa Aesar. Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $12.5 billion, down $800 million sequentially from Q3 and we achieved our year-end target leverage ratio of 3 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA. And wrapping up my comments on our total company performance, we continue to make progress on our ROIC. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in Q4 was 9.5%, up 20 basis points sequentially from Q3 and up 60 basis points from Q1 2015, when the Life Technologies acquisition was fully included in the average investment base. So with that, I'll now provide you with some color on the performance of our four business segments. As I highlighted for the total company, foreign exchange continued to be a significant headwind for the top line for our segments and impacted their year-over-year revenue growth and adjusted operating margins to varying degrees. Starting with Life Sciences Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 2% in Q4 and organic revenue grew 5%. In the quarter, we continued to see strong growth in our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. For the full year, reported revenue grew 6% on organic growth of 5%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 31.6%, up 80 basis points, benefiting from very strong productivity and incremental cost synergies, partially offset by some unfavorable product mix, significantly unfavorable foreign exchange and strategic growth investments. For the full year 2015, adjusted operating margin was 30.1%, 110 basis points higher than the prior year. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 3% in Q4 and organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter, we had strong growth in our chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses, partially offset by weaknesses that we continue to see in some of our core industrial markets. For the full year, reported revenue declined 1%, and organic growth was 4%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 13%, and adjusted operating margin was 22.1%, up 190 basis points. We delivered very strong productivity in this segment, partially offset by foreign exchange, unfavorable mix and strategic growth investments. For the full year 2015, adjusted operating income increased 5%, and adjusted operating margin was 19.1%, 120 basis points higher than 2014. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q4, total revenue grew slightly and organic revenue growth was 4%. This was driven by good growth in our immunodiagnostics and clinical diagnostics businesses, partially offset by the expiration of the OEM contract that I mentioned on our Q3 call. For the full year, reported revenue declined 3%, and organic growth was 3%. Adjusted operating income in the segment decreased 3% in Q4 and adjusted operating margin was 26.2%, down 90 basis points from the prior year. In the segment, we drove very good productivity; however this was more than offset by the expiration of the OEM contract, unfavorable foreign exchange and strategic growth investments. For the full year 2015, adjusted operating income decreased 5%, and adjusted operating margin was 26.9%, down 50 basis points from 2014. And finally in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q4 reported revenue increased 8%, and organic revenue growth was 10%. This segment continues to benefit from our strong performance in the pharma and biotech end market with the biopharma services channel and Laboratory Products businesses all delivering very strong growth. For the full year, reported revenue grew 1% and organic revenue grew 7%. Adjusted operating income in this segment increased 9%, and adjusted operating margin was 14.7%, up 20 basis points from the prior year. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by productivity improvements partially offset by strategic growth investments. For full year 2015, adjusted operating income increased 2% and adjusting operating margin was 15%, up 10 basis points from the prior year. So with that, I'd like to review the details of our 2016 guidance. Consistent with our usual practice, our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures. As a result, it does not include the impact of our recently announced Affymetrix acquisition, which we expect to close by the end of Q2. We will update our guidance after that deal closes. As Marc mentioned, we're initiating a 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range of $7.80 to $7.96, which represents growth of 6% to 8% over our 2015 adjusted EPS of $7.39. In terms of revenue, our guidance range is $17.36 billion to $17.56 billion, which represents growth of about 2.5% to 3.5% versus our reported revenue of $16.97 billion in 2015. On an organic basis, our revenue range assumes an organic growth midpoint of about 4%. As Marc mentioned, we're seeing another year of negative impact on both the top and bottom line as a result of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus major foreign currencies. As always, we're focused on our reported numbers, but I thought I'd give you a bit more color on the foreign exchange to give you some perspective on how it's impacting our guidance. On the top line, foreign exchange is lowering our revenue by approximately $290 million, which equates to just under a 2% revenue headwind. Foreign currency is reducing our adjusted EPS growth by $0.19, or just over 2.5%. If you were to look at our 2015 guidance or our 2016 guidance on an FX-neutral basis, adjusted EPS growth would be in the range of 8% to 10%, which represents another strong year of underlying operating performance. Consistent with past practice, our guidance assumes current foreign currency exchange rates, and we haven't attempted to forecast future changes in rates. Moving on to the details of our guidance, acquisitions completed in 2015 are expected to contribute about $100 million or 60 basis points to our reported revenue growth in 2016. Giving some color on our assumptions on growth by end market, starting with pharma and biotech, we expect strong performance in this market \u2013 in that market in 2016, and assume mid to high single-digit growth over our very strong low teens growth in 2015. In academic and government, with a better funding environment in the U.S., we expect growth in this end market to improve around the company average. And we expect growth in diagnostics and healthcare to be slightly better in 2016 as well, also growing around the company average. And in industrial and applied, we don't expect any improvement year over year, with growth remaining flat to 2015. Turning to adjusted operating margins, we're expecting around 60 to 70 basis points of expansion year over year. Strong productivity and acquisition synergies will be partially offset by strategic growth investments and the impact of foreign exchange. I will walk you through each of these elements of our margin expansion. So starting with productivity. Here we will continue to use the proven productivity levers of our PPI Business System, including pricing, volume leverage, global sourcing and footprint optimization. These will continue to have a very positive impact on our margin profile. In terms of synergies from the Life Technologies acquisition, we expect to deliver $55 million of year-over-year cost synergy benefit in 2016, and we expect to realize a further $60 million of revenue synergies, which will yield approximately $20 million of adjusted operating income benefit. This will enable us to deliver the three-year goal of $350 million of total cost and revenue synergies in 2016. During the year, we will continue to make strategic investments to continue to drive growth, enhance the impact of innovation, and to improve our customer experience. It was good to see the repeal of the medical device tax in the recently approved federal budget. Unfortunately, it's only repealed for two years, not eliminated entirely. However, as Marc mentioned, we're going to take advantage of this opportunity and plan to reinvest the approximately $15 million of annual impact of the repeal back into the business. The majority will go towards accelerating our long-term productivity initiatives to help counteract some of the impact that foreign exchange has had on our operating margins. In terms of pull-through on the foreign exchange headwind, we're expecting an unfavorable impact on the bottom line totaling $90 million or 30% average margin. This creates 10 basis points of adjusted operating margin dilution. If you were to look at our 2016 adjusted operating margin guidance on an FX-neutral basis, our margin expansion would be 70 basis points to 80 basis points. We will continue to look for ways to minimize the impact of foreign exchange on our P&L. Moving below the line, we expect net interest expense to be in the range of $370 million to $380 million, about $10 million lower than 2015, primarily as a result of the debt reduction actions taken in 2015. For 2016, we are assuming that we will refinance our debt as it matures; we are not planning any further pay down of debt during the year. We're expecting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14%, slightly higher than 2015. And in terms of capital deployment, we're assuming that we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends. The guidance assumes a total of $500 million of share buybacks in 2016, which we've already completed in January. There is no other capital deployment assumed in this guidance. Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 401 million to 402 million, down slightly from 2015 with the impact of the buybacks offsetting option dilution. We're assuming net capital expenditures to be approximately $440 million. And finally, in terms of full year 2016 free cash flow, we're expecting between $2.68 \u2013 we are expecting about $2.68 billion, up $260 million compared to 2015. As a final note from guidance, I wanted to highlight the calendar timing within 2016. Our Q1 2016 fiscal calendar has four more days than Q1 2015. And our Q4 2016 fiscal calendar has four less days than Q4 2015, with no net overall impact for the year. As you know, we do not give quarterly guidance, but given the scale of the days difference, I thought it would be helpful to give you some insight on what we are expecting for Q1 2016. With about 4% organic growth for the full year 2016, we're assuming about 7% growth in Q1. In terms of margin expansion, because we have four extra days of costs in Q1 2016, we are assuming that margins will be flat versus Q1 2015. As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view on how we see things playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets as well as foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the rest of the year. So in summary, we're pleased to deliver a strong finish to the year, and that positions us well to achieve our financial goals for 2016. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now conduct the question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. So, I think we're all a little bit surprised that the EPS guidance is a little bit lower for 2016 than we had anticipated. I guess \u2013 I mean, Stephen, you went through a number of the ones, I think where our model was off. I think we had the share count was a little higher and the interest expense was a little bit higher, I think, sort of giving the biggest hits there. But can you just talk a little bit more about sort of like the mix impacts? If I remember correctly from the old Invitrogen, Life days, as that business sort of picks up, it has a much bigger impact in terms of the hit to the gross margin on that business from FX. I guess, can you talk a little bit more about sort of like mix dynamics, how that's playing out and sort of \u2013 you obviously are seeing stronger strength in the LPS business, and just sort of walk through what's going on and just sort of how you're thinking about sort of the product mix here and how much of that is impacting the business? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Derik, I'll start and then Stephen will add to it. So, thanks for the question. There's $0.19 of FX headwind in the 2016 numbers, right? So, that's actually what the big thing that needs to be understood, right? There was $0.06 incremental after our guidance in the fourth quarter that we drove past and actually beat. So when you take it, 6% to 8% is our guidance for the year; on an FX-neutral basis, it's 8% to 10%. And obviously, it's only assuming the $500 million of capital deployment, which is the buybacks we already did in 2016. Obviously, we're going to get the benefit of Affymetrix later in the year. And we obviously have tremendous amount of capacity to do other things. We just don't want to decide exactly what we're going to do, sitting here, at the end of January, but there are things that we will do to drive more but we wanted to provide absolute clarity of very strong underlying operating performance, big FX headwind that we're working our way through and lots of balance sheet opportunity down the road. Stephen, anything you want to talk about on mix? Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, mix, no, nothing unusual in the mix side that's driving anything positive or negative in 2016. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And just one quick follow-up question. When you sort of look at the end markets, what are sort of your expectations in terms of China and Latin America and sort of how does that flow into 2016? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So from a geographic perspective, we executed very well in China during the course of last year. We clearly gained share from everything that we've heard from others. And we're expecting China to be one of our fastest-growing markets, probably low-double-digit type growth. It's hard to predict exactly but it will be a nice contributor to our growth for this year. For Latin America, Brazil was very soft last year. It's not a huge market for us and we're not assuming any improvement in our numbers. You can see it when Stephen was talking about rest of world. That's primarily Latin America declined a little bit last year and we're assuming a similar type environment. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. I'll get back in the queue. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Derik. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Hi. Good morning, guys. So, I guess as you guys were sort of staring at the consensus estimates and the $8 to $8.18 range, and you guys were contemplating where the guidance was and you were feeling where there were pushes and pulls in the P&L and where the Street had sort of gotten it wrong. I mean I guess what was sort of the internal debate around what you could push forward, whether or not \u2013 Affy [Affymetrix], which obviously pushed off some cap allocation, e.g., you could have done more buyback, had you not done that and that may have helped, I guess, versus the range but longer term may not have been the right decision. I guess, what were some of the key debate points? And then from a messaging perspective, do you feel like you kind of outlined enough for us to have figured this out more so than we did or do you think it really, with some of the macro moves, whether it was FX, et cetera, in the back half of the year, that stuff was moving around too much and it was difficult to sort of message? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Ross, great question. There was no debate. We run the company to do the right thing for our shareholders and for our customers. We don't sit there and say that the consensus is right or wrong. We say what is great operating performance and great use of our capital to create shareholder value. So literally, there was zero debate. We look at what's out there externally. I mean that's why you heard longer remarks today, to really provide clarity on how we're thinking about the world. I think the things that I would take away so that you can look to the future is, one, when we started out 2015 and you looked at our guidance range, we said the following : we would do all of our best without damaging the bright future that the company has to offset the FX headwinds. Last year, we picked up 2% incremental EPS headwinds after our original guidance. We offset all of it and we're able to deliver the high end of our original guidance. When we look at this year, we have a number of actions that we're taking to chip away that FX, but which is why Stephen and I talked a little bit about, we don't just stop. We're actually taking other actions that ensure that if we continue to live in a tough FX environment, that 2017 will also be a fantastic year for the company. So, we're very proactively managing the business. In terms of the capital deployment, hey, we spent \u2013 committed $1.8 billion in the, what, first two weeks of the year. I think we're being pretty aggressive. And it doesn't matter which month these different things happen. We're using our competitive position to create value for shareholders. So, we have incredibly bright prospects and I know that the analysts will look at the numbers and feel good about them. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : So, when you think about \u2013 obviously, again, this is a tough macro, so clearly the underlying ex FX is pretty good growth. Where do you see the biggest pushes and pulls just from an economic perspective in terms of some of the volatility? Obviously, we've looked at what's happened to the biotech sector and people worry about funding. There's been, obviously, the industrial side, some dislocations in parts of the world. FX movements have been a big deal. When you look at where the pushes and pulls are in the guide where you can really have on a top line basis sort of a differentiated outcome, where do you see the most sensitivity, I guess? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, so, Ross, so if you think about last year, we entered the year with a challenging environment. We delivered our strongest organic growth of 5% in a long time, right? And delivered it very solidly despite the fact that not every end market was robust. When we think about this year, we're assuming, as we did last year, we'll finish with about 4%. That's what we're targeting, but if we can do better we will. And if I think about the environment, one, academic and government, a little bit better than last year because of NIH funding. So we're expecting to be at the company average, which is better than the low-single digits last year. Diagnostics and healthcare, we're also expecting to be at the company average or about the company average, which is a little bit better than last year. The big swing factor is going to be biopharma. And it's not going to be the end market conditions; it's just going to be, we had a teens growth or low-double-digit growth last year and we're assuming from a starting point that we're going to grow mid- to high-single digits against the tough comps. So, that's the swing factor on the upside to it. And the team has done a good job over the last five years, six years, seven years of executing in that segment, and we'll keep you posted on how we do. So, I think it gives you good sense of how we're thinking about the world. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Great. Thanks. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ross. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. A question on the restructuring initiatives you talked about. If you look at kind of what's going on in the industrial world, all these companies are taking pretty aggressive restructuring actions. Can you maybe talk about whether this is the first of potentially several steps, whether you think you're doing enough with this initial step, and how you came to kind of the magnitude of the initial restructuring? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Our business is growing 5% organically, so we're not in restructuring mode. What we're doing is saying we want to ensure we're going to drive strong profitability growth for the long term and there are things that we can do that have good paybacks but cost a bunch of money up front in terms of optimizing facilities and you have double costs, those kinds of things. So, we're getting them underway now so that when those things are put into place, basically in 2017, you get a further tailwind on restructuring. We've managed this company through multiple recessions. Both Stephen and I have been here 15 years, right? But right now, end markets are good. Bookings were very strong, right? So if something happens that slows growth down, we know how to take the actions to drive short-term profit growth to deal with a tough environment. But we ended the year with our best quarter in many years and very strong bookings. So, we're just doing the prudent things to drive earnings growth and we'll monitor the end markets very, very closely. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then on capital deployment, as you get back in the back half of the year, should we think about maybe more emphasis on buybacks in light of the multiples you're seeing from an M&A standpoint right now? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: What I would say is that we have a significant capacity to deploy, and we will look at what is the right thing for the shareholder base as the months unfold this year, whether it's more buybacks or more M&A opportunities. We're evaluating the different choices. We got a good M&A pipeline. We have an attractive stock. So, you'll see us continue to be active as the year unfolds. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Then, last one for Stephen. Can you just quantify the extra day impact? Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : The extra day impact in Q4? Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Correct. Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I'm sure it contributed to the overall number, but it's not a significant part of the growth. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Tycho. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. I'm going to do my best to try to put words in your mouth. As I listen to the commentary around the strength of the order funnel, the commentary around end market outlooks for 2016, it sounds like the one growth consideration that might drive a bit of incremental slowing is a normal and appropriate degree of caution around pharma, just because the comps are simply tough, no signal of slowing in the order funnel. So as I look at the model and I say, okay, there's a guide for 7% organic in the first quarter, 4% for the full year, it implies some slowing over the balance of the year. I want to say that's just because we're taking a conservative view on how pharma plays out here in the early days of the year. Is that the right way to think about it? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Steve, everything is accurate up until the calendarization issue. So we're being prudent on the full year guidance, because we have a tough comparison in biopharma. Our aspirations, of course, will be high, and we'll keep you posted. The layout for the calendarization is we literally have almost a full extra week in Q1 and obviously a full \u2013 almost a full less week in Q4. So from a modeling perspective, roughly 7% in the first quarter, and obviously a bigger offset in Q4, kind of still gets to the 4%. So we are actually assuming kind of level activity, and the calendar just leads you to 7% in the first quarter. So don't read into anything beyond that. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And an extra week historically has generated maybe 2 points, 3 points of incremental growth \u2013 is that a fair number? Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : The last time we had an extra week, we were coming off one of the worst recessions ever. So I don't think there's a norm when it comes to it, so we feel good at this point with \u2013 about 7% for Q1. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just one housekeeping question for me. I wonder if you could put numbers around some of the items that we're thinking about on the P&L for this year. I mean, we have got a little bit of a tailwind from the NIH, maybe that's a couple pennies. The R&D credit you called out, and \u2013 I'm sorry, the medtech tax you called out, the R&D credit I know was passed, and we have that for 2016. Could you quantify any of these for us? Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Well, the medical device tax grossed about $15 million, and as we said, we're going to reinvest that. The R&D tax credit is about $23 million impact and that's in both years. So, there's no year-over-year impact, and NIH is part of the organic growth that we outlined in terms of the tailwind. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, organic growth, so a way to think about that one, Steve, would be for the company, it should be about 30 basis points of growth tailwind organically. Roughly a little more than a point in the academic and government end markets. So when you saw us being low single-digits last year, and about the company average this year, that really reflects the improved NIH funding. So hopefully that frames that up pretty well. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks so much. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, guys. Thanks. I wanted to ask a question about your 2016 guidance, as it relates to gross margin. I don't think you guys gave a lot of color on what you're expecting there. But as I look at the fourth quarter performance, obviously, LPS had a great result, and that tends to be your lowest-margin division. So as I think about what you're looking for for this year, should we assume that out-performance in LPS could weigh a little bit on gross margin and accordingly drop through to EPS as well? I'm just trying to square up the other questions on the 2016 EPS guide. Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. So I'm expecting a slight improvement in gross margins year over year in aggregate, and then the rest of the expansion comes from SG&A. So in terms of mix, I'm not expecting a dramatic change in mix the way that we're assuming that these things play out over the coming year. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. So if I had to kind of deconstruct the delta between sell side 2016, kind of consensus EPS and your guidance, it looks like it's mostly FX, and then maybe to a lesser extent share repurchase? Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I \u2013 I don't know. I don't know what you are modeling, so we gave you \u2013 we gave the detailed guidance of what we are assuming in our model. So - Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Right, but assuming you guys have a view on what consensus numbers we're looking at, I just want to make sure I understood the sources of the delta. Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Honestly, I have no idea what people are assuming for foreign exchange. The estimates give a top line and give an EPS number, and I don't see any detail there. So I can tell you what we have assumed in our model going forward. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Right. Right, no. I got the FX guidance. Thanks a bunch. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from UBS. Please go ahead. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks and first of all, congratulations on a strong quarter. I think it was your highest growth rate since first quarter of 2010, if we're right here, so congratulations on that. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : I guess if I'm doing the math, it looks like on your organic growth, plus the life synergies you laid out, the life EBITDA synergies it kind of gives you $0.66 cents or so, and then you're talking about a 2% headwind from FX, you don't include any of the capital deployment. I guess I'm thinking a little bit further out, Marc, if you think about what you laid out at your analyst day on 2018, it sounds like you went out of your way to highlight that you still think the margin target is achievable. Kind of \u2013 what's your view on what you laid out at 2018 as what the EPS could look like? Has that changed at all today? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I mean, obviously, Jon, we'll get into that in May. We've never been concerned, even if we didn't take the actions about the ability to get to the 24 to 26 or drive a very strong performance that we outlined in May, but our goal is not to be at the lower end of that range. Our goal is to be at the higher end of that range, right? So we're taking the actions now to put us higher, you know, higher up in those ranges. So, when I think about last year, one of the things we got tremendously positive feedback was talking about philosophy and the philosophy of how we're dealing with FX, and I think what you're getting today is we're telling about you the philosophy that we \u2013 when we laid out our commitments in May, the world looks different, and we sort of don't care. We're going to navigate through it and deliver outstanding short and long-term financial performance and hence while picking a small point around a $15 million investment, I think it gives you the sense of the philosophy that we're very proactive in managing the business to deliver a really great financial performance. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, it looks like, one, just to clarify, it looks like you're not going to provide book-to-bill anymore and then what are your pricing expectations for 2016? Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, so, actually, Jon, so I didn't give book-to-bill information. It's just not that relevant a metric for the company now, where we have over 75% recurring revenue stream. So, yes, for a large instruments business, it's a relevant metric. For us, it's \u2013 we just don't see it as that relevant. I didn't include it in my script and we don't include it in the recon package. Just so you know what the number is, it's actually slightly positive, 0.5% for Q4. So \u2013 but as I said, it's just not that relevant of a metric for us. And then in terms of your second question \u2013 I've completely forgotten what your second question was. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Just in terms of pricing benefit you expect in 2016. Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. So, I think about the underlying pricing environment hasn't really changed from what we're seeing of our end markets from the last \u2013 really the last sort of three years or four years including this year. Now what we did in 2015 was drive some FX offset actions with some additional targeted price actions which brought our pricing number up. And we'll get a little bit of carryover from that, so pricing year over year in 2016, it will be very similar to 2015, so just over half a percent of price, but underlying, I don't think the pricing dynamics are significantly different in the industry. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Jon. So, operator, we have time for one more. Operator : Certainly, your last question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays, please go ahead. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I'm curious for the fourth quarter we have now seen a few years where the fourth quarter was seasonally stronger. I guess I'm curious what your view was on budget flushes toward the end of the year, what was sort of true growth in the fourth quarter and what might have \u2013 what we can be expecting in terms of the first quarter, whether there are some moving parts there. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Jack, good question. So, the way the world is playing out over the last few years is that customers generally are being conservative early in the year, and I don't mean just one quarter but literally in first three quarters of the year, to deal with, you know, kind of unexpected adverse events whether they are macroeconomic or geopolitical. So we are seeing it across a wide range of customers where there's a conservatism. And as the year unfolds, and bad things really haven't happened, there's a much stronger year-end money, and we were very well positioned to capture it. Our team did a great job. When we look at the first quarter, because customers do a lot of activity late in the year, their demand is going to be a little bit softer but it's been a little bit softer in each of the previous few quarters. So I think as Stephen laid out the outlook for the year, that reflects the fact that customers start out conservatively and then build their spend as the year goes on. So I think we have that well characterized. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then just one follow-up similar to that, the academic segment, specifically, just given the NIH budget getting wrapped up toward year-end. What is your view? I think historically, it's been more the visibility around funding than the actual rate of growth itself. Just curious around the pace of some of that new funding going to work, what your expectations are for 2016. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so obviously, it's good news that our customers know that they can have better budgets. We think that some of that will be in Q1, but more likely Q2, Q3 is where you'll see the strength on the NIH-derived spending in terms of how the year will play out. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So let me wrap it up. We are very pleased to deliver another solid year. We're obviously looking forward to continuing that momentum in 2016, and, of course, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thank you, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

(Broker) Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Thermo Fisher Scientific 2016 first quarter conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note, this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, ThermoFisher.com, under the heading Webcasts & Presentations until May 13, 2016. A copy of the press release of our first quarter 2016 earnings and future expectations is available on the Investors section of the website under the heading Financial Results.

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased you could join us today for our Q1 call. As you saw in our press release, we're off to a strong start to the year. We delivered excellent growth in both revenue and adjusted EPS. Our great top and bottom line performance was the result of a few key factors : good growth across all of our major geographies, strong operational execution by our team, plus the added revenue benefit of four extra days in the quarter. We said last quarter that we expected to come out of the gate strong, and we did. In addition to great operational execution in Q1, we were also very active in capital deployment. We completed $1 billion of stock buybacks in the quarter, and we also closed on our acquisition of Affymetrix at the end of March, which was a quarter sooner than we originally planned. We're excited about the new opportunities we'll have with those added capabilities, and I'll talk a bit more about that later. I'll follow our usual format this morning, starting with the financial results and some commentary on our performance by end market. Then I'll cover a few of the business highlights from the quarter, provide an update on capital deployment, and wrap up with our revised guidance outlook. So starting with the financials. Revenue in Q1 grew 10% to $4.29 billion. Adjusted operating income was up 9%. In terms of our earnings performance, we continued our long track record of consistently delivering strong adjusted EPS, with a 10% increase to $1.80 per share. Let me give you a high-level view of our Q1 performance in the context of our end markets. After a strong year-end finish, we've typically seen a weaker start in Q1, but that was obviously not the case this year, even if you normalize for the four extra days we had versus last year. In our key end markets, pharma and biotech was our strongest again this quarter, as it has been for some time. This was driven by excellent growth in our bioproduction, biopharma services, and biosciences businesses. Healthcare and diagnostics grew around the company average. Academic and government was slightly below the company average, and performance overall in industrial and applied remained muted, with continued weakness in industrial end markets and ongoing strength in applied. In aggregate, the dynamics across our end markets were good, with no material change from what we saw in 2015. Our strong results in Q1 reinforced that our scale and depth of capabilities are clear differentiators across our end markets. Let me now highlight some of our key accomplishments from the quarter, which show that we continue to position Thermo Fisher for an even stronger future. As you know, our growth strategy is based on developing high-impact, innovative new products, leveraging our scale in Asia-Pacific and emerging markets, and delivering our unique customer value proposition to gain share. So starting with innovation, we kicked off the year as we always do, with a strong showing at Pittcon, which you know is a major event in the U.S. for the analytical instruments industry. Over the past couple of years, Pittcon has really evolved into an opportunity for us to showcase our Thermo Scientific technologies for applied markets. Let me give you two quick examples, first in our mass spectrometry business, then in chromatography. In mass spec, we've been adapting the advanced capabilities of our Orbitrap platform for customers working outside the research lab, in applications such as food safety, forensic toxicology, and sports doping. Our recently launched Q Exactive Orbitrap GC-MS/MS is a great example of how we've combined gas chromatography with our Orbitrap capabilities so customers can perform a comprehensive sample analysis in a single run. In our chromatography business, the big headline at Pittcon this year was our new Integrion system, a real breakthrough in high-pressure ion chromatography. It gives customers working in busy environmental, food and beverage, and pharmaceutical laboratories a flexible system for creating highly efficient and accurate work flows. Integrion significantly raises the bar on productivity and performance in applied markets. It was nice to learn that our new ion chromatography portfolio was recognized at the show as the Instrument of the Year by readers of SelectScience magazine. This was a great endorsement by our customers and speaks to the strength of this business. I'll make one more comment on innovation, because it's a great example of how we innovate to fulfill our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer. We all know about the Zika virus, because it's been in the news a lot lately. As you'd expect, when Zika first broke out, we quickly mobilized our teams to begin working with government labs in Brazil, as well as the CDC in the U.S. Our Life Science Solutions business has been developing a qPCR-based test to detect the virus, which is currently undergoing a validation process. We're also offering an immunoassay in the U.S. for research use in partnership with the diagnostics company EUROIMMUN, and we've already begun selling this through our channel business. This is a good example of how we're seen by our customers as a thought leader who can help them solve these pressing issues. In terms of emerging markets, our second growth driver, let me first say that we saw good growth across all our key geographies in Q1, with strong performance in North America and Europe, as well as very strong performance in Asia-Pacific and emerging markets. The standout contributors were China and India, and I'll give you a little more color on what we saw in those regions during the quarter. Starting with India, our commercial teams there are doing an outstanding job of capturing growth opportunities in biopharma, healthcare, and food safety markets. In China, we performed very well in Q1. Our key focus markets, biopharma, healthcare, and environmental, remain robust. As you know, the new five-year plan was announced in March. And much of it is a continuation of the goals set forth in the previous plan, which is great for Thermo Fisher. The plan outlines investments in innovation, healthcare, and the environment. And given the industry-leading presence we've built in China, we continue to be well-positioned in this important growth market. In terms of our customer value proposition, the third element of our growth strategy, you could think of our approach here in two parts. First, we continue to enhance our offering for our customers to make our value proposition even stronger. And, second, we're focused on strengthening our commercial capabilities to best leverage our scale and depth of capabilities. Let me give you an example of each from the quarter. We enhanced our customer offering by completing our acquisition of Affymetrix at the end of March for $1.3 billion. It was great to be out with the team in Santa Clara for the day one activities, and we're excited about the opportunities we have to leverage our complementary offerings. To remind you, Affymetrix is now part of our Life Science Solutions segment. The business has a strong position in flow cytometry and antibodies, which will strengthen our biosciences offering. Its innovative microarray technologies will also open up new growth avenues for us in genetic sciences, particularly in reproductive health and ag bio. This transaction also offers attractive financial benefits. We expect to generate $70 million of operating income synergies by year three following the close : $55 million from cost and $15 million from revenue. So good financial returns, and a hand-in-glove fit with our Life Science Solutions business. The next example I want to share is the investment we've made in our ecommerce capabilities to help our customers take full advantage of our comprehensive portfolio. As I've mentioned in the past, when we acquire a business, we always look to adopt best practices that will make our company even stronger. When we acquired Life Technologies, we gained a gold standard ecommerce platform. We've since moved our Thermo Scientific products to that platform. Now our customers can go to one website for our entire self-manufactured offering, which features rich scientific content, and we'll continue to enhance it with added ecommerce functionality over time. The new website complements our FisherSci.com website, where customers can order our products, as well as those from third-party suppliers. We think of our web presence at a highly valuable tool for driving incremental revenue, and we're pleased with our progress to date. Before I cover our guidance, I'll make a quick comment on capital deployment. As you know, we have an excellent track record of creating shareholder value through our capital deployment strategy, and it's been an active first quarter. We mentioned on our last call that we had already bought back $500 million of shares in January. As you saw in our press release, we bought back an additional $500 million of shares later in the quarter as well. So including our stock buybacks, the dividend, and strategic M&A, we've deployed $2.4 billion of capital so far this year. Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2016. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. Stephen will get into the details, but at a high level, the increased guidance is driven by four factors : the completion of the Affymetrix acquisition in late March, a less adverse foreign exchange environment, the additional $500 million of stock buybacks, and stronger operational performance by our team. Based on these factors, we're raising our revenue guidance for the year to a new range of $17.86 billion to $18.04 billion. This would result in 5% to 6% growth over 2015. We're also raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $8.05 to $8.19 for strong growth of 9% to 11% year over year. Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me sum up my remarks with a couple of takeaways. We started the year with excellent top and bottom line performance. We closed the acquisition of Affymetrix, and we're excited about the new capabilities it brings. We're performing very well in all key geographies and have many opportunities across our businesses to gain share. All of this positions us to achieve another strong year. With that, I'll now hand the call over to Stephen. Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter financial performance for the total company, then I'll provide some color on the four segments and conclude with our updated 2016 guidance. So starting with the overall financial performance for Q1. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 10% to $1.80. GAAP EPS was $1.01, up 5% from Q1 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 10% year over year. The Q1 reported revenue includes 10% organic growth, 1% growth from acquisitions, and a 2% headwind from foreign exchange. Please note, the components of the Q1 change do not sum due to rounding. As I mentioned on the last earnings call, the way our fiscal calendar falls in 2016, we have four extra billing days in Q1, and four less in Q4. We estimate that we received just under a 5% benefit to our organic growth in Q1 from the impact of days, the consumables revenue getting most of the impact of the extra days, while the capital equipment revenue was only marginally affected. We expect to see the opposite effect on revenue in Q4, when we have four less billing days, but there's no impact on the year as a whole. So normalizing Q1, minus the extra days, we estimate that our organic growth was approximately 5% during the quarter. Looking at growth by geography in Q1, I'll provide some color based on the 5% normalized organic growth to provide you with an understanding of the relative performance by region. Based on that, North America and Europe grew in the mid-single digits. Asia-Pacific grew in the high single digits with another strong contribution from China, and rest of the world, which represents less than 5% of our revenues, declined in the high single digits. Looking at our operational performance, Q1 adjusted operating income increased 9%, and adjusted operating margin was 21.7%, down 20 basis points from Q1 of last year. Our margin performance in Q1 was in line with our expectations. We received good expansion from our organic growth, driven by strong contributions from our PPI business system and the benefit of acquisition cost synergies, but this is more than offset by a 30 basis point negative impact from the extra calendar days and a 30 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. The impact of the extra days on margins is not that intuitive, so I thought it would be helpful to take a minute to summarize it for you. There were 66 billing days in Q1 2016 versus 62 in Q1 2015, a 6.5% increase. As I mentioned earlier, this had a positive impact on organic growth of approximately 5%. However, since the level of cost is directly correlated to the number of days, the impact on costs was the full 6.5%. So that means our costs went up more than our revenue because of the days impact. The net effect on this, on our operating margin, is the headwind of approximately 30 basis points in Q1 that I just mentioned. It's important to note there'll be a corresponding positive impact to margins in Q4 when we have four less billing days. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.2% in Q1, down 110 basis points from the prior year. The decrease in gross margin in Q1 is primarily attributed to headwinds from unfavorable business mix, the impact of four extra days, and foreign exchange. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 22.4% of revenue, which is 80 basis points favorable to Q1 2015, and R&D expense came in at 4.1% of revenue, down 10 basis points versus Q1 last year. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q1 was 6.4%. Looking at results below the line, net interest expense was $95 million, down $6 million from Q1 last year, mainly as a result of lower average debt levels. Adjusted other income and expense was negative $1 million, which is $8 million lower than 2015, driven primarily by changes in non-operating foreign exchange. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14%, flat to last year, and average diluted shares were $398.7 million, down $2.7 million year over year, mainly as a result of the share buybacks completed in Q1, partially offset by option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations through Q1 was $290 million, and free cash flow was $180 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $110 million. Free cash flow was $195 million favorable to Q1 2015. We ended the quarter with $830 million in cash and investments, and we also returned significant capital to shareholders during the quarter. On our Q4 call, I mentioned we'd already completed the $500 million in share buybacks in January. We also bought an incremental $500 million later in the quarter for a total of $1 billion in buybacks during Q1. As I'm sure you're all aware, we deployed $1.3 billion to acquire Affymetrix right at the end of Q1. And we also returned $60 million to shareholders during the quarter through our dividend. So all in all, as Marc mentioned, we deployed $2.4 billion of capital in Q1. Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $15 billion, up $2.5 billion sequentially from Q4, mainly driven by the increase in short-term debt relating to the acquisition of Affymetrix and the share buyback. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.5 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA. And wrapping up my comments on total company performance, ROIC improved in the quarter. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC at the end of Q1 was 9.6%, up 10 basis points sequentially from Q4. So with that, I'll provide you with some color on the performance of our four business segments. As I highlighted for the total company, foreign exchange continued to be a headwind for the top line for our segments and impacted their year-over-year revenue growth and adjusted operating margin to varying degrees. The four extra calendar days impacted segment revenue and margins to varying degrees as well. So starting with Life Science Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 11% in Q1, and organic revenue also grew 11%. In the quarter, we continued to see strong growth in our bioproduction, biosciences, and next-gen sequencing businesses. Q1 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions increase 10%, and adjusted operating margin was 29.1%, down 20 basis points year over year. Operating margin was positively affected by volume pull-through, strong productivity, and the impact of days. But this was more than offset by unfavorable business mix, strategic investments, and unfavorable foreign exchange. In the Analytical Instrument segment, reported revenue increased 4% in Q1, and organic revenue growth was 6%. In the quarter, we had strong growth in our chromatography and services businesses, partially offset by continued weakness in some of our core industrial markets. Q1 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments decreased 8%, and adjusted operating margin was 14.7%, down 200 basis points year over year. Strong productivity was more than offset by the impact of the extra days in the quarter, as well as the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and strategic investments. The days impact was very material for this segment, approximately 200 basis points. Given the low consumables mix in the segment, the extra days had little impact on the top line, but they had the full impact on the cost base, causing significant margin compression. This will reverse in Q4, when we have four less days. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q1, total revenue grew 9%, and organic revenue growth was 10%. This was driven by solid growth across all our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income increased 7% in Q1, and adjusted operating margin was 26.9%, down 40 basis points from the prior year. Operating margin was positively impacted by good productivity and volume pull-through, but this was more than offset by strategic investments, unfavorable business mix and unfavorable foreign exchange. Finally, in the Lab Products and Services segment, Q1 reported revenue increased 14%, and organic revenue growth was also 14%. This segment continues to benefit from our strong performance in the pharma and biotech end market, with our biopharma services, research and safety market channel and Lab Products businesses all delivering very strong growth. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 16%, and adjusted operating margin was 15%, up 30 basis points from the prior year. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by volume pull-through and good productivity, with partial offsets from strategic investments and the headwind of the additional days in the quarter. We'll now review the details of our full-year 2016 guidance. As you saw in the press release, I'm pleased to report significant increases in both our top and bottom line guidance. The improved guidance is due to several factors : the acquisition of Affymetrix, more favorable foreign exchange rates relative to our prior guidance, additional stock buybacks completed in Q1, and stronger operational performance. I'll take you through the impact of each of these four items in turn. The first change related to guidance reflects the acquisition of Affymetrix. We expect this to deliver $275 million of revenue and $40 million of adjusted operating income over the remaining nine months of the year, and that includes our synergies. So in all, that will translate to $0.06 of adjusted earnings per share in 2016. The accretion impact of Affymetrix is very back-end loaded, given the phasing of their revenue and the strong ramp of synergies towards the end of the year. Affymetrix is dilutive to the total-company operating margin in 2016 by approximately 10 basis points. The second change to guidance relates to foreign exchange. We've increased our guidance to reflect a less adverse FX environment, increasing revenue by $200 million and adjusted earnings per share by $0.11. As you know, we've seen tremendous amount of volatility in FX rates this year, so we used an average of rates over the past couple of months for our revised guidance. Our revised 2016 guidance now assumes a year-over-year FX headwind of $90 million of revenue, $32 million of adjusted operating income, and $0.075 of adjusted earnings per share. So still a headwind for the year, but much lower than our initial guidance. The third change to guidance reflects the impact of the stock buybacks we completed in Q1. In total, we bought back $1 billion of stock in Q1. Half of this was already in our initial guidance, so the revised guidance includes an additional $0.06 for the second $500 million of buybacks we completed in the quarter. The fourth change to guidance reflects improved operational performance. Given the strong start to the year, we're raising the low end of revenue guidance by $25 million and raising the low end of adjusted EPS guidance by $0.02. So to sum all this up, the revised 2016 revenue guidance range is $17.86 billion to $18.04 billion, which would represent 5% to 6% growth versus 2015. The $490 million increase to the midpoint comes from three factors : $275 million related to Affymetrix, $200 million from an improved foreign exchange environment, and $15 million of higher organic growth. We're still expecting to deliver organic growth of about 4% for the full year, consistent with our previous guidance. In terms of phasing for the remainder of the year, given the days impact and the strong comp from last year, we expect Q4 organic growth to be essentially flat. And, as a reminder, the organic growth comp in Q2 is more challenging than the organic growth comp in Q3. Acquisitions are now expected to contribute about 2% to our reported revenue growth in 2016, and FX is expected to be a 0.5% headwind. In terms of our adjusted EPS, our revised guidance range is $8.05 to $8.19 and represents growth of 9% to 11% over our 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $7.39, with a 1% headwind from foreign exchange. To bridge the $0.24 increase in the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance, we gain $0.11 from the more favorable foreign exchange, $0.06 from Affymetrix, $0.06 from the additional Q1 share buyback, and $0.01 from operational improvements. A few other details behind the revised 2016 guidance. We are now expecting 50 to 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year over year, and this includes the 10 basis points dilution from Affymetrix. We're expecting net interest expense to be about $390 million versus the $380 million in our previous guidance as a result of the incremental debt relating to the Affymetrix acquisition. We're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14%, consistent with our previous guidance. In terms of capital deployment, we're still assuming we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends. Our guidance does not include any future acquisitions, divestitures, or stock buybacks. This is consistent with our past practice of not forecasting incremental capital deployments beyond dividends. Full-year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of $398 million to $399 million, down about $3 million from our previous guidance as a result of the stock buybacks we completed in Q1. And we're expecting net capital expenditure to be approximately $440 million, up slightly from the previous guidance, due to the Affymetrix acquisition. In terms of free cash flow for 2016, we now expect this to be about $2.72 billion, slightly higher than the prior guidance, due to the increase in our earnings outlook related to FX and our operational performance. There is no net free cash flow impact in 2016 from adding Affymetrix, as the operating cash flow for the nine months is offset by the cost of achieved synergies, deal fees, and the capital expenditures related to the business. In Q1, we used short-term borrowing for the acquisition of Affymetrix and the stock buybacks. Absent any other need, our intent is to pay this down during the course of the year with the cash flow we generate from operations. As always in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view of how we see results playing out. So in summary we had a number of significant achievements this quarter while delivering solid operational results, which positions us really well to achieve our financial goals for the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Stephen. Jessa, we're ready to open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the helpful color. I guess, Marc, as we think about the end markets, where do you feel like you guys are sort of over-punching in terms of gaining share, more so? Because it looks like when we line up your growth rates versus your peer group \u2013 and obviously that's hard \u2013 it does feel on a like-for-like basis, you moved from growing in line-ish to now above the comp group. And so just help us feel for where \u2013 what market, specifically, you feel like maybe you're sort of outperforming? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Ross, good morning, thanks for the question. You know, when I look at the lens from an end market, I'd say pharma and biotech continues to be a huge strength for the company. As you know, we have a very strong competitive position because of our scale and our unique depth of capabilities. We have great relations with all of our pharma and biotech customers, and that's positioned us to do well. That end market was stronger than our expectations in the quarter also, so we were able to deliver very positive growth there. So that's an end market look. If you take another lens on the same question, which is more of a product look or a business segment look, it's an area we pay a lot of attention to. Very strong start to the year. And all my comments on this is really normalizing for the days as well so that you're getting a kind of apples-to-apples look. You know, our Lab Products business and our channel business, very strong performance. Certainly our bioproduction business not only benefits from a really good end market, but the business is performing extraordinarily well. So that clearly has been above-market growth. Our chromatography and mass spec business, that combined business, had a very strong start to the year as well. So those would be some examples where you take a product lens looking at that and say, how are we doing? That's a nice cut on products, and by the end markets, pharma, biotech, and finally China. Geographically, we're growing very, very strong, continuing the strength there. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : And maybe just following up on that. It feels like the emerging markets, you guys have done a tremendous job. China is continuing on its trajectory, and India, I think, as well has had reasonable demand. Can you just give us a picture? Seemed like that is certainly better than rest of world. What's your thought on how the various high-growth markets kind of pace throughout the rest of the year? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, when I think about the high-level comments there, China has been, for a number of years, our strongest growing market for the company of any significant market, and we continue to be very positive on the outlook for not only the short term, but for the mid- and long-term as well. India is performing well. Reasonable performance in Southeast Asia and Korea. Obviously, real pockets of weakness in Brazil and Russia, and those are very small markets for us. In aggregate, together, I think the two of them represent about 1% of our revenue, so it's not material. So it's always a portfolio. The good news is that the big ones are doing well and the ones that are very small have weakness. And you take a long-term view, those markets too will turn better, but certainly not a 2016 factor. Thank you, Ross. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Ross. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Jack Meehan from Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to start and ask about the Lab Products and Services. Even adjusting for the days in the quarter it continues to do a lot better than we would think. Can you maybe just talk about the channel? You mentioned some of the new ecommerce capabilities. Do you think you're taking a little bit more share? Are there any changes in pricing? What are you seeing there? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jack, thanks for the question and good morning. In terms of Lab Products and Services business, you look back over the last number of quarters, we've delivered very strong growth. And that's been a blend of first, our biopharma services business, or our clinical trials and outsourcing business, where we don't really have much in the way of external competition. You have \u2013 the customer choice is primarily do you do it in house or do you outsource to us. And that business has performed very well for a long period of time, and that trend continued again in the first quarter. The channel business also has been doing well, really benefiting from strong demand in the biotech and pharmaceutical customer base. So that business has been a strong performer, and our self-manufacturing business within that segment, Lab Products, also did very well, where we're the largest provider of lab consumables and lap equipment in the world. That also is benefiting from strong biotech and pharmaceutical end markets. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then just one on academic to follow up. Just curious whether you're starting to see anything through the NIH just yet, and maybe just your visibility? I think the growth in the quarter, you mentioned, was a little bit below company average. For the full year, do you still think it's more in line? Thanks. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jack, in terms of academic and government, what we're seeing there has been consistent with the last few quarters. Adjusted for \u2013 normalizing for days, it would be low single-digit growth. If you don't normalize for days, it would just be under the company average. We continue to be encouraged by the more favorable environment in the U.S., right? So U.S. improved in Q1, so you're starting to see the release of NIH funds, and that should continue in Q2 and Q3. So that's really been a positive, and it should be a reasonable end market from our perspective. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Marc, we got a lot of questions on the tax rate, just obviously, given some of the things that were going on with the Pfizer-Allergan deal, and some of the things coming out of Washington. And I know the low tax rate of the company has always been one of the things that people have always asked questions about Thermo. So can you walk us through does the changes that are going on have any impact in the company, number one? And then, how sustainable is the 14% tax rate? And how should we think about that over the next few years? Thanks. Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, good morning, Derik; I'll take the question. So obviously we pay very close attention to the tax regulations and changes there, and there's regulations across the world as well as domestically, and we have a great tax team. Recently, the Treasury Department laid out kind of two new tax regulations. One set of regulations is very concentrated to reduce the impact, the benefit of inversions. And those just simply don't apply to the company. The second set of regulations were targeted at limiting U.S. companies' ability to tax-efficiently repatriate cash from overseas. And when I think about that impact on our company, our existing tax structures, which aren't impacted by these regulations, provide pretty substantial cash repatriation capacity in a very tax-efficient way. So, at this point, I don't see any material impact from the regulatory changes on the company for the foreseeable future. So bottom line is we're comfortable with the tax rate and the corporate tax planning strategies that we have in place across the company. When I think about the tax rate going forward, we'll probably talk more about this at the Analyst Day. Just to remind you, the messaging form last year is the tax rate \u2013 the earnings that accrete going forward over and above the earnings we have today generally come in at a higher marginal tax rate than the 14% that we have in place on average for the company. So, absent any other changes in terms of our structuring, the tax rate will creep up slightly. We've done a pretty good job of making sure that that doesn't happen over time. If you look back over the past three years, I think we've effectively navigated through that. Part of that comes from some structures that we can put in place with acquisitions that we do. But the rest of it really comes from just good management of our tax strategies and just thinking about the different regulatory changes. So more to come at the Analyst Day, but that's kind of a recap on how we've seen it for the last couple of years. Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, that was very thorough. Thanks for the overview. I'll get back in the queue. Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Derik. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, guys. First question was on just a little bit more geographic color. I think you gave us a general sense of how things played out globally, but was curious if you could offer a growth rate in China and in Europe. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, so in terms of the growth rates, you had strong double-digit growth in China, and when you adjust that for the days, it's going to be in the teens. When you look at Europe, it grew pretty much in line with the company average in terms of growth. So it was a good, good, solid quarter in Europe as well. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, that's helpful. And then, maybe Stephen, a follow-up on margins. Appreciate all your comments regarding the puts and takes in the first quarter, and some of the corresponding benefits in the fourth quarter. But if we kind of look away from that, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on just PPI. I know that's an ongoing focus for the company every year, and I was wondering if you could talk to a little bit about what the key initiatives are this year. And just looking for some color on the underlying efforts you guys are making to improve margins. Thank you. Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure, so yeah, think about the PPI drivers of productivity. It's a group of levers that we use and have continually used since I've been at the company. And it's kind of a combination of \u2013 larger type of restructurings where you're consolidating the footprints of the organization in terms of the manufacturing operations and the back office. It's also the micro aspect of PPI. So we're \u2013 day in, day out, we're just being better at leaning out the operations and the back office functions and kind of the way that we work. So the combination of all of that is a continual set of efforts. So there's nothing \u2013 no major shift in terms of low-cost region plays that we're doing, the footprint optimization, and the use of sourcing and pricing levers. Those are kind of continuing. But the one new thing this year, as I said on the last earnings call, is that we're looking to reinvest the benefit of the medical device tax into some longer-term projects. And one \u2013 a set of projects around the footprint and more complex footprint changes in terms of manufacturing, and then being more efficient in our financial back office. Those projects are underway and are progressing well. So I think it's just a continuum in terms of the impact of the PPI business system, and then we're kind of stepping it up a little bit in terms of using the opportunity to reinvest the medical device tax. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you. Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. Maybe just first question on biopharma. I know in your initial guidance, Marc, for the year, I think you'd kind of factored in a 600 basis point, 700 basis point headwind just from the tough comp. Maybe just \u2013 can you think about what you think the growth trajectory looks like for that segment for the rest of the year? And are there kind of larger strategic deals out there that you're looking at as well in the biopharma business, particularly around bioprocess and bioproduction? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So, Tycho, thank you for the question. In terms of the end market, we had our easiest comparison in the first quarter. So we had a very strong start, better than we expected. As you look at the outlook for the rest of the year, we expect that the growth will continue to still be very strong, but a little bit less robust rate than what we saw in the first quarter, in terms of the biopharma end market. But it'll be our fastest-growing market for the year; that's our expectation. In terms of strategic M&A, we have a really good M&A pipeline. Bolt-ons primarily, but we consider many different transactions, and if the right ones line up, you'll see us be active. So that's kind of the normal course for us. We're always thinking about and taking actions to strengthen the company's competitive position. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then in Stephen's comments by division, he mentioned strategic investments for each of the different segments. Can you maybe just talk from a higher level where you're placing more incremental investment this year? Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So it's the usual areas around improving our commercial capabilities in some specific areas, particularly around service infrastructure, as well as some specific R&D new products introduction and product launch-type of investments. So it's \u2013 the growth areas for the top line are what we're focused on. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Tycho. Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from UBS. Please go ahead. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, good morning, and congratulations on a solid start to the year. So, Marc, I guess \u2013 you've answered a lot of end market questions, so I'm going to steer away from some of those. I think we get the sense as to what's changed the EPS and the impact from some of what you're seeing operationally. So I want to focus on maybe two quick things. One, on Affymetrix, can you maybe talk a little bit about how you're \u2013 a little bit more about how you're thinking of integrating that asset, and what could drive upside to the accretion that you've talked about? I know you distribute some products from Affymetrix. To me, it's always looked a little bit more like a product line. Seemed like there could be a lot of G&A overlap. So can you maybe just talk a little bit about what might drive upside to your accretion targets? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So, Jon, we're really excited to have the business as part of Thermo Fisher and have welcomed our new colleagues. And they're not only running the business well but actively looking at how do you maximize the impact with our customer base and the competitive position? I'd break it into two different themes. One is a product theme, and one is a geographic theme. The geographic theme is quite easy, right? Where we'll be looking for upside is really the commercial reach around the world. Thermo Fisher has incredible reach, and Affymetrix was a much narrower company, so that will help over time, focusing on accelerating growth and capturing revenue synergies. And over time, we'll obviously drive to the upside to the most extent possible. From a product fit, the reason the acquisition is so compelling is really the way you framed it. Which is, it was a whole company, but really it is two great product lines that fit so incredibly tightly with our Life Science Solutions business, and we're able to combine our flow cytometry and antibody businesses and the biosciences business, which gives us a much stronger competitive position. And we're able to add the micro-array technologies to our large genetic sciences business, which really puts us in a very unique position, because we will be truly technology agnostic for solving customers' problems, because we will be the only company that has next-gen sequencing, Sanger sequencing, microarrays, and qPCR with leading positions across that array of technology. So that a customer will say, here's the challenge I have, and we will give them the optimal work flow. And these are very complementary fits. So with good execution we'll obviously focus on delivering what we committed to, and then always looking for the upside. So \u2013 from an accretion perspective, as we announced when we announced the deal in January, we see the $0.10 in the first full year, which translates to basically $0.06 this year, $0.04 in Q1 of 2017. But, as you know, as time unfolds we'll be looking for opportunities to drive to the upside. That's probably more of a 2017 benefit than a 2016 benefit. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. I've gone back over your comments, Marc, maybe over the last couple years. Two categories you consistently call out have been, in terms of growth, have been chromatography and actually also NGS. You're a huge company, so I'm guessing if you're calling those out, they must be particularly strong growers. Would you be willing to kind of size those businesses for us today, kind of relatively, how big they are? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The specifics doesn't matter as much, but the next-gen sequencing business is approximately a couple percent of revenue. And the chromatography business, kind of order of magnitude, just shy of $1 billion, it's a little under that. So NGS is a small business growing rapidly. Chromatography is a pretty-good sized business growing rapidly. And that really, to me, I like the chromatography business, because what you saw was Thermo Fisher, years ago, having a strong niche position, Dionex having a strong niche position. The combination is a very strong business, and the two businesses together are growing faster than what the individual businesses were growing as standalones. So that's the kinds of capabilities that Thermo Fisher Scientific brings when we combine businesses because of the very strong advantages we have from scale and depth of capabilities. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I really wanted to just try to cover two topics. One is Specialty Diagnostics; the other is innovation. So, starting on Specialty Diagnostics. This has been an area where you guys have underperformed relative to the corporate average and I think everybody's expectations, including yours, for several quarters. This quarter you did really, really well. Can you help us think about how we should think about the underlying growth rate of Specialty Diagnostics moving ahead? And are there some investments being made in Specialty Diagnostics that are driving better performance? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, in terms of Specialty Diagnostics, we are investing very significantly in areas that will create a brighter future for the growth rates in that business, right? And they don't have a big short-term impact. Very large programs in the next-gen sequencing area. Very large programs in mass spectrometry. Obviously they're driving some level of growth, but they really are positioning for the long term, right? So that's one thing, which is why, when we take a long-term perspective on the business, we're very, very bullish and optimistic about the long-term growth prospects there. In terms of the performance of the business in the quarter, a better quarter strength across really all of the businesses within the portfolio. The seasonal businesses really were no effect one way or the other, so there was no special causes. And we didn't have to talk about OEM contract and all that other stuff that was \u2013 again, had a lot of talk, but in the scheme of things wasn't that material. So it was a reasonable quarter, and really we're taking the actions to make sure that in the long term that business is a good, fast-growing business for us. Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, Doug, I don't want to take any shine off a good quarter, but just to remind you that the organic growth that I gave in my script around the segments were the reported organic growth and not the days adjusted. Days adjusted is still good in that segment, so it's about the company average. So I'd just try and remind everybody that those percentages I gave out are non-days adjusted for the segments. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. All right, that's all very helpful. And I guess on the innovation topic, and some of this ties into what you described in terms of your longer-term investments or your investments in longer-term opportunities within Specialty Diagnostics, Marc. In reading your proxy, I won't read the exact language, but you noted that the percentage of 2015 revenue attributable from products commercialized in the last two years was down relative to what you saw in 2014. And relatedly you had appointed a new CSO. Can you provide a bit more detail on what changes you're making to improve this metric over the next few years? And does the strength you're seeing early in the year afford you an opportunity to maybe invest more pursuant to improving this metric? Thank you. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Doug, that's a great question. So one of the things in the metric, which is kind of fun, which is we use a very short window on momentum. So the metric was down slightly year over year, and that's primarily because the Orbitrap, one of the Orbitrap derivatives that had unbelievable success, which still has that same great momentum, came off the two-year anniversary, so they don't consider it a new product, right? So you have the ebbs and flows on the metric. When I look at the dollars of products that we're deriving from \u2013 dollars of revenue \u2013 that number's been pretty solid for the company. The actions we're taking to create an even brighter future from innovation, we have a great Chief Scientific Officer and a very strong team, and you'll get that \u2013 a little bit of a highlight of some of the things we're working on at the analyst meeting in less than a month's time. So reserve the date. I'm sure Ken has sent that out. It's the best day in New York of the year, as I know \u2013 at least from my perspective. And so you'll get a sense of it, but we're very confident about the investments we're making. And in fact, two weeks ago, I was out with 300 of our leading scientists at the company, at a symposium we were doing, where they were actually working on new business ideas and new technology ideas, leveraging the strengths of the company. And I came away just so unbelievably energized by some of the things our teams are working on. We have incredible talent within R&D. So (53:24). Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: One question on the balance between consumables and instruments. It's a little difficult, given the relative impact of the selling days issued here in the quarter, to look at on an organic basis how consumables are tracking relative to instruments. Maybe not necessarily for the quarter, but on a trailing two- or three-quarter basis. Could you give us a sense for how consumables are tracking relative to instruments? And historically, as cycles have strengthened, you might have seen a few more points of strength early on in instruments. Is that happening here? And if we see more consumable strength going forward, what does that mean on a relative basis for the potential for margin expansion? Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So I'll start. When I think about the instruments business, and you look at it, very little revenue effect from days. About 6% organic growth in the quarter, in terms of how the instruments business did. Which, when you peel that back, you have a large chemical analysis business serving some very weak sectors of the industrial market, and then a very large chromatography and mass-spectrometry business. So, when you think of that level of growth, it's very strong performance, and that's been like, that bifurcation of weak industrial, weak chemical analysis, very strong life sciences, mass spec, and chromatography, has been a continuation trend. So that business is good. From the consumables mix \u2013 and pretty steady on good performance, right? Our channel business has done well; Life Science Solutions has done well. When I think about profitability, it's not a huge driver. We make a little bit more money on consumables for the self-manufactured portion, but embedded in there is the channel business. So, as you know, we don't manage the mix that way, but generally I'm not concerned by sort of the rates of growth in the businesses. In fact, the consumable growth shows that we have pretty steady, stable performance in the end markets. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just one clarification. Can you remind us in the outlook for the year, to what extent you've incorporated expectations for stronger trends on the NIH in the back half, given the normal 3Q disbursements that one would expect? Thanks. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so we pretty much expected the funds to flow from NIH in the first three quarters. And as you alluded, probably the strongest in Q3. But it should be reasonable in each of those three quarters during the course of this year. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Just one question for Stephen. In terms of the free cash flow, could you help us bridge the gap between the 25% conversion we saw in the first quarter and sort of if there was discrete dynamics weighing on that in the first period? And how we get really from there to what seems to imply about 85% conversion for the full year? Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So it's a dynamic we see pretty much every year. It's very front-end loaded in terms of interest and cash tax payments, as well as we pay bonus \u2013 bonus payouts come out in the first quarter. And then, generally, there's a depletion of working capital, an increase in working capital. And there's a decrease at the end of the year, an increase at the beginning of the year. So it's a pretty similar seasonal dynamic that we've seen play out for the past many, many years. So actually I feel good that we're ahead significantly from last year. We're almost $200 million higher, free cash flow than this point back in Q1 2015. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, that's it. Thanks. Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President- Investor Relations : Jessa, we have time for one more. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah, good morning, thank you. Maybe just a question on pharma from the services side. Can you just talk to growth for Unity in the quarter? And then maybe as a follow-on, Marc, each of the big players there has been doing well for some time now. Just curious how you would characterize the competition these days? Are you bumping into those guys more than in the past? Or is everybody operating in their own sweet spot, so to speak? I think you get the competitive dynamic question pretty often there, but just curious about the runway there as we try to get our hands around the continuation in biopharma strength. Thanks. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So in terms of the services portion of the company. About 14% of our revenue is services, and that's split between our biopharma services or our clinical trial services business and the Unity Lab Services, which is basically a combination of supporting our instruments and equipment and doing some outsourcing of that for our customers as well. Both of those businesses have demonstrated good growth, and growing at or above the company average in terms of performance. And the competitive set on the Unity Lab Services side really hasn't changed much. You have a couple other companies that are in that market. And each have their own strategy. We feel good about our outlook there. Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, let me wrap it up here. Thank you for the interest, and from my perspective, we had a great start to the year, with a great Q1 behind us. We're very well-positioned to deliver a strong 2016. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter and of course, seeing you in New York City in May at our Analyst Day. Thank you, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And welcome to the Thermo Fisher Scientific 2016 Second Quarter Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin. Kenneth Apicerno : Good morning. And thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note, this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts & Presentations until August 26, 2016. A copy of the press release of our second quarter 2016 earnings and future expectations is available on the Investors section of the website under the heading Financial Results.

So with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. We\u2019re pleased you could join us today for our Q2 earnings call. We had another great quarter with strong performance on the top and bottom line. We have a proven growth strategy, our team is executing well, and we continue to strengthen our offerings that help our customers meet their goals. Our result in Q2 contributed to a very good first half of the year. We\u2019re also successfully executing our capital deployment strategy. As you know, a big highlight in the quarter was our agreement to acquire FEI. We\u2019re really excited about the new opportunities this will bring, and I\u2019ll discuss that in more detail later in my remarks. As usual, I\u2019ll start by covering the Q2 financial highlights, give you a little color on our performance by end-markets and provide a recap of the quarter in the context of our growth strategy. Then, I\u2019ll wrap up with our revised guidance. Starting with the financials, revenue in Q2 grew 6% to $4.54 billion. Adjusted operating income was up 9% and our adjusted operating margin increased 50 basis points to 22.8%. Last but most important, we extended our long track record of delivering strong adjusted EPS growth, with a 10% increase to a $2.03 per share. So, with another strong quarter behind us, we\u2019re in a great position at the halfway point of the year. As you know, the global economic environment remains uncertain, but we\u2019re using this as an opportunity to help our customers manage through it, and that will strengthen our competitive position and allow us to continue to gain share. Let me now turn to a high level view of our performance in the context of our key end-markets. If we step back and look at the first half, our strong results were really a combination of good end-markets in aggregate and very good execution. Looking specifically at Q2, we were pleased to see continued strong growth in pharma and biotech, which grew in the high single digits. We\u2019re benefiting from both the underlying strength of this end-market and our ability to successfully deliver our unique proposition to these customers. Growth in our bioproduction business was particularly strong in Q2. In healthcare and diagnostics, we grew at about the Company average, highlighted by strong performance in our ImmunoDiagnostics and next generation sequencing businesses. In academic and government end-markets, we continued to deliver low single-digit growth. And, finally, we saw a continuation of low single-digit growth overall in industrial and applied. As we see for quite a time, industrial markets remain soft and applied markets continue to perform well, with especially strong growth in China and our chromatography business globally. Now, I will cover some of our Q2 business highlights in the context of our growth strategy. As most of you know, we increased our capabilities for our customers and drive growth for our Company by focusing on three strategic pillars, which are : High-impact innovation; scale in emerging markets; and delivering our unique customer value preposition to gain share. So, let me start with innovation where we participated in a number of major conferences in Q2, representing a broad cross-section of our customer base from cancer research to bioproduction, mass spectrometry and applied markets. There are great opportunities for us to demonstrate our leadership and our commitment to our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. I use that as a framework to cover a few of the highlights. First, healthier: We exhibited our leading offering for bioproduction customers at INTERPHEX. In addition to our expanded line of single-use containers, we featured new products from our recent acquisition of ASI such as the ImPULSE single-use mixing system for biotherapeutics. We continue to benefit from strong demand for these technologies as our customers rapidly adopt single-use technology for the production of biologics and vaccines. At ASMS, we launched our new Q Exactive BioPharma mass spectrometer, which we designed specifically to help pharma and biotech customers more efficiently discover and develop new drugs. As these systems become more powerful and data much more plentiful, customers need to better track, manage and share their results, as well as connect and monitor their instruments. We ramped up our efforts to address these rapidly changing needs and also launched a suite of new software and cloud-based solutions at ASMS to support range of applications. So, back to our mission. In terms of enabling a cleaner world, the big event for applied markets in the quarter was analytic test, which has held in Europe. Sustainability is especially important to these customers and a key area of focus for us as well. We featured a range of laboratory equipment design for a cleaner lab including our new TFX ultra-low temperature freezers that use natural refrigerants and reduce energy consumption. We also featured biosafety cabinets that require 75% less energy to operate. Last, a good example of safer is that our Gemini handheld chemical analyzer won the 2016 Edison Award for forensics and security. To remind you, Gemini was the first instrument to integrate Raman and FTIR spectroscopy in the handheld device that can be used by hazmat teams, first responders and military personnel in the field. These are just some of the many examples of how we fulfill our mission by helping our customers meet their goals. Turning to emerging markets, our second pillar of growth, we had another strong quarter in these geographic regions with standout results in China, South Korea, India and Southeast Asia. To mention a couple of highlights, China continues to be a great market for us, and we delivered another strong quarter with growth in the mid-teens. Our businesses across the Company continue to benefit from growth in applied markets such as environmental and food safety as well as life sciences which is expanding into new fields like precision medicine. In June, we announced our partnership with the West China Hospital of Sichuan University to develop a joint platform for advancing research in precision medicine. This is one of the largest single site hospitals in the world, and we\u2019re looking forward to helping our customers there, improve the quality of pathology research and clinical diagnostics. This exciting opportunity underscores the importance of precision medicine as a global initiative and one that was identified as a key priority in China\u2019s new five-year plan. In other emerging markets, robust growth in South Korea was driven by our leading presence in biopharma. It\u2019s also great to see our investments in India paying off with another strong quarter of growth. We had strong performance in Southeast Asia as well. And I was travelling their last month and visited our regional headquarters in Singapore. We continue to expand our centre of excellence in Singapore, which now supports manufacturing of our GC-MS products in addition to our life science solutions instrumentation. This site is a very good example of how we\u2019re leveraging our scale to better serve our customers while improving the overall cost structure of our Company. I\u2019ll make one last comment relative to the third pillar of our growth strategy, which is our unique customer value proposition. I mentioned precision medicine in my recap of China, and I want to give you another example of our efforts here because it illustrates how our scale and depth uniquely position us to play a key role. Precision medicine involves using a patient\u2019s biological information down to the molecular level, to more effectively treat their disease. Cancer is a natural area of focus, and this information is being used to diagnose and treat a patient\u2019s specific type of tumor. We had a significant presence at the American Association for Cancer Research where we featured a range of technologies suited to this important work including CRISPR and siRNA libraries, the iS5 and S5 XL next generation sequencing systems as well as our leading mass spectrometry platforms. Our scientists also led numerous sessions on this topic covering solutions ranging from next gen sequencing to liquid biopsy, qPCR-based pharmacogenomics and targeted mass spectrometry. It\u2019s clear that our customers are committed to finding better ways to treat this terrible disease, and our unmatched capabilities can help them accelerate their progress. Let me switch topics now and turn to capital deployment. We had big news on that front in late May, committing $4.2 billion to acquire FEI. This is a really exciting development, given FEI\u2019s unique strategic fit with our Company and specifically within Analytical Instruments. As you know, we have an exceptional track record of developing Orbitrap mass spectrometry for protein identification and characterization, and it\u2019s been the foundation of our highly successful franchise. FEI\u2019s CryoEM system is also being used in protein research, specifically for the structural analysis of proteins. By combining these technologies of one company, we\u2019ll be in the best position to help our customers capitalize on the rapid growth in structural biology. While FEI made progress moving more into life science applications, our unmatched presence in industry will accelerate adoption with these customers. Since the announcement, I\u2019ve had a chance to interact with quite a few of our future FEI colleagues and it reinforces to me what a great business this is, it\u2019s well-managed, has excellent technologies, and a talented and enthusiastic team. It\u2019s going to be a great addition to our analytical instrument segment and a key growth driver to our Company. Let me also add that we\u2019re making good process towards closing the transaction. We now expect to close by the end of this year, versus our initial estimate of early 2017. The integration from both companies are in place, planning is underway, and we\u2019re very confident in our ability to achieve the $80 million of total synergies we laid out when we announced the transaction. Now, let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2016. As you saw in our press release, we\u2019re updating our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. As usual, Stephen will cover the details and assumptions but in summary, we\u2019re revising guidance based on our strong operating performance for the first half, as well as for the more unfavorable foreign exchange environment. We now expect revenue for the year to be in the range of $17.84 billion to $18.0 billion. This would result in 5% to 6% growth over 2015, in line with our previous guidance. We\u2019re raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $8.07 to $8.20, which is 9% to 11% increase year-over-year. Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize my remarks with a couple of takeaways. We had another strong quarter of financial performance, which contributed to great first half. We\u2019re executing our growth strategy and complementing that with strategic acquisitions like FEI. We\u2019re in an excellent position at the halfway point and on track to achieve our goals for the year. With that, I\u2019ll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc; and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll begin with an overview of our second quarter financial performance for the total Company; then, I\u2019ll provide some color on our four segments; and conclude with an updated 2016 guidance. So, starting with the overall financial performance for Q2, as you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 10% to $2.03. GAAP EPS was $1.30 up 2% through Q2 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 6%, year-over-year. Q2 reported revenue increased 4% organic growth, 3% growth from acquisitions while currency translation decreased revenues slightly. Please note the components of the Q2 change do not sum due to rounding. Given the FX volatility, I thought it\u2019d be helpful to provide a little more color on the impact of foreign exchange in Q2. The revenue impact was a headwind of $16 million, but due to the mix of currency changes, the impact to adjusted operating income was actually a $4 million positive tailwind, resulting in a slight benefit to margins for the quarter and a $0.01 positive impact on adjusted earnings per share. At the very end of the quarter, rates changed significantly, and we\u2019re expecting foreign exchange headwinds on both revenue and adjusted operating income for the remainder of the year. I\u2019ll provide more detail on this later, when I go to the assumptions for our updated guidance. Looking at our growth by geography in Q2, both North America and Europe grew in the low single digits; Asia Pacific grew in the low double digits with continued strong momentum in China, good growth in South Korea, Southeast Asia and India. And the rest of the world declined mid-single-digits. Turning to our operational performance, Q2 adjusted operating income increased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 22.8%, up 50 basis points from Q2 of last year. Looking at the components of our adjusted operating margin performance in Q2, we achieved good margin expansion from our organic growth, driven by robust contributions from our PPI business system, price and volume. As we expected, Affymetrix was a 30 basis-point headwind on margins in Q2, but this was offset by the FX tailwinds that I just mentioned. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total Company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.6% in Q2, up 60 basis points from the prior year. The increase in adjusted gross margin was primarily due to strong productivity, acquisitions and the FX tailwind, partially offset by unfavorable business mix. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 21.8% of revenue, which is up 10 basis points versus Q2 2015. And R&D expense came in at 4% of revenue, down 10 basis points versus Q2 last year. And R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in the quarter was 6.2%. Looking our results below the line, net interest expense was $106 million, up $11 million from Q2 last year, mainly as a result of financing related to capital deployment activities during the quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.5%, which is 50 basis points lower than last year, as a result of our tax planning initiatives. And average diluted shares in the quarter were $396.7 million, down $4.8 million year-over-year, mainly as a result of the share buybacks we completed in Q1, partially offset by stock option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations for the first half of the year was $1.2 billion, and free cash flow was $970 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $210 million. This is $310 million higher than the first half free cash flow in 2015. We ended the quarter with $665 million in cash and investments; and in Q2, we paid $60 million of dividends. As you know, we were very active in deploying capital during the first half of this year. We\u2019ve acquired Affymetrix for $1.3 billion, executed $1 billion of share buybacks in Q1, and distributed about $120 million in shareholder dividends for a total of $2.4 billion in the first half of the year. In addition, we signed an agreement to acquire FEI committing an additional $4.2 billion of capital. Our total debt at the end of Q2 was $14.1 billion, down $900 million sequentially from Q1, as a result of paying down short-term debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA, down from 3.5 times at the end of Q1. And wrapping up my comments on our total Company performance, ROIC continues to improve. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC at the end of Q2 was 9.8%, up 20 basis points sequentially from Q1. So with that, I\u2019ll now provide you with some color on the performance of our four business segments. Starting with the Life Sciences Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 13% in Q2, and organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter, we continued to see very strong momentum in our bioproduction business, and had good growth in our nextgen sequencing and bioscience businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions increased 14%, and adjusted operating margin was 28.9%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was positively impacted by strong productivity and volume pull-through, partially offset by unfavorable business mix, acquisitions, and strategic investments. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 2% in Q2 and organic revenue growth was 3%. In the quarter, we had strong growth contributions from our chromatography and mass spec, and our environmental instruments businesses, partially offset by continued weakness in some of our industrial markets. Q2 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 4% and adjusted operating margin was 18.3%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Very strong productivity, volume leverage and favorable FX were partially offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment, in Q2, reported and organic revenue, both grew 4%. We saw a good growth in the segment, led by the ImmunoDiagnostics business. Adjusted operating income increased 5% in Q2 and adjusted operating margin was 27.9%, up 10 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was driven by productivity, volume leverage, and foreign exchange offset partly by the impact of strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. And finally, in the Lab Products and Services segment, Q2 reported revenue increased 6% and organic revenue growth was 5%. We had good growth across all businesses in the segment. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 8% and adjusted operating margin was 15.5%, up 10 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin expansion in the quarter was driven by productivity and volume pull-through with partial offsets from strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. Now, I\u2019ll review the details of our full year 2016 guidance. There are two primary changes from our previous guidance. First, we\u2019re increasing our guidance based on strong operational performance; and second, we\u2019re factoring in the recent changes in foreign exchange rates. And I\u2019ll take you through each of these in detail. The first is the increase in our operational performance outlook. With the good first half behind us, we\u2019re increasing our expected organic growth for the full year from about 4% to about 4.5%. This increases revenue at the midpoint by $60 million from our previous guidance. The stronger organic growth\u2019s outlook results in additional $0.035 of adjusted earnings per share at the midpoint. Given that we\u2019re one quarter further in the year, we\u2019re also narrowing the range of our revenue guidance from $180 million to $160 million and narrowing our adjusted EPS range from $0.14 to $0.13. The second change relates to the impact of FX. And as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all aware, rates have moved significantly in the past several weeks. Given the continued uncertainty around FX rates, we\u2019ve once again taken a conservative approach to arrive at the FX impact for the year. As a result, the change in FX reduces our revenue guidance for the year by an additional $19 million and reduces our adjusted earnings per share guidance by an additional $0.02. Our 2016 guidance, now assumes the year-over-year FX headwind of $180 million of revenue or 1.1%, $42 million of adjusted operating income, and $0.10 of adjusted earnings per share. In terms of phasing of the $0.10 during the year, we\u2019ve already incurred $0.05 of the headwind year-to-date and we\u2019re assuming $0.03 headwind in Q3 and $0.02 in Q4. So, to sum all this up, the revised 2016 revenue guidance range is $17.84 billion to $18.0 billion, which represents 5% to 6% growth versus 2015, similar to our previous guidance. At the midpoint, revenue is increasing $60 million due to the improved operational performance outlook and decreasing $90 million with additional foreign exchange headwind. In terms of adjusting earnings per share, our increased 2016 guidance range is now $8.07 to $8.20 with a midpoint of $8.135. This represents growth of 9% to 11% versus 2015, also consistent with our previous guidance. Excluding the FX impact, this would represent adjusted earnings per share growth of 10% to 12% for the year. The midpoint of the adjusted earnings per share is increasing $0.015 with the additional $0.02 for foreign exchange headwind being more than offset by the $0.035 of improved operational performance. And we\u2019re now expecting 60 to 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year; this is slightly improved my previous guidance of 50 to 70 basis points, primarily as result of the change in FX. So, given the days impact on our 2016 fiscal calendar, I thought it\u2019d also be helpful to add some more color around phasing. As a reminder, our Q1 had four more days and our Q4 will have four less days in the equivalent quarters in 2015. In Q1 2016, I reported organic growth was 10%, and we estimated the days-adjusted organic growth in that quarter was approximately 5%. As we look to Q4, given the days will be a headwind in that quarter, we\u2019re expecting reported organic growth in Q4 to be essentially flat, consistent with our previous guidance. The days had a positive impact on Q1 and will have corresponding negative impact on Q4 organic growth. Overall, for the year, there is no impact. One final comment about the calendar, as I mentioned on pervious calls, in Q4, we\u2019ll have the benefit of four less days of cost, which we all expect to significantly benefit our adjusted operating margin and earnings in the quarter. So, as you think about the phasing of our adjusted earnings per share in the second half of the year, at the mid-point, we currently view approximately 55% being realized in Q4. A few other details behind the revised 2016 guidance, acquisitions are still expected to contribute about 2% to our reported revenue growth in 2016 and FX is expected to be about 1% headwind. We continue to expect net interest expense to be about $390 million. We\u2019re forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14%, no change from our previous guidance. In terms of capital deployment, we are still assuming we will return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends. And our guidance does not include any future acquisitions, divestitures or stock buybacks. Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be about 398 million, slightly lower than our previous guidance. And we\u2019re expecting net capital expenditure to be approximately $440 million, consistent with previous guidance. And finally we\u2019re expecting about $2.72 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2016; this is also consistent with our previous guidance. As always, in interpreting the revenue and adjusted EPS guidance rages, you should focus on the mid points as the most likely view of how we see the results playing out. So, in summary, we delivered another strong quarter in Q2, which positions us well at the halfway point to achieve our 2016 financial goals. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth Apicerno : Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we\u2019re ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Derik de Bruin : On the Analytical Instruments business, did you just talk a little bit about what the industrial headwinds have been to that business? And also just look back on a broader perspective on the overall Thermo business, can you talk little bit about just what the overall industrial is? And this is going to leading to a question on potential fallout from slowing in Europe as a result of the Brexit and just if you are seeing anything there? Marc Casper : Sure, Derik. Let\u2019s start with the Analytical Instruments. So, there are two business units within that segment, chroma [ph] mass spec continues to grow high single digits and grew that in the quarter. Our chemical analysis, which is really the industrially related business, is declined in the mid single digit. So, when you kind of look at it versus the various kind of sub peers chroma [ph] mass spec continues to do extraordinarily well in the marketplace and chemical analysis is operating like most of the peers are very heavily industrially oriented. Towards the second part of your question, more of the broader Thermo Fisher industrial and applied exposure, about 20% of our revenue is industrial and applied; roughly half of that is applied and half is industrial. Applied markets continue to be strong. As I mentioned in my remarks, China continues to be very good for us. In the industrial markets, we really haven\u2019t seen any inflection point; it\u2019s really been continued soft conditions which we\u2019ve had over the last few years. And then, in terms of Europe and Brexit, really just given how late the UK announcements came in at quarter, really had no impact in terms of the revenue outlook. It obviously had a lot of movement in volatility, and there might have been a little conservatism in the UK spend itself, but nothing significant in the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : I wanted to ask a little bit about China and the underlying drivers there for the mid-teens growth. Could you remind us the rough mix of the end-markets there and just how strong was applied in the quarter? Marc Casper : So, in terms of our China business, in China at the end of last quarter really good strength across the end-markets. The pure industrial continues to be soft but applied markets very good, healthcare was very good in the quarter, as well as big focus on the life sciences area, which is the convergence of historically, life science tools into the diagnostic applications with precision medicine. While we don\u2019t manage our business by the end-markets, we manage by our businesses, what you see is in that particular end-market, applied markets because of the importance of environmental protection and food safety, is much larger as a percent of the total mix than the other markets around the world. So, those markets are good. China continues to deliver very strong growth, and bookings once again exceeded revenue in the quarter and it bodes well for the short-term as well. Jack Meehan : And then, just one follow-up on biopharma high single-digit in the quarter, I caught some of the feedback on bioproduction. Could you just maybe talk about the consumable service, clinical trial logistics, just how some of the other segments within there, performing will be great? Thank you. Marc Casper : Yes. So, in terms of biotech and pharma customers, another strong quarter, because of the benefits of both the good end-market as well as really how well our value proposition resonates. In the quarter, the high single digit growth, it really had the most challenging comparison year-over-year. So, that end-market continues to perform well. Bioproduction was the strongest of the businesses; the consumables channel business had a good quarter there as well as did biosciences. We did get growth in our clinical trials logistics business, a little bit slower growth than the last few quarters, but that was something we anticipated because of very, very strong comparison in Q2. So, the fundamentals there are good and the outlook continues to be strong in the biopharma end-market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson : Marc, maybe to follow up on that last line of question for life science solutions, can you maybe just talk about how much of the outsized performance there is bioprocess versus nextgen sequencing? And on the latter point, are you starting to drive some revenue synergies between what we\u2019re you doing on the sequencing side and what the addition of Affymetrix would raise? Marc Casper : Sure. So, in terms of the life science solutions business, had a very strong quarter, and it really is driven by good performance across the businesses. So, when you look at it, bioproduction had a very strong quarter, biosciences continues to grow well. Our nextgen sequencing business grew very strongly in the teens, and our genetic analysis business had organic growth that was also quite stable across all of its platforms. So, very strong execution across the quarter; obviously, the fastest growing portions are bioproduction and the nextgen sequencing businesses. Tycho Peterson : And then, as a follow-up to go back to Derek\u2019s question earlier on industrial, we have seen I guess more constructive commentary from some of your peers, [indiscernible] had a good quarter, Danaher talked a little bit more positively about a recovery. Can you maybe just talk about when you think you bottom out on the industrial side, and do you expect it to pick up in the back half? Marc Casper : Yes, I would say -- I am not -- while I have an economics degree, I am not an economist, and I\u2019m not going to call the bottom. When I look at the various reports, they were quite mixed, Granger [ph] had very negative outlook, some companies were very positive, specifically about the industrial end-markets. So, I think it\u2019s too early to call a bottom. But, if we see it, obviously that would be clearly a positive upside because we\u2019re not baking in any improvement in the balance of the year. So, if that happens, that clearly would drive us above the organic growth rates that Stephen outlined. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Ross Muken : So, one of your peers this week sort of dropped idea that possibly this CapEx cycle for pharma will look different than prior and that maybe the sort of period will be elongated or we may actually not see sort of a down part of the cycle. And so, I guess as you step back and you think about, obviously you have a more unique view point into a broad base of biopharma, what\u2019s your sort of view on the sustainability of sort of the current trend and what is the pushes and pulls, whether it\u2019s some the emerging market pharma that are growing well, and the level of visibility or your feeling on that relative to maybe time past? Marc Casper : So, you\u2019re clearly seeing an expansion of the biopharma industry in terms of the activity, not necessarily where drugs are consumed, but the activity in the South Koreas, the Chinas of the world. So, I think back over various cycles, they become so small relative to the U.S. and western Europe but more meaningful. So, that\u2019s clearly a positive. We\u2019ve seen good growth there. India has been a good growth driver as well. So, it\u2019s encouraging from kind of longevity. When you look at what\u2019s going on, I think the single biggest driver is that the quality of the research and new entities getting approved, right? And because the funding ultimately is Western Europe and the U.S., and as long as drugs are getting through to the market and demand is strong there, they will be funding that\u2019s very robust in R&D. So, it\u2019s less to me cyclical than right now they are in a sweet spot of the science turning into drugs that\u2019s turning into demand for our products. So, we feel good about it. And the fact, even in what I think is very good end-markets, there is an efficiency driver amongst that customer base, whether it\u2019s small biotech or large pharma, and that plays to our sweet spot for sure. We see it in the results across quarter in and quarter out, the very strong performance in the biopharma customer set for us. So, we feel very well-positioned in a good end-market. Ross Muken : And maybe just, it seems like broadly on the life sciences solution side, you had a good numbers and I\u2019d say generic business did well. What about Affy? Obviously that one, you\u2019ve now seen a little bit in terms of being in the organization, not very long but enough to sort of get your hands around it. How are you feeling about sort of the different components there? And then in general, I think at the Analyst Day, you sort of highlighted the flow business a bit. I mean how are you feeling about that end-market? Marc Casper : Sure. So, let me give you our first read on Affy, we don\u2019t refer basically one quarter. The integration is going extremely well. We continue to be on track to deliver the EPS accretion for 2016 loss that we outlined, which is about $0.06. Synergies are running ahead of schedule in terms of timing on the cost side, so that\u2019s very good. The eBioscience business is performing well; the flow cytometry market looks attractive. Our Attune flow cytometer has good adoption, the revenue synergies there should come out very strong. So, of all that\u2019s very positive. The microarray business is softer than we had seen before. And really what\u2019s going on in microarray is that before the close of the transaction, the primary competitor micro will raise really dramatically drop [ph] price and then Affymetrix as an independent company chose not to follow suit. So, in Q2 we focused the R&D and marketing teams on addressing that competitive dynamic. And in early July, you may have noticed that we launched the Axiom Precision Medicine Research Array. And that\u2019s a broad base genotyping array that\u2019s very valuable in providing interesting information around health questions. And we\u2019re offering that at very attractive price points. So, generally, I feel good about the integration, the synergies, the accretion, and the flow and eBio business. And we are putting some countermeasures in place for microarrays. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Doug Schenkel : My first question is on the academic government end-market. Does your guidance still embed an expectation that U.S. academic government demand picks up with the release of funding in the second half of this calendar year? And in Japan, recognizing others in the group have indicated that academic research demand was pretty weak in Q2, I\u2019m just wondering if this is something you\u2019re seeing as well. Marc Casper : Yes. So, Doug, from an academic and government perspective, as I mentioned, we grew in the low single digits. Q1, we saw a bit of an uptick in the NIH release of funds; Q2 was consistent with that improvement. And we expect the balance of the year kind of being consistent with that. In terms of Japan, we grew low single digits, in line with our expectations in the quarter. Academic was a little bit soft, biopharma was quite good. So, Japan for us continues to be not particularly noteworthy; it\u2019s not a very big end-market and generally performing in line with expectations. Doug Schenkel : Okay. And just one quick cleanup question. In terms of share repurchases, you did put an additional authorization in place over the last two months or so, doesn\u2019t seem like there is any change in share count assumptions embedded into guidance. So, should we think that you\u2019ve an incremental share reauthorization or larger share authorization to purchase more shares in place now but that\u2019s something that\u2019s probably not going to be acted on until you get into next year and closer to the closing of the FEI M&A closure? Marc Casper : Yes, I think that\u2019s good observation and good assumptions. Effectively -- generally, we like to have an open authorization in place. And we used up the authorization when we did our share buybacks earlier in the year. The 1.5 billion just reflects kind of consistent with our long-term capital deployments strategy; I wanted to have a little bit larger authorization. But, given how active we\u2019ve been in capital deployment in the first half of the year, we don\u2019t have any immediate plans to use it. It\u2019s more just the housekeeping to have that in place to be opportunistic and consistent with our long-term capital deployment strategy. Doug Schenkel : Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you. Marc Casper : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg from UBS. Please go ahead. Jonathan Groberg : Marc, at the very macro level or the high level, the quarter seems solid [ph] with a lot of moving products, it seems very much in line, not a lot of changes to your guidance. Can you maybe help us think through, as you went through the quarter, anything that was particularly noteworthy to you that maybe -- again, when it all rolled up to the top, it doesn\u2019t seem particular -- nothing really stands out but is there anything that you think that was particularly noteworthy or positive that we should be aware of? Marc Casper : Yes, I wish it was a video conference, so I have a big smile on my face. This was actually an excellent quarter, Jon. When I think about it, many of you have heard me saying is generally, I don\u2019t like to have investors have to really think about Thermo Fisher in terms of any of the nuances because it\u2019s our job to manage through the various puts and takes in the economy. We executed very well. Effectively we were able to raise our organic growth outlook for the full year, based on the half. We don\u2019t typically raise organic growth guidance during the course of the year; we typically are more focused on the EPS, so we did both, which is I think is great. When you look at the geographic strength, we went out of the way to highlight the strength in four different end markets in Asia Pacific that really is doing very well, which bodes well for the second half, given the fact that there is clearly some volatility in Europe that -- an uncertainty in Europe that we don\u2019t know, nobody knows exactly how that will play out. But given how the U.S. is doing and given how Asia Pacific is doing, we\u2019re very well-positioned to have an outstanding year. Capital deployment has gone well; margins were good. So, I like the fact that there is really not a tremendous amount of nuances. It\u2019s a very clean ahead of expectations quarter and our ability to offset the FX headwinds that are there and raise guidance. And then, finally, as Stephen said in this remarks, we are a bit conservative on the outlook on foreign exchange in our guidance. And if foreign exchange stays exactly as they close on the spot rates, we actually have a little bit of upside to the guidance there. But given the volatility, we don\u2019t think it was prudent to put that in. So, really, a very good time at the halfway point of the year. Jonathan Groberg : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And as a quick follow-up to that Marc, if you think about the second half, as you mentioned you have the UK decision; you have the politics going on in the U.S.; you have the China precision medicine initiative, which seems to be really kicking up. I guess are you kind of handicapping your second half outlook? Marc Casper : So, the way we\u2019re thinking about it is the outlook in the second half in aggregate is similar to the very original guidance we gave at the start of the year for the second half. So effectively, first half was better than we expected, we put it all in the bank, raised our organic outlook, we\u2019re assuming consistent with our original guidance for the second half of the year. Geographically, probably it will be slightly different, meaning that it\u2019s likely to be Asia Pacific and U.S. a little better than Europe, but we have enough room to achieve our goals even with some up and downs in the various end markets. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro : First, a question on one product specific item and then, second on the financials. Marc, you mentioned you don\u2019t want to get too into the [indiscernible] products, but I was curious on your NGS comments, hoping to put that in context with the performing in OSS [ph] in total, just kind of curious how significant that was. And maybe curious to the extent that hat business has been doing maybe better over the last couple of years than you might have expected; is it really a function of still growing the install base or is it really about the consumables pulling through a lot of utilization on the install base you have? Marc Casper : Isaac, I appreciate the question. And the reason I would say that I won\u2019t get too much into the details of the products is that we have such a broad range of products and really it\u2019s how we manage the portfolio. But I am happy to get into the NGS discussion. We had a very good quarter. The adoption of S5 and S5 XL sequencers going really well, the feedback is very positive and customers love the ease of installation and the ease of use of the instruments, and it\u2019s fantastic feedback. The other thing that was exciting and may not be as clear, but at the European Association of Cancer Research conference, we were the first company to bring to market, a kit for liquid biopsy for cancer. And that was very well received as well. So, consumable is doing well, our product development is going well, and option of instrumentation is going well in the quarter. Isaac Ro : And then, Steve, a question on tax rate; you guys have still maintained that 14% number; it was a little better than that this quarter. So, I\u2019m wondering, if we should assume an uptick in the back half or is there a possibility that you guys could -- if the geographic mix plays out, if you could feel upside to that tax rate, in terms of better tax rate? Stephen Williamson : So, we\u2019re still guiding to 14% for the full year. I see that\u2019s where it will end up, given what I can see now in terms of the desecrate items. The lower tax rate in Q2 was really due to the timing of some of the discrete tax planning activities coming in stronger in Q2. I expect that to continue in Q3, so similar tax rate in Q3 versus Q2 and slightly high in Q4, but overall for the year, 14%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Steve Beuchaw : Marc, if I look at the growth rate in China in the quarter, on the one hand, it\u2019s clearly a very good number, but then when I consider the comp and how tough it was, it\u2019s actually the best quarter, growth wise you\u2019ve had in China in I believe at least a few years. So, I wonder, given that context if you could refresh your thoughts the impact of some of the initiative we\u2019re seeing China, as much as they relate, not so much to what we\u2019re seeing here in 2016, but a medium term outlook there, now that you\u2019ve got a little bit more evidence? And then, just one housekeeping question for Stephen. Sorry, if I missed it, but did you refresh any thinking on the free cash flow or working capital outlook for the year? Stephen Williamson : I\u2019ll start with the second question on free cash flow. So, we didn\u2019t change the guidance; it\u2019s still $2.72 billion. At the half year point, we\u2019re actually doing very well, so $310 million higher than the same half year point last year, and that\u2019s where some phasing of cash taxes and cash interest, more front end-loaded this year. So, working capital is going well, still got six months to go. If we continue the way we are, we will meet or exceed the full year cash flow guidance. Marc Casper : And Steve, you\u2019re 100% right, the stack comparison, was the best performance in China in a while. So, as you know, we\u2019ve been positive on China for a very long time. And when we came out of the one soft year where we had the mid single digit organic growth couple of years ago, what you\u2019re seeing is a consistent trend of improvement. And when I -- my takeaways from my visit was, precision medicine will be a forward-looking driver but the focus on environmental, food safety as well as healthcare expansion is very positive. When I was there, I had the opportunity to meet with of the Vice Minister of Ministry of Science, and really talked about precision medicine. And that is a huge focus. So, we continue to be very bullish on the long term prospect for China. Operator : Your next question is from the line Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Steve Willoughby : I have two questions, first for Stephen. If you could just kind of walk me through a little bit what you -- how you are thinking about FX. And it was my understanding that you are largely naturally hedged in the UK. And then I was thinking you should be getting some benefit from the stronger yen. So, what\u2019s the offset that\u2019s pulling back things a bit as it relates to EPS for FX? Stephen Williamson : Sure. So, when you look at the currencies we have overall and the year-over-year change at this point, the yen is a positive, and that\u2019s helping the overall picture for full year FX impact. Majority of the revenue headwinds, about 75% of it is coming from that change in the pound. And then the mix of all the other currencies pretty much negative against the dollar at this point. So, the mix of all of that basically gets you to where we are. Now, as I said in my prepared remarks, we have a cushion against the current spot rate. So, if current rate still stand, we\u2019ll have some upside to the guidance that we give. Yen is a positive but it\u2019s really offset by the other pretty every single other currency. Steve Willoughby : Okay, it makes sense. And then, just secondly, within the LSS business, it\u2019s been a number of quarters now in a row where you guys are showing strong growth there. I was wondering, Marc, if you could comment at all on how much of that is end-market versus revenue synergies you might be experiencing with the Life Tech business? Marc Casper : So, revenue synergies are very strong. And if I think about the performance there -- it\u2019s really embedded in the organic growth at this point, given where we are, how long it\u2019s been close to transaction. But we achieved the revenue synergies for the full year -- we had uptick of $60 million of revenue synergies; we achieved that on the first half, meaning that we will far exceed the revenue synergy number. And if you\u2019ll ask about tracking, it\u2019s showing up in the organic growth. So that obviously continues to be a big benefit. As I\u2019ve said other times, probably one point of the aggregate performance of the step up in Life Sciences Solutions is the end market is better than it was at the time we announced the transaction in 2013. And the rest has been just really good execution by the team, and the unique benefits that Thermo Fisher Scientifics reach brought to that business segment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Daniel Arias : Maybe just two quick ones on the outlook, Marc, tying out the end market commentary on industrials with the softness that you are still seeing there, is flattish still the right way to think about things for the year? And then, Stephen, what at this point are you looking for in terms of the FX impact to gross margins for the year? Marc Casper : In terms of industrial and applied, while, we don\u2019t give a precise outlook during the course of the year, flattish to low single digits is a good assumption for the industrial and applied markets for the year. In terms of the FX\u2026 Stephen Williamson : Basically, I\u2019m not expecting a significant impact on gross margins or operating margins for the full year the way the rates are today. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Please go ahead. Paul Knight : Hey, Marc, your internet strategy is obviously helping drive organic growth in your pricing ability. Can you talk about the investments you are making there and talk about where you are with your ability to price and even to discount? Marc Casper : Yes. So, first on pricing, another good quarter, in aggregate, about 60 basis points of price. We\u2019ll look towards the change in currency rates that we saw at the end of the quarter, should create some incremental pricing opportunities. Whether that will flow this year or flow into next year hard to tell but that should be additional pricing opportunity. In terms of e-commerce, it\u2019s been a really positive driver for the Company. As everybody knows, we have integrated down to two web platforms, our fishersci platform and our Thermo Fisher Scientific platform. And when you look at that, we continue to enable more products on the Thermo Fisher platform to be available on e-commerce. We took the old backbone from Life Technologies, we\u2019ve been adding and recorded now -- adding new capabilities and new products that are available for purchase online. And that\u2019s really good from a customer convenience, stickiness and ultimately growth, and growth in profitability. Paul Knight : And Marc without the metrics, any estimate on your part as to how much of an increase in their addressable customers they have with their microarray and their reagent business, is it you can open up the doors to 50% more customers, 25%, what are your thoughts there? Marc Casper : The way I would think about it, Paul, is for the flow cytometry business and the antibody business, we really have an exquisite reach around the world, and that\u2019s going to be a very big expansion opportunity. In terms of the microarray, they were well-penetrated in the U.S. and Europe, and we will be able to expand the Asia Pacific presence where we have very strong presence in genetic analysis. Asia Pacific probably represents say 20% of the world opportunity, they obviously cover the bigger hospitals and the bigger research customers but it should be a nice expansion within that. Paul Knight : Thank you. Marc Casper : Operator, we\u2019re going to take just one more. Operator : Thank you. Your last question comes from the line of Sung Ji Nam from Avondale Partners. Please go ahead. Sung Ji Nam : I just have one question. Marc, maybe if you could talk about the bioproduction business, obviously strength across the industry over the last number of quarters. And I was curious as to is the key driver essentially the number of new molecules entering the market or are there kind of other drivers like single-use technology kind of being the bigger driver or maybe if you could just talk about other drivers as well? Marc Casper : Yes, Sung Ji, thanks for the question. So, bioproduction market continues to be very strong. We have the leadership position in both cell culture and in the single-use technologies, which is two of the four verticals within that market. We\u2019re seeing strong demand from drugs getting on market where volume really picks up. The number of drugs actually in the process development stage also is a big consumption of demand. Vaccine production and the increase in vaccines is a big driver of demand. And then, on top of all of that, for existing approaches, there has been a very large shift from stainless steel to single-use, and that also accentuates the good growth in the market. So that\u2019s been an excellent growth market for a number of years for us and one with a very bright future. So with that, let me bring the call to a close with a couple of quick comments. First, thank you for participating. We had a really strong excellent first half, that\u2019s behind us; we\u2019re very well-positioned to deliver another strong year. And of course, we look forward to updating you on our progress in the third quarter. Thanks everyone. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our Q3 earnings call. We're pleased to tell you that we had another great quarter and we're right where we should be at this point of the year. We delivered strong financial performance on the top and bottom lines. We continued to execute our growth strategy to best serve our customers and gain share. And we also completed our acquisition of FEI earlier than we expected, and the integration process is in full swing. So terrific progress across the board. I'll cover these points in more details in a few moments. But the key message is that with three great quarters behind us, we're well positioned to deliver another very successful year. I'll start by covering the Q3 financials at a high level, give you some color on our performance by end market, and provide a recap of the quarterly highlights in the context of our growth strategy. Then I'll wrap up with our revised guidance. In terms of financials, revenue in Q3 grew 9% to $4.49 billion. Adjusted operating income was up 11% and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 40 basis points to 23%. Finally, I'm very pleased that we achieved a 13% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.03. As you know, adjusted EPS is our primary performance metric and we continue to deliver consistently strong results to extend our long track record here. In summary, it was a great quarter financially and our teams are really executing well to take advantage of the opportunities we have to help our customers meet their goals. As you hear from us every quarter, we're committed to building on our capabilities to being an even stronger partner for them whether we're launching new products or making strategic acquisitions. The global environment obviously has its challenges, but we look at them as opportunities to help our customers be successful, and we're effectively leveraging our unique value proposition to gain share and drive growth. That's a good segue into our end market discussion. There's been a lot of commentary on the various end market dynamics. Let me provide some color on what we saw on the four end markets in Q3. In aggregate, our key end markets were in line with our expectations, and Q3 was similar to what we saw in Q2. At a high level, two of our end markets were essentially the same : academic and government and health care and diagnostics. And the other two changed a little. Pharma and biotech was a bit stronger, and industrial and applied was a bit weaker. I'll give you a few more details about each one. In pharma and biotech, we grew in the low-double digits in Q3. The market dynamics remained very healthy and we continued to effectively leverage our depth of capabilities to gain share with these customers. Growth in our bioproduction and biopharma services businesses were particularly strong in the quarter, and we also had strong performance here in our chromatography and mass spec business. Academic and government end markets grew slightly in the quarter, and industrial and applied end markets declined slightly. And in health care and diagnostics, our growth overall was similar to last quarter. This was highlighted by strong performance in our transplant diagnostic business and particularly strong growth in our clinical next-gen sequencing business. So, again, not much difference in our end markets overall compared with Q2. Now, I'll cover some of our Q3 business highlights in the context of our growth strategy. As you know, we continue to follow a clear and consistent strategy to strengthen our position in targeted end markets and geographic regions. We're focused on developing high impact innovative new products, expanding our scale in Asia Pacific and emerging markets, and enhancing our unique customer value proposition. I'll start with innovation as I usually do. We launched a number of new products during the quarter across our businesses, but I'd like to focus my remarks today on a few examples of how we're increasing our depth of capabilities for customers working in the clinic. Late July marked the annual meeting of the American Association of Clinical Chemistry. We showcased a number of assays, instruments and software under our Thermo Scientific Premier brand. So let me highlight a few of them. First, we were pleased to be cleared by the U.S. FDA to expand the use of our leading BRAMS PCT sepsis test. It can now be used in the emergency room or other medical wards before a patient is admitted to the ICU. Our PCT test was previously cleared only for the use with critically ill patients on their first day in the ICU. By administering the sepsis test much earlier, clinicians can protect a broader patient population and help to reduce the associated health care costs. We also worked in tandem with our key PCT license partners, Roche Diagnostics and bioM\u00e9rieux, so that they could receive clearance to run the test on their extensive installed base of instruments in the U.S. This will significantly expand access to this valuable diagnostic tool. We also received clearance for several other diagnostic assays as well. One was the DRI Hydrocodone Assay, which has a high level of sensitivity to help doctors quickly identify possible opioid abuse. We also received clearance for two new EliA IgG autoimmunity tests for more effective diagnosis of thyroid disease. Last, for greater accuracy in the clinical lab, we launched LabLink xL 2.0 software so clinicians can compare and validate results in real time from labs around the world. I also want to make a comment on our next-gen sequencing business as well, where we're seeing nice momentum in customer adoption of our sequencers, including the new S5 and S5 XL that we introduced about a year ago. In the quarter, we launched a number of new assays including additions to our Oncomine family of high-value oncology kits. Our new lung cell-free DNA as well as our BRCA1 and 2 assays are all designed for NGS analysis on our Ion Torrent platform. We also launched the new Ion AmpliSeq Transcriptome Human Gene Expression Kit, which enables the simultaneous analysis of more than 20,000 genes in a single assay using our Ion Chef sample prep technology as part of the work flow. In terms of highlights from a geographic perspective, we're pleased to deliver another strong quarter of growth in Asia Pacific and emerging markets, which is the second pillar of our growth strategy. Our results in Q3 were led by outstanding performance in China and India. China continues to be a significant contributor, with growth in the high teens during the quarter. We're positioning Thermo Fisher to not only take advantage of the significant opportunities available in China today, but also to help those customers meet their future plans. An important aspect of that is understanding the government's longer-term focus. During my last visit there in Q3, I spent time in Guangzhou and had the opportunity to meet with the municipal party secretary. We formalized a strategic partnership that involves working with local companies and scientific institutions in Guangzhou to advance health care, environmental protection and food safety. This is part of a national plan to boost development in the South China region. We're also partnering with Health BioMed, a leading provider of clinical diagnostic and pharmaceutical products in China. The goal is to advance the development of molecular diagnostic kits for infectious disease and pharmacogenomic screening. The kits will be based on our Applied Biosystems CE platform and is another great example of our ability to support precision medicine initiatives that are part of China's five-year plan. These are just two of the examples from the many that we have in terms of long-term growth in China. I always leave China even more energized about our prospects. It's a large and growing market. Our scale gives us a strong competitive advantage and we're well aligned with the country's strategic priorities. I also spent some time in South Korea in Q3, and a specific opportunity I want to highlight there is the demand for our biopharma services capabilities. South Korea is a key location for clinical trials research because of strong government support, its modern infrastructure and an easily accessible patient population. During the quarter, we opened a new state-of-the-art facility in Seoul to provide local and global companies with a comprehensive clinical trial support. This complements our biopharma services capabilities in the region, including those in Singapore, China, India and Japan. South Korea is also a great example of how we're leveraging our unique customer value proposition, which is the third pillar of our growth strategy. Korea's GDP is growing in line with many developed countries, but we're clearly gaining share here. That's because of the size of our sales force, our full suite of products and services and the way we effectively bring it all together to help our customers drive innovation and productivity. We have outstanding customer relationships across Korea and are well positioned to continue to gain share. As you know, we continue to invest to strengthen our customer value proposition. And the major highlight in Q3 was our acquisition of FEI, which we completed in September. FEI is a well-respected business with a leading position in electron microscopy. We're excited to add these technologies to our analytical instruments offering and extend their reach to our large lifescience customer base. I attended the day-one town halls at FEI sites in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands. I was able to meet many of our 3,000 new colleagues, and it was great to see their enthusiasm about joining Thermo Fisher. I've been impressed with the FEI teams and the operations I've visited so far. The Brno site in the Czech Republic in particular is a world-class manufacturing facility that produces a wide range of FEI products. It's also strategically located in an area with a highly-skilled workforce. The ability to leverage this site to support other parts of our company will help us to further optimize our global footprint and increase our presence in lower-cost regions. So we're very bullish about the many advantages that FEI brings to Thermo Fisher. The integration teams have hit the ground running and are implementing their plans. We're confident in our ability to achieve the $80 million of total synergies we laid out when we announced the transaction back in May. Before I move on to guidance, let me give you a quick overview of where we stand with our capital deployment activities so far this year. With the additions of Affymetrix and FEI, we've deployed more than $5 billion on strategic M&A, $1 billion in stock buybacks and we're on a path to approximately $240 million of returns in dividends in 2016. So it's been an active year for Thermo Fisher Scientific in terms of effectively deploying our capital to create value for our customers and our shareholders. Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2016. As you saw in our press release, we're raising our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. As usual, Stephen will cover the details and assumptions, but in summary, we're raising guidance based on the addition of FEI, our strong operational performance in the first nine months, and a better foreign exchange environment. We now expect revenue for the year to be in the range of $18.25 billion to $18.39 billion. This would result in 8% growth over 2015. We're raising our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.11 at the midpoint to a new range of $8.19 to $8.30, which represents 11% to 12% growth year-over-year. Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me sum up my remarks with a couple of takeaways. It was another great quarter in terms of our financial performance, and we extended our long track record of consistently delivering strong adjusted EPS growth. We closed on the acquisition of FEI and look forward to the new opportunities we'll have to create value and drive growth. With the strong nine months behind us we're on track to deliver another very successful year. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of the third quarter results for the total company, and then I'll provide some color on our four segments and conclude with the updated 2016 guidance. Before I get into the details of our financial performance, I thought it would be helpful to provide a high level view of how the quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. Operationally, we're right in line with our expectations both on organic growth and earnings generation. Given the level of volatility in foreign exchange rates so far this year, it was good to see that Q3 FX was $0.02 less adverse than we previously estimated and finally it was great to get the FEI deal closed in September, and we were able to deliver $0.04 of additional adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. So the high level summary is we had a strong Q3 and we were able to deliver $0.06 of adjusted earnings per share above what we had previously expected. Now let me give you some more color on the quarter. Starting with adjusted earnings per share, as you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS in Q3 by 13% to $2.03. GAAP EPS was $1.19 up 1% from Q3 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 9% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue included 4% organic growth, a 5% contribution from acquisitions, and a slight headwind from currency translation. In Q3, we recognized just under $100 million of revenue from FEI. Looking at our growth by geography in Q3, this was very similar to what we saw in Q2. Both North America and Europe continued to grow in the low-single digits. Asia Pacific grew in the low teens, with another strong quarter from China, which grow in the high teens, as Marc mentioned, and the rest of the world declined low single digits Turning to our operational performance, Q3 adjusted operating income increased 11% and adjusted operating margin was 23.0%, up 40 basis points from Q3 of last year. Looking at the components of our adjusted operating margin performance in Q3, we delivered solid expansion from our organic growth driven by our PPI business system and volume leverage, and this was partially offset by unfavorable business mix, strategic investments, and a modest headwind from acquisitions. This quarter, FX had no impact on operating margin. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.9% in Q3, up 60 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted gross margin expansion was driven by strong productivity, positive contributions from acquisitions and FX, and partially offset by business mix and strategic investments. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 21.8% of revenue, which is up 30 basis points versus Q3 2015, and R&D expense came in at 4.1% of revenue, down 10 basis points versus Q3 last year. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in the quarter was 6.1%. Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense was $103 million, which is $10 million higher compared to Q3 last year, mainly as a result of financing relating to our capital deployment actions this year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.1%, which is 90 basis points lower than last year as a result of our tax planning initiatives and the timing of discrete items. However, this was in line with our expectations. Average diluted shares in the quarter were 397.4 million, down 4.6 million year-over-year as a result of the share buybacks we completed in Q1, partially offset by stock option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, for the first nine months, cash flow from continuing operations was $2 billion and free cash flow was $1.7 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $290 million. This is approximately $350 million higher than our prior-year cash flow for the same period. We ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash and investments. This is higher than normal due to the timing of the financing activities related to the FEI acquisition. $1.2 billion of this was used on the first business day of Q4 to pay down debt obligations. Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $18.9 billion, up $4.8 billion sequentially from Q2 as a result of the financing activities related to the FEI acquisition, and leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 4.2 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA, up from 3.2 times at the end of Q2. After we paid down the debt on the first day of Q4, the leverage ratio was down to 4.0 times. Similar to previous quarters, we paid $60 million of dividends in Q3. And wrapping up my comments on our total company performance, ROIC continued to be strong. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC at the end of the quarter was 9.8%. So with that, I'll now provide you with some color on the performance of our four business segments. Starting with the life science solutions segment, reported revenue increased 14% in Q3 and organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter, we continued to see strong growth across a number of the businesses led by next-gen sequencing, bioproduction and biosciences. Q3 adjusted operating income in life science solutions increased 11% and adjusted operating margin was 30.1%, a decline of 70 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was in line with our expectations and the year-over-year contraction was driven by unfavorable business mix and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by positive productivity and volume pull-through. In the analytical instrument segment, which includes the FEI acquisition, reported revenue increased 15% in Q3 and organic revenue growth was 3%. In the quarter, we had strong growth contributions from our chromatography and mass spec and our environmental instruments businesses, partially offset by continued weakness in the businesses serving our industrial end markets. Q3 adjusted operating income in analytical instruments increased 30% and adjusted operating margin was 21.2% up 240 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw very strong productivity, favorable FX, good volume leverage, and a positive impact from the FEI acquisition. Expansion from these drivers was partially offset by unfavorable product mix and the impact of strategic investments Turning to the specialty diagnostics segment, in Q3 reported and organic revenue both grew 3%. We saw good growth in our transplant diagnostics and immuno-diagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income increased 5% in Q3, and adjusted operating margin was 26.8%, up 40 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was driven by strong productivity, good volume pull-through, and FX tailwinds, partially offset by the impact of strategic investments and headwinds from business mix. Finally, in the lab products and services segment, Q3 reported revenue increased 7% and organic growth was 6%. We delivered particularly strong growth in our biopharma services and channel businesses. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 3%, and adjusted operating margin was 14.8%, down 40 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin benefited from volume and productivity; however, these were more than offset by the impact of strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. Now I'll review the details of our updated full year 2016 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance. We're increasing revenue guidance by $400 million at the midpoint and increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.11 at the midpoint. Let me walk you through the details, starting with revenue. We continue to expect to generate about 4.5% organic growth for the full year of 2016. Of the $400 million increase in revenue guidance at the midpoint, $30 million reflects the slightly less adverse FX environment, and $370 million reflects the impact of FEI, which includes approximately $100 million we recognized in Q3. The FEI numbers are net of purchase accounting adjustments to reduce deferred revenue. Then on adjusted earnings per share, we've increased the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.11. This reflects $0.02 from the less adverse FX environment and $0.09 from the impact of FEI, which includes the $0.04 we recognized in Q3. And finally, with three quarters of strong operational performance behind us and factoring in the addition of FEI, we're narrowing our revenue guidance range to $140 million and narrowing our adjusted earnings per share range to $0.11. So to sum all this up, the revised 2016 revenue guidance is now a range of $18.25 billion to $18.39 billion, which would represent 8% growth versus 2015. We expect acquisitions to contribute about 4.5% to our reported revenue growth in 2016, and FX is expected to be about a 1% headwind. In terms of adjusted earnings per share, our increased 2016 guidance is now a range of $8.19 to $8.30 with a midpoint of $8.245. This represents growth of 11% to 12% versus 2015. Excluding the FX impact, this would represent adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to 13%. We are now expecting 50 basis points to 60 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year. This is slightly lower than our previous guidance of 60 basis points to 70 basis points, primarily as a result of the impact of the FEI acquisition. There are a few other details behind our 2016 guidance. Given the days impact on our 2016 fiscal calendar, I thought it would be helpful to revisit our prior comments around phasing. Our Q1 had four more days and our Q4 will have four less days that the equivalent quarters in 2015. As a result, we're expecting the reported organic growth in Q4 to be essentially flat and the days adjusted organic growth in Q4 to be about 4.5%, consistent with our previous guidance. This would also result in a full-year organic growth of about 4.5%, also consistent with our previous guidance. Net interest expense has increased $25 million from our previous guidance to $420 million as a result of the FEI acquisition. There is no change to our full-year adjusted income tax rate guidance, which is still expected to be about 14%. This implies a 15% adjusted tax rate in Q4, slightly higher than the full-year average due to the phasing earlier in the year of certain discrete tax planning actions. Our guidance does not include any future acquisitions, divestitures or share buybacks. Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be about 398 million, consistent with previous guidance. We're expecting net capital expenditure to be approximately $440 million, consistent with previous guidance. And finally, we're still expecting about $2.72 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2016, consistent with previous guidance, and forecasting that the operational cash flow generated by FEI during our period of ownership in 2016 will be offset by the related transaction and restructuring costs. As always, when interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view of how we see results playing out. And in summary, we've had three strong quarters of operational performance, a less adverse FX environment than expected and our capital deployment activities are generating strong earnings benefits in 2016 and will enhance our strategic position over the long term. All of this keeps us on track to deliver another excellent year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Jon Groberg of UBS. Please go ahead. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. And congratulations on another solid quarter. Marc, obviously, there's a lot of concern out there in the investor community around the biopharma market. You noted another strong, almost looked like accelerating, growth in that market. Any comments at all around early indications of what you may be seeing there? Any potential concern around what you're hearing from customers or elections? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Jon, thanks for the question. Been a great end market for us. The outlook continues to be very bright. Let's talk about why the market is generally good. The science is good and the number of approved drugs continues to go well. Vaccines are continuing to play a more and more important role in healthcare, and that's a good positive as well. And as more and more biotech, large molecule drugs are making it through the pipeline versus small molecules, biotech is a larger consumer on a relative basis of lifescience tools and diagnostics because it's not just in the research and clinical trials phase, but all the way into production you would use our products. So actually the industry looks very bright. And then obviously on top of that is the company's position within the industry. And we have a great value proposition with these customers and we have consistently gained share for a number of years. We have strong relationships across all of the major biotech and pharmaceutical companies. And they see us as their partner to drive innovation and productivity, and that has allowed us to have a great historical performance, but, more importantly, positioned for a very bright outlook in this end market. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Great. And then a quick follow-up, Marc, on I guess it looks to me like Affymetrix is still a little bit underperforming relative to maybe where you expected or at least what they were doing. And so I'm just curious, as you initially get to know FEIC and, again, given some of the end markets out there, are you feeling comfortable with your initial outlook of FEIC as you've gotten to know it better? Any updated thoughts there? Thanks. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So in terms of FEI, really we're very excited to have the company as part of Thermo Fisher Scientific and a great addition in terms of colleagues. The business is on track to have a good year in terms of growth, and obviously had a nice contribution in Q3 and a good contribution to our success in Q4. So integration is just getting underway. We did the planning between announcement and close, and the teams are executing well and we're very excited about what FEI is going to bring to the company over time. What we expect over time, as we said back in May, is that this business will grow faster than the company average. Thanks, Jon. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Derik de Bruin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Derik. Derik de Bruin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: So, Marc, I know it's a little early to start thinking about 2017 maybe, but you're doing 11% to 12% EPS growth this year, 12% or 13% FX adjusted. At your Analyst Day, you said that, with capital deployment, 12% to 15% EPS growth was how we should think about the Thermo model going forward. Is that still the best way to think about, given the FEI and the Affy deals that are in there, is that a good starting point for next year? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So, Derik, thanks for the question. Obviously, we'll give our guidance in early 2017 on the Q4 call. The way that I see it is you have the base operational assumptions and the capital deployment assumptions. And if I think about the environment, the environment looks very similar to what it was in May. So that puts us in a range of 4% to 6% organic growth in terms of that. And in terms of capital deployment, we will clearly benefit from the accretion that we get from FEI on a year-over-year basis, and certainly the accretion that we get from the Affymetrix transaction. So at a high level, the way you articulated it I agree with. You obviously have to work through all the math, but given the strong acquisitions that we've done this year, we're going to get a nice contribution to our earnings from the capital deployment actions in this year. Derik de Bruin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: And then just one quick follow-up. So was there any signs at all that delayed equipment purchases in the academic labs in both/either the U.S. or Europe? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: The academic end markets, the government end markets, were very similar to what we saw in Q2, with the U.S. growing in the low-single digits and the rest of the world a little bit more muted than that. And we didn't really see any meaningful changes in the trends. Derik de Bruin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Great. Thank you Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning, guys. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Ross. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : So I want to dig back into pharma. I was hoping you could maybe parse out what your expectations are going forward within the sub-segment by some of the key areas. So we've heard from the pharmas themselves and from the CROs and from the CDMOs sort of varying comments around demand. So can you give us a feel for what you're seeing in sort of base discovery and the tools and equipment that gets sold there versus production, which seems like it's still on fire. And then maybe your biopharma service business, just give us a feel if it's sort of consistent across the three or four key buckets and across the customer bases or if there's maybe one or two areas that you're either more or less constructive on. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: We're doing well, all right. So, I mean, that is the summary. So you can parse it different ways, and the growth is strong no matter how you parse it. Obviously, the bioproduction and the clinical trials logistics, or bio-pharma services businesses, continue to perform very well. And, you know, are growing a little bit above the rates there. But if you just kind of do the math, it implies that the rest is growing very strongly as well. So there wasn't much nuance in terms of the strong performance. I would say that our chromo-mass spec business obviously had a good quarter serving that business as well, but that's not implying that something did poorly. But given that there's been a lot of questions about what's going on in capital equipment, it's actually been pretty good. So we feel good about the end market. It's been a good nine months and it's been a good number of years. And we're well positioned. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : And I guess on the industrial side, and applied, is there any geographic bias to the weakness there? We've heard varying comments in sort of Eastern Europe much worse than Western Europe and maybe mix out of Japan, but China good. I'm just curious to see your perspective on that and where, maybe if anywhere, you're seeing any positive signs of stabilization or improvement. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: You know, from the industrial and applied markets, they declined very slightly in the quarter. As I read things outside of Thermo Fisher, just what's going on in the broader world, clearly industrial markets are soft globally. You know, it didn't seem like any particular geography really jumped out at us as a particular standout off of that. The applied markets in China continue to be good. So that's obviously positive; things like food safety and environmental protection. So that's a bright spot. But we didn't really get any particular pockets of weakness on the industrial or applied that we saw. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: You're welcome. . Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks. Marc, I want to go back to the academic markets. Obviously, there's kind of heightened sensitivity and I appreciate your business has been holding up better than others. It does seem like academic went from low single digit growth to slight growth. But can you give us a sense from your perspective on the market on what's going on? I mean, you were very positive at the beginning of the year on NIH dynamics and now we're seeing the outlays drop off about 13% in September. Obviously, university endowments are under pressure as well. So I guess what I'm trying to get to is there a risk that you might actually see this in the fourth quarter? If we go back to 3Q 2011 you saw things later than your peers. And what's the risk for bigger ticket items like cryo-em [cryo electron microscopy], which you now have with FEIC? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So, Tycho, the first thing I'd say I think we're performing incredibly well. I don't think anything other than that. And then in terms of the academic and government markets, if you go back to what we said at the very beginning of the year, right, which is probably the best way to think about what's different or what's the same, we expected that the year would start slower in the U.S. in academic and government and then build as the year went on. And actually the year started a little bit stronger than we had expected and has stayed steady with that that low single digit growth. So it came a little bit early, and it's been very steady. In terms of the other geographies, obviously, given that we expected academic and government to be a little bit better in aggregate, it basically says those must be slightly weaker, and clearly that's been offset by the strength in biopharma. So that's the sort of looking back in late January what's changed. In terms of are we off cycle versus others, I don't know. I think we're gaining share versus others. But that's my opinion. And, you know, when we thought about our range of outcomes for the year, we felt comfortable with raising the guidance at the end of Q2 to 4.5% organic growth, and we feel comfortable reaffirming that 4.5% outlook. And the way I think about it is our commercial teams cover a range of customers. We focus on where the best opportunities are, and, in a way, we don't force a lot of micro level of analysis for the investment community. It's our job to manage through it and we feel well positioned to deliver a really nice year in terms of performance. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then on FEI, one of the dynamics they had talked about prior to the acquisition was an anticipated recovery in the semi market as you had the shift to 10-nanometer production, can you maybe talk about whether your view on that has changed at all and whether we might see that at some point next year. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, so given that we own the business for nine days, you know, but obviously been working with the team for a while, the life sciences business is performing very well both with strong revenue growth and strong bookings performance. The industrial-related material sciences businesses are a little bit more muted. And as we look at the numbers, it seems like the industrial businesses have bottomed out, which is encouraging. And then, obviously, as we get into owning the business longer and, in the future, we can give you more color in that. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Tycho. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Jack. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Marc, you know, I appreciate your perspective on the healthcare channel. There's been a little bit more noise on the provider side as of late. Just as you've talked with your customers, what are they saying about volumes? And as it pertains to the specialty diagnostics business, which of the segments need to improve to get us back to the 4% to 6% target range? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So, Jack, good question. As I think about the healthcare and diagnostic, it's very similar in Q3 to what we saw in Q2. What I would say is the more \u2013 the super high value added businesses, transplant diagnostics, the allergy and autoimmunity business, the clinical next-gen sequencing businesses, those businesses are performing very well. The more routine volume related businesses, your basic consumables you use every day, has been a little bit softer but not a change in trend. So what would have to happen for pickup in growth, two different factors could help drive it. You don't need both. Which is a little higher level of activity in the basic consumption of the products for consumables would help. And the other is, we have a number of programs that are driving our life science tools into the clinic, and they will be meaningful drivers as well. So the driving into the clinic, that's in our control entirely, and that puts us very optimistic about the mid-term prospects for the diagnostic business. And then we'll always take the upside if the markets get even better. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And then just to follow-up on the Affymetrix integration, how that's going and any update on the array environment, any sequential changes you've seen there. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So, Jack, in terms of Affymetrix, let me give you an update on the integration, let me give you an update on the business performance. Integration has gone really well. We are running very smoothly there. Our synergies are running ahead of plan. We'll achieve about $11 million in synergies this year, which is $5 million to $6 million better than we had assumed for this year. In terms of the business performance, the bioscience business is doing very well, growing sharply, and that's very positive. The micro array business, like we mentioned last quarter, is soft. We expect it to be soft for a few more quarters as we really drive adoption of the precision medicine microarray, and we're obviously actively marketing that. So that's a quick update on Affymetrix. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: All right. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Based on what we've heard from peers in the group, I think it's fair to assert that your organic revenue growth performance in the quarter and your guidance for Q4 looks fairly solid, certainly relatively speaking. Other companies do seem to have suggested that the end of the quarter was maybe not as strong as expected and that the order book at the end of Q3 and in the early part of Q4 maybe didn't build as much as they might have expected. Could you comment on end of quarter and early Q4 order trends? Relatedly, if there's anything notable by geography or end market? And I guess also relatedly, in a seemingly more uncertain environment, are there any changes you're making regarding spending or operational plans relative to how you were planning a quarter ago? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, in terms of the sequencing of the quarter, nothing really jumped out as particularly meaningful in terms of what happened in each month. And obviously we have the benefit of the first three weeks of October's results, so if they were off that trend line, that would have factored into our thinking, and it wasn't. So from that perspective, we didn't really see anything from a calendarization that was any particular impact. In terms of spending and those things, we're managing the business like we always do, which is we spend aggressively in the areas to drive value-added, and we're very conservative and frugal on the things that are low value-added, and that's kind of how we run the company day in and day out. So no significant changes on that front either. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks for that, Marc. And then a quick follow-up. Would you guys be willing to provide growth by end market in Europe and parse out how growth compared in Eastern versus Western Europe? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: I don't know the growth by end market by Europe because we don't manage the company that way. Qualitatively, Western Europe was a little bit stronger than Eastern Europe in terms of performance, but that's not a change in the trajectory over the last several quarters. But that's what we've seen. And from recollection, Germany had a pretty good quarter in terms of growth within the Western Europe, but that's not implying anything in particular about any of the other countries. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks again. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Steve, are you there? Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I am. Sorry. Got a little feedback there. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. So we've covered a lot of ground here in the Q&A and discussions around what's going on out in the end markets. But, Marc, I wonder if you could put it into broader perspective for us and think about as you go into business planning for 2017, from your perspective, what are the two or three things that you want to focus on most acutely as you make a decision about where to put the budget within the 4% to 6% range? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, the things that I think about in planning, it always goes through the, one, new product launches and what are the exciting things we've got in the pipeline and what the impact is going to be and making sure that's well characterized. Two, any particular special causes year-over-year one way or another. And at least as I sit here today, I don't see any special effects one way or another, so next year should look like this year in terms of some of the high-level things. One of the things we mentioned at the beginning of the year, which we're continuing to execute on, which I'm encouraged about, is when the medical device tax was put on a two-year hiatus, we spent the savings on investing in some mid-term restructuring activities. We will get one more year of that hiatus and we will invest those monies as well. So there's no effect year-over-year, but that means we'll have invested about $30 million in actions to drive more efficiency in the second half of 2017 and 2018, which I think is really good and encouraging and is something that we embedded into our long-term model. So those are some of the things we're thinking about. And I know that Stephen is looking forward to giving a detailed set of guidance at the beginning of 2017. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And a follow-up for me is actually on competitive positioning. I think, as you can tell from the questions here in Q&A, we're all struggling to try to develop a broader perspective on the environment, given the fairly varied results in terms of growth from the companies in broader lifescience tools and diagnostics here over the last few weeks. Marc, do you think that you're getting stronger over the course of the year in terms of your competitive positioning? Is market share, even in certain specific verticals, a driver for you more so than it was even 12 months ago now that, in some areas, thinking about eCommerce, you're a stronger player than arguably you were 12 or 24 months ago? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, it's our job to widen the gap versus others in the industry every day, right? That's what we're paid to do is to make the company stronger and get better every day. And when I think about how we're performing this year, I think the company is performing very well. I'm very proud of the effort and the capabilities of our team, and they're delivering. So I think that's very positive. Obviously, we benefit from the strong competitive position we have. We have a very strong eCommerce platform, as you said. We have the largest commercial team. We have the best commercial team, in my mind. And, when I think about it, we've got great products; we've got a unique position in the emerging markets, which allows us to capitalize on those opportunities. I highlighted a couple during the quarter, but the way I really believe it is when I visit a customer in China, it's rationale for them to doing a disproportionate amount of their business with us because they simply get a better experience. We've got better people, better supply chain, and a more comprehensive set of offerings. So I think we're very well positioned, and we feel good about the outlook for the balance of the year and certainly as we get into 2017 and beyond. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Really appreciate the perspective. Thanks again. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, guys. Thank you. Just maybe one more question on the academic side. We're obviously trying to reconcile what we've seen elsewhere in the sector this earnings season versus what you guys are saying, which is clearly more dovish. And as we look at the end of this year and into next year, it seems like the overall budget, at least in the U.S., should be a little bit better, Europe hopefully stable, and China hopefully better. So if we look at sort of the global picture for academic funding, is there any reason to think why we might see pockets of softness? And I know you guys can only speak for yourselves, but as the prior question pointed out, we're just trying to reconcile disparate data points in the context of a generally better funding environment Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, I guess it's hard for \u2013 there's always challenges in the world. We do our very best to navigate through them so that we don't have to spend a lot of time explaining all of the things that go wrong. I think we do a good job of that because we deliver good results consistently. I guess it's \u2013 I really can't reconcile for you. I think the only two comments I can make is that, we had very good growth in chrome and mass spec. So if I look at what I have read about that, we did really well in that end market. And when I look at our clinical next-gen sequencing business, we grew very quickly. So I really can't reconcile for you what others are saying. It's hard to do. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Sure, sure. I understand that. Maybe I'd just follow up on the NGS comment you guys called out in the script. You mentioned it again here. Can you talk a little bit about the types of customers where you think you're seeing the most traction? Clearly, it's a high growth marketplace, and a rising tide floats all boats, but it has been a market where we had one pretty strong player here, and in the context of that competitive dynamic, I'm interested to know where you guys are finding the best upside and kind of the path forward to continue that momentum. Thank you Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, Isaac, our business is really focused on the clinical applications of sequencing, and we benefit from the ease of use, the low capital cost, and, most importantly, the very low volume of sample that you need to run oncology panel on our sequencer. And that's allowed for really good adoption, and you're seeing a steady cadence of new assays that we're launching, which reaffirms to our customers that we're investing and meeting their needs. So that's the area that we have seen good momentum in. Thanks, Isaac. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah, hi, good morning. Thanks, guys. Marc, maybe just on pricing, obviously a mixed operating environment for interest and sales with industrial pretty choppy but pharma doing well. So can you maybe just touch on net pricing in the AI business and then what your expectations there are as we look out a bit? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Hi, Dan, this is Stephen. I'll take the pricing one. So we look at pricing in total for the company, and we're about 60 basis points of price. So it's very consistent with what we've seen for the rest of this year, and actually what we saw pretty much for all of last year. We're kind of lapping some of the things that we did in Japan in terms of the FX offsets, but that's going to be offset by some pricing actions we're taking in the UK as well. So pricing has been pretty consistent for us. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on China and what you're seeing there with the precision medicine programs that you highlighted. I'm just curious about how you're finding predictability there or just maybe visibility there. Any reason that would be more or less sort of speculative in nature than some of the other things going on in China? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: We've been on a really nice consistent roll for a number of quarters, and having visited China twice last quarter, the business is performing well, the bookings are strong, the outlook is good, and so we really haven't seen anything that would say that visibility is any different or if there's any particular storm clouds on the horizon. The business seems to look good, and we're benefiting from our strong competitive position here. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks very much Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Operator, we have time for just one more. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Sung Ji Nam of Avondale Partners. Please go ahead. Sung Ji Nam - Avondale Partners LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Marc, I was wondering, you know, you guys seem to have a pretty unique diagnostic business with decent margins. Given your recent announcement about the cancer \u2013 your participation in the cancer moon shot initiative, and I believe you also have a prostate cancer testing under development, I was curious as to if your kind of interest in the diagnostic market has shifted a little bit and potentially considering, you know, higher risk opportunities. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: We have a really strong position there. It's been a core part of our business for a long time. But we really haven't changed the risk profile of it as much. We do have, obviously, a couple big investment areas that will position us for accelerating growth over time. One is in the adoption of clinical next-gen sequencing into those applications, and our announcement, as you highlight, on the cancer moon shot is an example of that. And the other is obviously in the area of mass spectrometry where we've got a fairly big program as well. So we're not really taking a different strategy, but we've been pursuing for a number of years on driving new applications into the clinic while benefiting from a very strong highly profitable consumables business. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So, thank you for the question. Let me wrap up with just a quick comment, which is as I reflect back, we're certainly on track to deliver another excellent year, and we look forward to announcing our year-end results early in 2017. And, of course, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Thermo Fisher Scientific 2016 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin the call. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts and Presentations, until February 17, 2017.

So with that, I will now turn the call to Marc. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our Q4 and year-end call. I'm pleased to report that we delivered an excellent 2016 and we had many significant accomplishments that strengthened our industry leadership. At a high level, we leveraged our unique scale and depth of capabilities to gain market share. We continued to execute our growth strategy to strengthen our competitive position. We deployed significant capital to enhance our value proposition for our customers and create value for our shareholders. And we delivered another very strong year of financial performance. I'll cover each of these highlights of my remarks, starting with our fourth quarter financial results. We delivered very strong adjusted EPS growth in Q4, with a 14% increase to $2.41. Our revenue in Q4 grew 6% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income increased 14% and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 160 basis points to 24.8%. Turning to the full year. Our strong adjusted EPS performance all year led to excellent growth of 12% in 2016 to $8.27 a share. We grew revenues by 8% for the full year to a record $18.27 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 10% and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points to 23.1%. We've steadily and significantly increased our profitability, and this is a tribute to the power of our PPI business system. PPI has allowed us to continuously expand our margins over the past 10 years, which positions us for a very strong future. In summary, our team achieved a great year, and that positions us very well going into 2017. Turning to our performance by end market, starting with pharma and biotech. We delivered a strong Q4 to cap off another excellent year serving this customer base. We grew 10% in this end market for the full year, with strong performance in our Bioproduction business, BioPharma services as well as our Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry businesses. We've taken advantage of the underlying strength in the pharma and biotech market and our excellent relationships with these customers to leverage our unique value proposition and continue to gain share. In health care and diagnostics, conditions were similar throughout the year and we grew just below the company average in 2016. Our clinical next-gen sequencing business performed very well and delivered strong growth for the year. Our performance in academic and government end markets in Q4 was similar to what we saw all year and we grew in the low-single digits in 2016. Last, in industrial and applied, we grew in the low-single digits for the full year. Our businesses serving in the applied markets grew well all year long, as we benefited from our strength in serving food safety and environmental applications. In Q4, we were encouraged by early signs of an improvement in our core industrial markets, which was reflected in stronger bookings. Now let me shift gears to talk about our growth strategy and highlight a few examples from the year and the quarter that show how we're successfully executing our strategy to position Thermo Fisher for a bright future. As you know, we have a proven strategy that's based on three pillars : developing high-impact, innovative new products; leveraging our scale in Asia-Pacific and emerging markets; and delivering our unique customer value proposition. So let me start with innovation. The key takeaway here is that we spent $750 million in R&D in 2016 and we continue to benefit from our industry-leading investment. We are putting that money to good use, and as you can see that by our track record of meaningfully great product launches year-in and year-out. And 2016 was no exception. I covered these in detail during the year, so I'll just hit some of the highlights this morning. We continue to strengthen our industry leadership in analytical instruments. We extended the capabilities of our flagship Orbitrap Mass Spec platform by launching new Q Exactive instruments for BioPharma and applied markets. We also raised the performance bar in Chromatography, with our new Integrion HPIC system. To refresh our leading installed base of lab equipment, we introduced our TSX high-performance refrigerators and freezers. These new products complement our very successful TSX ultra-low temperature freezers launched about a year ago, which are helping customers to meet their goals for both sustainability and performance. In the clinical space, we continue to introduce new research and diagnostic tools to improve patient care while lowering the cost of care. We launched new targeted assays for cancer research that run on our Ion Torrent Next-Generation Sequencing instruments. We also received FDA clearance to broaden the use of our sepsis test in the U.S., and we introduced new tests for autoimmune disease and drugs of abuse. To cap off a great year, we launched a number of products in Q4 as well. Let me give you a few examples. We launched the new Clariom Pico assays for more effective biomarker discovery, which are based on the new microarray technologies we gained through the acquisition of Affymetrix. We also introduced Heratherm Refrigerated Incubators that don't use traditional refrigerants and consume less energy. And last, we developed a new RadEye handheld instrument designed to locate a wide range of radioactive materials using a single device. We were also proud to be recognized externally during the quarter for our contributions to the scientific community. Two of our CRISPR genome editing tools were selected by Scientist Magazine to be among the top 10 innovations in 2016. And R&D Magazine named our Vanquish Flex UHPLC system as one of the top 100 innovations for the year. So, clearly, another very strong year for innovation, all the way to the end. Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy, we continue to expand our capabilities in Asia-Pacific and emerging markets, and we achieved very strong performance here in 2016. China led the way with growth in the high-teens, and it was also a very good year for India and South Korea. We have great momentum in the region and we've continued to build on that with particular focus on investing to support key customer applications. You may recall that we opened a new BioPharma Services facility in South Korea in Q3 to help meet increasing demand for clinical trials in that country. In Q4, we added a new Bioproduction development lab to our China Innovation Center in Shanghai. The goal is to introduce customers to an array of advanced technologies and provide localized R&D for media and cell culture applications to meet the specific needs of the local biopharma and vaccine industry. We're also helping them to meet the increasingly stringent production approval criteria in China's rapidly growing market. Our scale and depth of capabilities in the region, and especially in China, is clearly a competitive advantage for us. We've established an industry-leading presence and we continue to build on that to serve our customers in this large and growing market. Based on our 2016 results, emerging markets now account for 20% of our total revenue, up a percentage point from the previous year. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our unique customer value proposition. As you know, we have a strong track record in the biopharma end market. We've continued to gain share with these customers by leveraging our value proposition to help them accelerate innovation and improve productivity. Our scale and depth are clear differentiators. And what sets us further apart is that we continue to enhance our offering to help our customers meet new challenges. Let me give you two recent examples. A key area of focus today is on advancing precision medicine. We have multiple technology platforms necessary to make progress here, from mass spectrometry to targeted gene sequencing, as well as our cloud capabilities for data sharing. In Q4 we announced that were joining the Cancer Moonshot Initiative. As you probably know, the goal here is to improve cancer detection at early stages and ultimately prevent the disease. It's an all-hands effort between the government and private sector to make these diagnostics and treatments more accessible to patients. Our broad range of technologies positions us to play a key role in supporting this important effort as well as other efforts around the globe. Looking ahead, we see breakthroughs in structural biology as another exciting new opportunity for us as well. Our complementary capabilities from FEI and our leadership in life sciences gives us a key competitive advantage here. As we continue to enhance our customer value proposition, both organically and through acquisition, we'll be ready to help our customers address their most pressing needs, which will fuel our growth. Last, I'll turn to capital deployment, and we had a very successful year on that front as well. We continued to execute our strategy, which is a combination of returning capital to shareholders and investing in acquisitions that strengthen our position as the industry leader. In terms of returning capital, we bought back $1.25 billion of shares and that includes $250 million that we deployed in December. And we also returned approximately $240 million in dividends through the year. Turning to M&A. It was a very active year and we deployed about $5.5 billion on strategic acquisitions. Affymetrix strengthened our leadership in biosciences and added new complementary capabilities to our leading genetic sciences offering. And our acquisition of FEI, which was the third largest in our history, brought industry-leading electron microscopy technologies to Thermo Fisher. The combination of FEI with our existing portfolio creates exciting opportunities, both in material science as well as in the extremely high-growth field of structural biology. We closed this transaction in late September. The integration is right on track and the business is performing very well. So in total, we deployed approximately $7 billion of our capital in 2016 to strengthen our strategic position and create shareholder value. Let me now turn to our guidance for 2017. Stephen will cover the details and outline all the assumptions for our revenue and earnings guidance. As you'd expect, we're planning to extend our long track record of consistent and strong financial performance in 2017. In terms of our revenue, we expect to deliver between $19.38 billion and $19.62 billion in 2017, which would result in 6% to 7% growth over 2016. We're initiating adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $9.06 to $9.24. This would lead to 10% to 12% growth over the very strong $8.27 we delivered this past year. So before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me reiterate our takeaways from the year. We executed well to deliver excellent financial performance. We strengthened our competitive position by continuing to execute our proven growth strategy. And we deployed significant capital to create value for our customers and our shareholders. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through our fourth quarter and full-year results for the total company, then I'll provide some color on our four segments and conclude with a detailed review of our 2017 guidance. Before I get into the details of our financial performance, I thought it'd be helpful to provide a high-level view of how the year played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. Organic growth was in line with our previous guidance range and we delivered just under 4.5% organic growth for the full year. From an earnings standpoint, we finished $0.03 higher than our previous guidance midpoint. This was driven by good performance from the FEI acquisition as well as FX, tax rate and share count being slightly more favorable than we'd previously estimated. For the full year 2016, we delivered $8.27 of adjusted EPS, 12% growth year-over-year despite a 1% headwind from foreign exchange. Free cash flow was $2.74 billion for the year, slightly higher than our guidance. So, overall, another year of excellent financial performance. Now let me give you more color on the quarter and the full year. Starting with adjusted earnings per share, as you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS in Q4 by 14% to $2.41. For the full year, as I just mentioned, adjusted EPS was $8.27, up 12% versus 2015. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $1.59, up 6% from Q4 last year, and $5.09 for full year 2016, up 3% versus 2015. On the top line, in Q4 our reported revenue grew 6% year-over-year. This included 8% growth from acquisitions and a 1% headwind from foreign exchange. Normalizing Q4 for fewer days, we estimate that organic growth was approximately 4% during the quarter. As you're aware, the way our fiscal calendar fell in 2016, we had four extra billing days in Q1 and four fewer billing days in Q4, but there was no impact on the year as a whole. So for the full year, reported revenue grew 8% year-over-year. The 2016 reported revenue includes just under 4.5% organic growth, 4% growth from acquisitions and a 1% negative impact from foreign exchange. Moving to our growth by geography in Q4, I'll provide you detail normalizing for the four fewer days in the quarter to provide a better understanding of relative performance by region. Within the quarter, North America grew low-single digits. Europe grew mid-single digits. Asia-Pacific grew low-double digits, with another strong contribution from China. And Rest of the World declined in the low-single digits. Turning to our operational performance. Q4 adjusted operating income increased 14% and adjusted operating margin was 24.8%, up 160 basis points from Q4 of last year. As expected, the fewer number of days in Q4 versus the same period last year had a 40 basis point positive impact on operating margins. The remainder of the strong margin expansion during the quarter was driven by positive mix and the continued gains from our PPI business system. This is partially offset by strategic investments and the dilutive impact of acquisitions. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 10% and the adjusted operating margin was 23.1%, up 60 basis points from 2015. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 49.4% in the quarter, up 170 basis points from the prior year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 48.8%, up 50 basis points from 2015. For both the quarter and full year, gross margin expansion was driven by very strong productivity, good contribution from acquisitions and modest tailwind from FX. Additionally, within the quarter, we saw the impact of favorable business mix. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 20.3% of revenue, which was down 30 basis points versus Q4 2015, and R&D expense came in at 4.3% of revenue, up 40 basis points versus Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 21.6%, down 10 basis points compared to full-year 2015, and R&D expense is 4.1% of sales, flat to prior year. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue for the year was 6.3%. Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense was $117 million, which is $23 million higher compared to Q4 last year, driven mainly by increased debt levels related to our acquisitions. Net interest expense for the full year was $421 million, an increase of $37 million from 2015. Adjusted other income in Q4 was $11 million. This was $17 million higher than Q4 last year, mainly due to non-operational foreign exchange. Our Q4 adjusted tax rate was 14.6%, which is 160 basis points higher than last year due to the timing of discrete tax planning items, and was in line with our expectations. Our full-year adjusted tax rate was 13.8%, similar to 2015. Q4 average diluted shares were 397 million, down 5.4 million year-over-year as a result of $1 billion of share buybacks completed in Q1 and an additional $250 million completed in Q4, partially offset by option dilution. For the full year, average diluted shares were 397.4 million, down 4.5 million from 2015. For the full year, foreign exchange was a year-over-year headwind of $145 million of revenue, $40 million headwind on adjusted operating income, $10 million tailwind on other income and a $0.07 headwind overall on adjusted earnings per share. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet for the full year. Cash flow from continuing operations was $3.16 billion and free cash flow was $2.74 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of approximately $420 million. This is approximately $320 million higher than 2016 and slightly ahead of our guidance. During 2016, we continued returning capital to shareholders, with $1.25 billion of share buybacks and $240 million in dividends. We successfully deployed capital to strengthen our customer value proposition through strategic acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Affymetrix and FEI. All told, our total capital deployment in 2016 was approximately $7 billion. We ended the quarter with about $790 million in cash and investments. And we finished the year with total debt of $16.6 billion, down $2.3 billion from the end of Q3, driven by strong debt pay down during the quarter. Our leverage ratio at the end of the year was 3.6 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA, which is down from 4.2 times at the end of Q3 and in line with our guidance. Wrapping up my comments on the total company performance, we continued to improve ROIC through the year, even in light of the significant acquisition activity in 2016. Adjusted ROIC in 2016 was 9.9%, a 40 basis point increase over 2015. So with that, I'll now provide you some color on the performance of our four business segments. As I highlighted previously, for the total company, foreign exchange continued to be a headwind for the top line of our segments and impacted their year-over-year revenue growth and adjusted operating margins to varying degrees. The four fewer calendar days impacted segment revenue and margins to varying degrees as well. So starting with Life Sciences Solutions segment, which includes the Affymetrix acquisition, reported revenue increased 10% in Q4. Normalizing for the days impact, we estimate organic revenue growth was approximately 9% in Q4. Similar to last quarter, we saw strong growth across the segment, including our Bioproduction, Next-Generation Sequencing and Biosciences businesses. For the full year, reported revenue grew 12% and organic growth of 7%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 16% and adjusted operating margin was 33.3%, which is 170 basis points higher than the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating margin expansion was driven by strong organic contributions from volume growth, as well as business mix and strong productivity. This was partially offset by headwinds from FX, the days impact, strategic investments and the expected dilutive impact from acquisitions. For the full year 2016, adjusted operating margin was 30.4%, an increase of 30 basis points over 2015. In the Analytical Instrument segment, which, as a reminder, includes the FEI acquisition, reported revenue increased 32% in Q4. Normalizing for the days impact, we estimate that organic revenue growth was approximately 3% in Q4. In the quarter, we benefited from strong growth contributions from both our Chromatography and Mass Spec businesses. And the FEI acquisition, now our Electron Microscopy business, also had a strong quarter. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment grew 14% and organic growth was 3%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 46% and adjusted operating margin was 24.5%, up 240 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw very strong productivity, a positive contribution from the four fewer days and favorable foreign exchange. This was partially offset by unfavorable volume pull-through and business mix as well as the expected dilutive impact of acquisitions and strategic investments. For the full year 2016, adjusted operating income increased 22% and adjusted operating margin was 20.3%, 120 basis points higher than 2015. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment in Q4, reported revenue decreased 4%. Normalizing for the days impact, we estimate that organic revenue growth was approximately 3% positive and was consistent across the businesses. For the full year, reported revenue grew 3% and organic growth was 4%. Adjusted operating income was flat in Q4 compared to 2015, and adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, up 100 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin within the quarter benefited from positive contributions from our PPI business system and business mix, along with a tailwind from foreign exchange offset by the days impact and strategic investments. For the full year 2016, adjusted operating income increased 4% and adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, up 30 basis points from 2015. And finally, in Lab Products and Services segment, Q4 reported revenue decreased 3%. Normalizing for the days impact, we estimate that organic growth in Q4 was approximately 3% positive. For the full year, reported revenue grew 6% and organic growth was 5%. In Q4, adjusted operating income in the segment declined 4% and adjusted operating margin was 14.6%, down 10 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin benefited from good productivity and four fewer days of cost. However, this was more than offset by negative business mix in the quarter. For the full year 2016, adjusted operating income increased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 15%, flat to the prior year. So with that, I'd like to review the details of our 2017 guidance, which represents another year of excellent operational performance. As Marc mentioned, we're initiating a 2017 adjusted EPS guidance range of $9.06 to $9.24, which is 10% to 12% growth over 2016. In terms of revenue, our guidance range is $19.38 billion to $19.62 billion, which is growth of 6% to 7% over 2016. And we're expecting to deliver 4% of organic revenue growth in 2017. Now I'll outline the assumptions that we factored into our guidance. We're assuming that foreign exchange is a $300 million revenue headwind for 2017, now an impact of just over 1.5%. This reflects the average rates over the course of January. We assume that this pulls through at approximately 27% due to the mix of currencies and the addition of FEI. Foreign currency is reducing adjusted EPS growth by $0.20, or just under 2.5%. If you'd look at our 2017 guidance on an FX-neutral basis, the adjusted EPS growth range would be 12% to 14%. Given the adverse FX environment, we've implemented actions that will offset about a quarter of the $0.20 FX headwind on adjusted EPS. These offsets are included in our operational guidance. We expect acquisitions completed in 2016 will contribute just over 4% to our reported revenue growth in 2017 and $0.30 of adjusted EPS increase year-over-year. This puts us well on track to achieve the three-year synergy targets for the acquisitions. Turning to adjusted operating margin. We're expecting 40 basis points to 60 basis points of expansion year-over-year. To give you some color on the 50 basis points mid-point of guidance, from an operational standpoint, a combination of our proven productivity levers in our PPI business system and the FX offset actions are expected to deliver 55 basis points of margin expansion. Acquisitions are expected to be neutral to margins and foreign exchange is expected to be slightly dilutive. Moving below the line, we expect net interest expense to be in the range of $440 million to $450 million, about $30 million higher than 2016, primarily as the result of the debt we took on for acquisitions in 2016 and expected increases in interest rates in 2017. Other income is expected to be approximately $15 million lower than 2016. The non-operating foreign exchange benefits experienced in 2016 are not expected to repeat and we expect to realize lower joint venture income year-over-year following the sale of our glass manufacturing JV in Q4 2016. We're assuming an adjusted income tax rate of 13.3% versus 13.8% in 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to the adoption of the new FASB rules on the accounting treatment of excess tax benefits on stock compensation. We assume this will reduce our tax rate by approximately 75 basis points. Our guidance does not include the benefit of any potential tax reform that may occur in the U.S. We're assuming net capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million. Free cash flow is expected to be $3.15 billion in 2017, up $410 million year-over-year, mainly due to higher earnings and lower cash taxes. In terms of capital deployment, we're assuming that we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends. Our guidance also assumes a total of $750 million of share buybacks in 2017, $500 million of which we have already completed in January and another $250 million that we assume we will undertake later in the year. We estimate that full-year average diluted shares will be in the range of 393 million to 394 million, down approximately 4 million from 2016, and the impact of these buybacks more than offsetting option dilution. Our guidance assumes that we use excess cash to repay outstanding short-term debt and, as always, does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures. Finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year. As you think about modeling our organic growth calendarization, due to one less selling day in Q1, you should expect slightly lower than average growth in the first quarter. And in terms of adjusted EPS, we're expecting the same phasing as 2016 when you look at each quarter as a percentage of the total year. As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view on how we see the year playing out. So in summary, in 2016 we had another year of very strong tactical and strategic execution. This enabled us to deliver excellent financial results and execute really well on our capital deployment strategy to further enhance our strategic position over the long term. We look forward to delivering another strong year in 2017. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to open it up for Q&A. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Derik. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Derik. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : 9% organic revenue growth in Life Sciences Solutions, that's a bigly number, to quote somebody. Can you give us a little bit more color on what's driving that? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So, Derik, the business had a very strong year. And when I look at the combination between the Life Sciences Solutions business kind of year three into the integration, you're seeing the full potential of our company in terms of just great performance. We saw strength in our Biosciences business. We saw excellent strength in our Bioproduction business and excellent strength in our Clinical Next-Gen Sequencing. So that combination was common through the year and continued into the fourth quarter. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And just a little bit of a follow up. Are you getting any sense, given the amount of uncertainty that's out there with the new administration, that there's going to be any hesitation at all in spending in Q1? Basically, your expectations are you have a day headwind, but you're expecting a little bit softer organic revenue growth, more so than normal seasonality in Q1 because of some potential hesitation in spending in pharma or academia until they figure out what's going on? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: I think the way we think about the phasing is with the 4% organic growth in the guidance, we're just assuming a difference based on the calendar days. So a little bit below the 4% in Q1, and then obviously mathematically slightly above the 4% average over the balance of three quarters. So that's the phasing. In terms of the views on certainty or uncertainty, I've had the opportunity actually in the month of January to see a very significant number of customers, interacting with probably about 25 CEOs or head of major academic institutions around the world. My take is that there is optimism based on a more business-friendly environment in the U.S., but that optimism will start to pan out into good news over time because none of the policies are really in effect. So there's a bit of let's figure out what's going to happen. But I would say versus a year ago, actually I thought the tone was more positive as I did my kind of year-end reviews and catch-up with our customers. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good morning, guys. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Ross. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : If we think about underlying trends from an end market standpoint, obviously a lot of noise in Q4 because of the days impact. But if you can think about versus plan maybe where things came in potentially ahead and then where maybe you saw order trends, if at all, maybe not hit what you were looking for as we enter the first part of the year, what were the end markets you would sort of highlight for us to watch in the first part of the year that are probably most important relative to whether there's upside or maybe a bit of pressure on the organic line? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So, Ross, if I think about the fourth quarter, the one thing that was different was really the industrial portion of our industrial and applied, as bookings after really four very difficult and consistently difficult years clearly picked up. It's longer lead time items, so that really probably doesn't show up in the numbers until Q2 and Q3. But the thing we're really looking at is that bookings trend continue, because that was encouraging. We're assuming this year that last year we had low-single digit growth in the industrial and applied markets, and we are assuming in our guidance that we will be at or around the company average, a little bit of a pick up in that market. That really is the only significant thing that I'd say that we really saw from an overall end market perspective. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : What do you make of all the probably more investor concern in pharma and more on the CapEx side where folks are looking at all of the noise coming on drug pricing and the like and are worried about that market decelerating. It certainly doesn't feel like that's the case. And I guess from your standpoint, you've been pretty consistent with your messaging. But as you spend a lot of time with customers, maybe give us a little bit of feel or color how they're kind of interpreting the opportunity set on the pipeline versus maybe some of the risks they see to their business on the policy side and how they're kind of calibrating those two things from a purchasing standpoint. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. So as you know, we're very well positioned serving this customer set and have delivered very strong growth for quite a number of years. And that's been in environments that were very good and environments that were actually quite challenging, right? So our value proposition of helping our customers be more innovative and productive has helped us gain share through the different parts of the cycle. As we discussed with our customers, generally they feel good about the science that they're doing and they feel good about what the prospects are for their investments. So what I would say is that we haven't seen a significant change in tone. Obviously, they'll navigate the various dialogues as will every industry will have their own nuances that they have to address in the current state. But I didn't see a change really in tone. What we're assuming, Ross, in our guidance is that we will grow mid to high-single digits serving this end market versus our 10% comparison for the year. And that's the same posture that we've taken the last few years of using BioPharma as \u2013 or believing that our growth will be strongest in that end market and giving a little bit of a broader range because we obviously have a good comparison in terms of performing well last year. But we feel good about the outlook in the market. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Very helpful. Thanks, Marc. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: You're welcome, Ross. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to start with the Lab Products and Services segment. I think even after adjusting for the workdays, it was a little bit softer than we were looking for. Can you walk through some of the products? You mentioned clinical trial logistics, again, good growth. What was moving the other way in the quarter? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So, if I think about the year-end in the segment that probably saw the most effect in terms of the year-end pattern, it probably sits in that segment, less so a specific business, than the following dynamic. The last three years, kind of the 2013, 2014, 2015 type timeframe, we had very robust year-end spending. When we look at the year-end spend we saw in 2016, it was kind of more of a normal level of spend and that would be what would be most reflected in our Lab Products and Services business. So that's where we saw it, from that perspective, being a little bit softer. When you look at things like stack comparisons and things of that sort, actually the trends are identical throughout the year. So when we look at the underlying health, it's pretty much identical through the four quarters. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, Stephen, you mentioned the guide does not include potential net benefit from tax reform. Could you just give the latest thoughts on policy and how the moving parts impact Thermo? Thanks. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Sure. So, obviously, it's a very fluid situation in terms of U.S. tax reform and a lot of press, but not many details. As we assess the various logical options that are being discussed, we're confident we'll see a net benefit to our current tax rate. The benefit has the potential to be significant because there are really two key factors. First, we're a net exporter, which is a positive should a border adjustment provision be part of the plan. And secondly, the majority of the taxes we pay today are actually in the U.S. So even with the potential limitation on interest deductibility, the rate coming down would certainly be beneficial to us. And in terms of repatriation, we already have a very efficient structure that has substantial capacity on a go-forward basis. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Excellent. Thank you. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Jack. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Thanks. Maybe I'll just start out with some rounding out the end market discussion questions. Marc, can you tell us what's embedded for academic growth for the year? And then it also seems like you saw a little bit of a pick up in Europe. We've heard about that from other peers. So I'm wondering if you can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing there. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. So, Tycho, thanks for the question. In terms of academic and government, we had low-single digit growth for the full year. And in the quarter when you normalize for days, it was pretty much the same conditions we saw as the full year. Geographically, the U.S. and China have stronger growth. And other parts of the world were not strong. From a guidance perspective in 2017, we're looking at similar conditions to 2016. So, low-single digit growth. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: And the thing across Europe, in Q4 just where certain projects landed in terms of Bioproduction and our BioPharma Services business with more weighted toward Europe than U.S. And those things shift over time, so nothing to read into the performance in Europe in Q4. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, I would agree. I would say from an outlook perspective, we would assume that over time the U.S. is going to get a little bit stronger and Europe is probably going to be slightly more muted in terms of our outlook for the year. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then I think one of the things you touched on at our conference in January was taking more price actions this year. Can you maybe just talk about how you're thinking about pricing? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. So with the strengthening of the dollar, certainly in markets where there's not strong local competition, we've been taking actions. We had done that in Japan a couple years ago. Benefited from that and we're doing that in additional markets where we have the opportunity to do so. We took some of those actions in the UK and continue to do so just given how the pound has been. So those are some of the things. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then I guess last one on capital deployment. Just wondering if you can characterize the M&A funnel. You did talk a lot about the buyback that you did in December and the ones you have planned for this year. But wondering on the M&A front what you're seeing out there and if there's still interesting assets you're looking at? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Well, there are. I mean, the funnel is busy and pretty full. We continue to look at a variety of opportunities. As you know, the industry is incredibly fragmented. So we follow our strategy of looking at things that will strengthen the company strategically, clearly be understood and valued by our customers and create shareholder value, with the primary metric being return on invested capital. While we don't assume any in our guidance because you never know what will ultimately get over the finish line, we feel good about what the pipeline looks like. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Tycho. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg of UBS. Please go ahead. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Thanks a million. And congratulations on a solid end of the year. So, Marc, maybe \u2013 you guys are very diversified across kind of all metrics. Your target range is 4% to 6%. You're saying industrial is getting a little bit better. I guess as you think about it big picture, to get you up to that 5% to 6%, what would you need to see in 2017? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So in terms of the drivers in the end markets to get to higher organic growth, I would say obviously Industrial and Applied would be one. Obviously, coming in at the higher end of the range in the BioPharma, given the range we've assumed there, would ultimately do that. And then the other area is going to be academic and government. It has really been very low-single digits for several years, and that's probably 1 point below the long-term historical trend line. So there's some growth embedded there as well. And the 4% to 6%, as we mentioned, is the long-term outlook. So any particular year, Jon, it's going to vary, but we've been solidly in that range for a number of years. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then I guess bigger picture, Marc, one of the things that seems pretty obvious is that the new administration in the U.S., and who knows what happens in some of the other regions, there's just a lot of change that's coming. Maybe it's difficult to predict what that change is. I know your philosophy and your track record is it's your job to manage through all that change. Is there anything that you see on the horizon that you're particularly focused on that you think might impact your own strategy through all of this? I'm just trying to get an understanding of how you're thinking about everything that's going on. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So we read every change through the lens of our customers and how we're going to help our customers navigate the new opportunities and any challenges that they may face. And when there's periods of any type of inflection point, we've done a good job of strengthening our relationships with our customers and growing our share. And when I think about the specific things for us, obviously tax policy, as Stephen mentioned, should be a nice benefit for us as that gets enacted. So we're paying attention to that as probably the one that's most immediate and affects us. Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: You're welcome. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Jon. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. This is Chris on for Doug today. Thanks for taking my question. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Sure. Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Marc, I was curious if you could provide some more commentary on innovation. I think you have some commentary on new product contributions in your Annual Proxy Statement. But ahead of that, I was curious if you could just help quantify the new product impact in 2016 and how you would think about contributions in 2017? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. So, Chris, thanks for the question. So innovation has been a good year. We finished ahead of our internal goals in terms of the impact for innovation in the year 2016. We use a variety of metrics to measure that, but felt like performance was good. We have some big areas of investment that we're focused on that will drive really good growth into the future. I would categorize them in the areas of Mass spectrometry and broadening the application of that technology. The expansion of our next-gen sequencing further and further into the clinical space, we've had good momentum there. And we're extremely excited about the structural biology applications that FEI brings us and the combination with our leading position in mass spec, So those are some of the things that when I look at what are likely to be continuous good growth drivers for us going forward based on innovation, that's some of the highlights. Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Actually, I just have a related question, and I think you've noted (48:55) both of them. We have been curious about the potential impact of new products, such as NGS assays and mass spec, specifically in Specialty Diagnostics and how that can improve the growth rate in that segment going forward. So I was wondering if you could provide any commentary there on improving the Specialty Diagnostics growth outlook? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Sure. So in terms of the growth in Specialty Diagnostics, it's been operating just below the company average for a period of time. We have a fairly large program in clinical mass spectrometry and that's something that we are targeting to have an impact in 2018. And that, obviously, when we launch and when it drives adoption, should be a nice tailwind for that part of our business. Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Steve, are you there? Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me now? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yep. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Sorry about that. Just looking to fill in the picture here a bit on two things. One, Marc, in genetics and genomics, your tone there has been really positive for some time. And, of course, now with Affymetrix, you have a fuller toolkit, if you will. I wonder if you could just level set us a little bit to help us from a modeling perspective. In the clinical sequencing business, any way you'd be able to size that for us, given where we are here? And you mentioned really strong growth there. How strong is the growth, what are we talking about? And then on the Affymetrix side, how have you seen the growth at Affymetrix, or the legacy Affymetrix business progress since the completion of the deal? And how are you thinking about those businesses for 2017? Thanks. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So, Steve, thanks for the questions. So we obviously have a strong competitive position in our genomics offering from the only company having Sanger sequencing, qPCR, Next-Gen Sequencing and Microarrays within the portfolio. So let's start with the clinical Next-Gen Sequencing. That's a business that has grown in the teens for us and continues to progress very well, so at least gives you a sense. From the Affymetrix integration, let me give you an update there. The integration has gone very smoothly. The eBioscience's business portion, which is complementary to our Biosciences position, is growing very well. And it was encouraging to see in the fourth quarter some stabilization of the Microarray business. Still below our expectations from the beginning of the year, but clearly a nice set of momentum from the actions we put in place during the course of the year. So I feel better about that. And we're looking forward to a strengthening year in the Affymetrix business in 2017. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I really appreciate all the color. Thanks, Marc. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: You're welcome, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, guys. Thank you. Wanted to spend a little bit more time on the BioPharma outlook for this year. Obviously a lot of concern out there, just given how strong those market have been for everybody last couple of years. And you covered some of that in the prepared comments. But I was hoping maybe you could speak a little bit about how you think about visibility between the R&D side of BioPharma versus Bioproduction. Obviously, you got good exposure in both halves. But if you could talk a little bit about the process you went through when you set your 2017 guidance and handicapping the R&D versus production outlook, that be helpful. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Sure. So, Isaac, in our mix, we have roughly a $1 billion Bioproduction business. Been a very strong grower. It's a bit lumpy. But the growth is very strong. And when we look at the outlook for this full year, it continues to be very robust. The reason for that is as you move through the R&D process into production to the ramp of production, those products are very life science tools \u2013 consumption is very intensive. So as volume grows, you really do consume a lot of product relative to a small molecule, which is once you get it into production, really you're just down to the Chromatography for QA/QC. So that's a tailwind that should be with us for the long term in terms of the growth in that part of the business. In terms of the research and development portions of the business and visibility, you never have perfect visibility. But generally, based on the strength of the customer relationships that we have and the access that we have to the customer base, our takeaway is that this is an end market where we're very well positioned to continue to drive meaningful growth. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And then just a follow up on a couple product specifics. One is on FEI. Obviously that's been a nice acquisition from a technology standpoint. And then I think at the same time, the end markets, as you mentioned, in structural biology have started to pick up. So can you talk little bit about where we are in terms of recognizing the orders that you have in structural biology? Is that an uptick that we should expect to continue throughout the course of 2017, or is it really going to be more about the first half of the year? And then second to that would be Affymetrix. If you could help us level set how growth in that business settled out for 2016 and what your expectation is for this year. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. So in terms of FEI, it is an incredibly strong fit with our company and probably one of the most under-appreciated things if I think about in terms of what we did last year and in terms of how that will create a very bright future for the company. When I look at the momentum in structural biology and the orders and the shipments, the business should grow well this year. Obviously, most of the year does not count in our organic growth calculation just because we don't do it until the anniversary. But the business in aggregate should grow above the company average and, last year, certainly had bookings well in excess of their revenue. So a very strong outlook from that perspective. In terms of Affymetrix, we're expecting the business to grow around the company average, maybe slightly better in 2017. So thank you, Isaac. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Operator, we have time for just one more. Operator : Yes. Your last question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning, thanks. Just wanted to follow up on the Specialty Diagnostics growth drivers there with two quick ones. First is just on contributions from the collaborations such as what you are doing with Siemens. What should we expect out of those? And then the second is whether you feel like some of the things that could maybe give the portfolio a deeper reach will be meaningful to growth this year? I think your PCP assay got cleared for broader use. I think you've signed some licensing deals there. So how might those contribute? Thanks very much. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question. So in terms of our position in Specialty Diagnostics, we really have a unique position because we are large partner to each of the OEM companies in the field. So customers like Siemens and Roche are important customers and collaborators with us. One of the interesting areas of growth for us has really been in the sepsis biomarker, PCT. The additional clearances in the U.S. should be a nice tailwind for that business, as not only did we get the clearance on our platform as did a number of our partners. So that should drive further adoption in the U.S., where originally it was usually for a single test and now it's used for monitoring a patient with sepsis, which allows for a larger recurring revenue stream. So we're excited about those opportunities. So thank you for the question. Let me just conclude with a quick comment. As a company and as a team, we're very pleased to delivered strong 2016. We're very well positioned to achieve our growth goals for the years ahead. And certainly I want to thank each of you for your support for Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Ken, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our Q1 call. We accomplished a lot in the quarter, and we had a great start to the year. We delivered strong financial performance on both the top- and bottom-line. We had a very productive quarter for innovation across our businesses. We continued our strong growth momentum in Asia-Pacific, and we enhanced our customer value proposition with two strategic bolt-on acquisitions while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Our team executed well to deliver a strong Q1, and we're well positioned to deliver another excellent year. I'll cover each of these highlights in my remarks, starting with our financial results. We delivered excellent adjusted EPS growth in Q1, with a 16% increase to $2.08 per share. Our revenue in Q1 grew 11% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income increased 16%, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 90 basis points to 22.6%. So we clearly had a great start to the year. Turning now to our performance by end market, in pharma and biotech, we continued to see good growth and our performance in Q1 was in the high-single-digits. The combination of good market fundamentals and the strength of our unique value proposition continues to drive demand from these customers. We had another strong quarter in our bioproduction business, and we also saw strong demand for our biosciences products. Our performance in academic and government end markets in Q1 was similar to what we saw last year and we grew in the low-single-digits. In health care and diagnostics, conditions really haven't changed since last year, and we grew in the low-single-digits in this end market as well. Last, in industrial and applied, we grew at the company average. Applied markets continued to be strong, and we saw good growth in our research and safety market channel with industrial customers. Now let me turn to our growth strategy and touch on some of the great progress we made in Q1 to position Thermo Fisher for an even stronger future. As you know, our growth strategy is based on three pillars : developing high-impact, innovative new products; leveraging our scale in Asia-Pacific and emerging markets; and delivering our unique customer value proposition. I'll start with innovation, and we got off to a strong start here as well with new products launched across our technology portfolios. Let me highlight a few of them. In Analytical Instruments, the new Thermo Scientific products we showcased at Pittcon really emphasized the success of our R&D strategy in this part of the business, which is essentially twofold. First, we continued to strengthen our leading mass spectrometry and chromotography platforms. And a good example of that was our new iCAP triple-quad mass spec system for clinical research in pharma QA/QC. This is an extension of our successful iCAP product line and combines high-powered analysis with simpler operation. Second, we're using these advanced systems to create specific workflows that are powerful yet easy for our customers to use in applications ranging from pharma compliance to clinical research. The new iCAP system allows customers to switch between single and triple-quad modes so they can keep their existing workflow as well as add new capabilities over time. In our Laboratory Products business, we launched a novel cloud-based application that connects electronic pipettes among individual users in the lab. It's designed to enable centralized programming, storage and sharing of protocols which increases efficiency in what has traditionally been a tedious and inefficient process that's prone to human error. This new product is a great example of how we leverage our deep applications knowledge to help our customers improve efficiency at all stages of their workflows. We were also pleased to learn in the quarter that our TSX Series blood bank refrigerators were recognized by the EPA as the first ENERGY STAR certified lab-grade refrigerators currently available in the market. This demonstrates our commitment to offering customers new technologies that meets their goals for sustainability as well as productivity. In Genetic Sciences, where our strategy is to extend the menu of assays that run on our instruments, we launched the CarrierScan Assay. The new microarray-based solution detects more than 6,000 genomic variations associated with 600 inherited diseases. CarrierScan is the first pan-ethnic research assay, which means it can serve as a single solution for an increasingly diverse population that helps labs greatly accelerate the screening process. Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy, Asia-Pacific and emerging markets, we had another strong quarter in this region. China led the way again, with growth in the high teens, and we also reported strong growth in India and South Korea. Our strategy of leveraging our unique scale in (sic) [is] (7:43) driving growth across the region. And we continue to build on our industry-leading presence there as well. A quick note on China. I spent time with a number of our customers there a few weeks ago, and I continue to be energized by the long-term prospects for this important end market and the incredible opportunities we have to continue to gain share. The funding environment overall in China continues to be very positive. And we're well-positioned to lead in several areas that are a high priority for the government, such as precision medicine, pharmaceutical production, and environmental monitoring. While I was there, I participated in the opening of a new customer demo laboratory for cryo-electron microscopy at Tsinghua University, one of the world's premier academic institutions. The lab was built by the University to train China's top scientists in the use of these highly sophisticated tools, including our Titan Krios system, the gold standard for structural biology. At the new lab, we're also sponsoring research and educating students through hands-on cryo-EM courses provided by our experts. Understanding the structure of proteins in our blood is a key to advancing precision medicine. And our cryo-EM and Orbitrap platforms are essential to this research. As you recall, cryo-EM is a powerful technology that we added through our acquisition of FEI. One of our key strategic objectives in acquiring FEI is to use our leadership in life sciences to drive adoption of this technology with those customers. Our collaboration with Tsinghua University is a great example of how we're leveraging our leading presence to achieve this goal. I'll make a quick comment on our progress with FEI, now that it's been part of Thermo Fisher for about six months. The integration is going very well. The technologies are fantastic. And we're thrilled to have the FEI team as part of the company. In terms of financial performance, we're running ahead of the year one accretion target that we articulated at the time of the acquisition. This is driven by both the contribution of synergies and the strong growth of the FEI business. Longer term, we're on track to deliver our year three synergy targets. And we look forward to the new growth opportunities we have now that FEI is part of our company. Turning to the last pillar of our growth strategy, our customer value proposition. In the first quarter we completed two bolt-on acquisitions that strengthen our offering in areas with great long-term growth potential for us, bioproduction and digital science. In bioproduction we acquired Finesse Solutions, a leader in the development of scalable measurement and control capabilities. These proprietary universal systems can be integrated seamlessly with our single-use technologies to further optimize the bioproduction workflow. We continue to increase our bioproduction capabilities and capacity to build on our strong momentum in this high-growth market. The other opportunity I want to highlight is the emerging trend towards the digital lab. To add to our capabilities here, we acquired a small but well-respected company called Core Informatics. Core provides a leading cloud-based information management platform that's used in a range of applications from biopharma and genomics to applied markets and manufacturing. This is a scalable platform that complements our existing informatics offering. It's another step in our strategy to develop new digital solutions that support the way our customers want to work, connecting instruments, data, and scientific expertise. Let me give you a quick summary of our capital deployment activities so far this year. We had a busy Q1 including strategic M&A, stock buybacks, and dividends. And in April, we continued to deploy our capital, buying back an additional $250 million of our shares. So at this point we've deployed just over $1.1 billion of our capital year-to-date. Let me now turn to our guidance for 2017. As you saw in our press release, we're raising our guidance to reflect our strong Q1 performance, a slightly more favorable FX environment, and the recent acquisitions we completed. Stephen will cover the details. But at a high level, we're raising our revenue guidance to a new range of $19.51 billion to $19.71 billion, which would now result in 7% to 8% growth over 2016. In terms of our adjusted EPS, we're raising our guidance to a new range of $9.12 to $9.28 for 2017, for 10% to 12% growth over 2016. Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize our takeaways from Q1. First, we delivered strong financial performance on the top and bottom line. We also continued to strengthen our position with strategic investments in innovation, emerging markets, and our customer value proposition. We feel good about our strong start to the year. And we're confident we'll deliver another excellent year in 2017. With that I'm going to hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll take you through our first quarter results for the total company. I'll then provide some color on our four business segments, and conclude with our updated 2017 guidance. Before I get into the details, let me start with a high-level view of how the first quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. We delivered 4% organic growth in Q1 which was approximately one point higher than we had expected at the midpoint of our previous guidance. This was driven by strong operational execution during the quarter. From an earnings standpoint, we finished $0.06 higher in Q1 than we'd assumed in the midpoint of our initial guidance. This was primarily driven by the pull-through on the additional point of organic growth and a stronger-than-expected contribution from the FEI acquisition. So we're clearly off to a great start to the year. Now let me give you more color on the quarter. Starting with our total company financial performance for Q1, as you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 16% to $2.08. And GAAP EPS was $1.40, up 39% from Q1 last year. On the top-line, our reported revenue grew 11% year-over-year. The components of our Q1 reported revenue included 4% organic growth, 8% growth from acquisitions, and a 1% headwind from foreign exchange. Looking at growth by geography in Q1, North America grew in the low-single-digits while Europe grew in the mid-single-digits. Asia-Pacific grew in the low-double-digits with continued momentum in China, which grew in the high-teens, and Rest of the World was flat organically for the quarter. Turning to our operational performance, Q1 adjusted operating income increased 16% and adjusted operating margin was 22.6%, up 90 basis points from Q1 of last year. Looking at the components of our adjusted operating margin performance in Q1, we achieved solid expansion from our organic growth driven by strong contributions from our PPI Business System and volume leverage and this is partially offset by strategic investments and the expected modest headwind from acquisitions. Foreign exchange did not have a material impact on operating margin during the quarter. Moving onto the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 49.3% in Q1, up 110 basis points from the prior year. The increase in gross margin in Q1 is primarily attributed to the positive impact of our PPI Business System and acquisitions; this is partially offset by strategic investments. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 22.2% of revenue, which is 20 basis points favorable to Q1 2016 and R&D expense came in at 4.5% of revenue, up 40 basis points versus Q1 last year. And R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q1 was 6.8%, up from 6.4% in Q1 2016, primarily due to the impact of the FEI acquisition. Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense was $117 million, up $22 million from Q1 2016, mainly as a result of incremental debt financing to support our capital deployment actions over the past year. Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense in the quarter of $5 million which is $4 million more of an expense than 2016, driven primarily by changes in non-operating foreign exchange. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14% flat to last year, just slightly higher than the expected full-year tax rate of 13.3% due to the timing of discrete tax line items within 2017. The average diluted shares were 394.1 million, down 4.6 million year-over-year, mainly result of the buybacks, partially offset by option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations through Q1 was $360 million and free cash flow was $270 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $90 million. Free cash flow is $45 million favorable to Q1 2016. We ended the quarter with $715 million in cash and investments. As for capital deployment activities, we had a busy quarter. And as you heard from Marc, we closed two bolt-on acquisitions, Finesse Solutions and Core Informatics. We also completed a total of $500 million of share buybacks in Q1 and returned $60 million to shareholders through dividends. As Marc also mentioned earlier in Q2, we also completed an incremental $250 million of share buybacks. That brings us to $750 million of share buybacks for the year, which is right in line with our previous guidance. Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $17.1 billion, up $500 million sequentially from Q4, mainly driven by the increase in short-term debt relating to our acquisition and share repurchase activities. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.6 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA. And wrapping up my comments on our total company performance, ROIC improved once again in the quarter, our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC at the end of Q1 was 10%, up 10 basis points sequentially from Q4 and up 40 basis points over Q1 2016. So we continue to see good underlying performance in this metric. So now I'll provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Starting with Life Sciences Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 12% in Q1 and organic revenue grew at 7%. In the quarter, we continued to see strong growth across all four of our businesses in this segment, bioproduction, next-generation sequencing, genetic sciences, and biosciences. Q1 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 31.8%, up 290 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw strong productivity, volume pull-through and favorable business mix, partially offset by strategic investments and the dilutive impact of acquisitions. In the Analytical Instruments segment, which includes the FEI acquisition, reported revenue increased 39% in Q1 and organic growth was 5%. In the quarter, we had strong growth in our chromatography and mass spec businesses. Q1 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments grew 72% and adjusted operating margin was 18.2%, up 350 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw good volume leverage, strong productivity and a positive impact from the FEI acquisition. This was partially offset by strategic investments and foreign exchange. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics segment, in Q1, total revenue grew 1% and organic revenue growth was 2%. We saw good growth in our clinical diagnostics business. Adjusted operating increased 2% in Q1 and adjusted operating margin was 27%, up 10 basis points from Q1 at the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was positively affected by good productivity, volume pull-through, and favorable FX, offset partially by strategic investments. Finally, in the Lab Products and Services segment, Q1 reported revenue increased 3% and organic revenue growth was 4%. In the quarter, we had strong growth in both our Channel and Laboratory Products businesses. Adjusted operating income in this segment decreased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 12.7%, down 170 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin benefited from both volume leverage and productivity; however, this was more than offset by the expected impact of unfavorable business mix by the Biopharma Services business and, to a lesser extent, strategic investments. So now I'll review the details of our updated full-year 2017 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance. We're increasing revenue guidance by $110 million at the midpoint and increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 at the midpoint. Let me walk you through the details, starting with revenue. We continue to expect to deliver 4% organic revenue growth for the full-year 2017. Of the $110 million increase in revenue guidance at the midpoint, $50 million reflects a slightly less adverse foreign-exchange environment, and $60 million reflects the expected increase in contribution from acquisitions, principally the addition of Finesse Solutions and Core Informatics, as well as an increase in the revenue outlook for FEI. And in terms of adjusted earnings per share, the $0.05 increase at the midpoint of our guidance reflects $0.02 dilution from the Core Informatics acquisition, a $0.04 benefit from improved operational performance, and a $0.03 benefit from less-adverse FX environment. And finally, with one quarter of strong performance behind us, we're narrowing our revenue guidance range to $200 million and narrowing our adjusted earnings per share range to $0.16. So to sum all this up, the revised 2017 revenue guidance is now a range of $19.51 billion to $19.71 billion. That would represent 7% to 8% growth versus 2016. We expect acquisitions to contribute just over 4.5% to our reported revenue growth in 2017, and FX is expected to be a headwind of just under 1.5%. In terms of earnings per share, our increased 2017 guidance is now a range of $9.12 to $9.28 with a midpoint of $9.20. This represents growth of 10% to 12% versus 2016. Excluding the negative impact of FX, this would represent adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%. A few other details behind revised 2017 guidance. We're assuming that foreign exchange is now a $250 million revenue headwind for 2017, or just under 1.5%. The FX headwind on adjusted earnings per share is now assumed to be $0.17 or just over 2%. We expect acquisitions will contribute just over 4.5% to our reported revenue growth in 2017 and $0.31 of adjusted earnings per share increase year-over-year. We continue to expect 40 to 60 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year, consistent with our prior guidance. We're expecting net interest expense to be about $450 million, which is at the high-end of our previous range, primarily as a result of the incremental debt financing for acquisitions we completed in Q1. We're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be 13.3% for the year, consistent with the previous guidance. And as a reminder, this does not include the benefit of any potential tax reform that may occur in the U.S. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance continues to assume $750 million of share buybacks in 2017, and these have all been fully executed. We continue to assume to return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends, and our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures. We're assuming net capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million; no change from the previous guidance. We're still expecting about $3.15 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2017, consistent with previous guidance. And full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 393 million to 394 million, also consistent with previous guidance. And finally, in terms of phasing we're expecting organic growth to be relatively even over the remainder of the year. And for adjusted EPS we expect that it'd be phased across the remaining nine months of the year in a similar way to the same period in 2016. As always in interpreting our revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoints as the most likely view of how we see results playing out. So in summary we executed well in Q1, and we're well-positioned to achieve our goals for the year. With that I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Derik. How are you? Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good. So lot of questions, but I'll limit it to one just in the spirit of things. So some of your competitors were talking about some weakness in the U.S. pharma businesses. It doesn't look like that materialized for you. Could you just talk a little bit about that environment? And I guess the commentary on the LPS margin being offset by the mix of biopharma services, is that \u2013 could you elaborate a little bit more on that in terms of what you're seeing on that one? Then I've got a follow-up. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Sure. Derik, thanks for the question. At a high-level, when I think about the quarter, obviously a very good start to the year. And the team executed well, serving all of the markets. We came out of the quarter very confident with the 4% organic growth guidance that we outlined back in January. In terms of the color around pharma and biotech, it was a good quarter. It was once again our strongest end market. As I mentioned, it grew in the high single digits. In addition to the strength in bioproduction and biosciences, we also had good strength from chromatography and mass spectrometry. So really a good quarter. As Stephen mentioned in the LPS segment, you saw margin dilution. That was really driven by something we expected in our biopharma services business, which was at the end, in Q4, one of our customers canceled a large Phase III study, a very public one. It had nothing to do with us. The study itself was canceled. And that was a good-sized contract and a profitable piece of business. So it shows up really more in the margin profile within LPS. And we'll sunset that after the third quarter of this year. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So that was the clinical trial logistics business, right? That... Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Exactly. Correct. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. All right. And then... Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: A single study that was canceled, basically. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks for the color on that. And I guess as you \u2013 have you noticed any sort of slowdown or hesitation in the academic labs? It doesn't look like it based on your 7% LSS number. But I would love some commentary on that. Then I'll shut up. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Well, you don't have to shut up. But from the quarter, academic and government was low single digits, very similar to what we've been seeing in recent quarters; Asia-Pacific being strongest. In terms of the U.S. academic and government, we grew slightly. And we would have expected by this point to be operating with a budget as opposed to under a continuing resolution. So we didn't see really significant change. If you get into the details of the U.S. academic and government, consumables was stronger than instrumentation. But again in aggregate, a low-level of growth in the U.S. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Derik. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Thanks. Nice quarter, guys. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thank you, Tycho. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Maybe starting with FEI, obviously the commentary there pretty constructive. Can you talk a little bit on demand trends for cryo-EM adoption and interest you're seeing from pharma? It sounds like you're starting to bundle a little bit with Orbitrap per your commentary. And then separately on the semi-side of that business, can you talk a little bit about how much you're seeing a pickup there? I guess what I'm getting at is, in prior cycles that business can be kind of high single digit or double digit at the right point of the cycle. So just wondering what the inflection point looks like for that business. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Tycho, thanks for the question. Good chance to just talk about FEI broadly. First, from an integration perspective, going very well. Really a fabulous team and very good complement to our company. In terms of the growth performance, we had a very strong quarter within FEI. And we're expecting to have very strong growth. As you know, because we won't anniversary it until the very end of the third quarter, it's not going to be meaningful contributor to our organic growth. But on a pro forma basis, the business is growing very well. When you look at the pieces of the business, the life sciences portion of the business, which is driven by cryo-EM, is going incredibly strongly and there's excellent interest both in the academic community as well as you're seeing the beginning of interest in the pharmaceutical community as well. We've had some orders put in place, we also had, importantly, those customers kind of sharing some of the academic instruments, doing some studies which shows their interest and, ultimately, we think that they'll become purchasers as well. So that's very strong growth. Material science, which incorporates all of the non-life-sciences, semiconductor, academic, material science, oil and gas, every single thing that's not life sciences within the FEI business had very strong bookings growth in the quarter. Revenue growth was more muted in aggregate, but that will pick up as the year goes on, and that's driven by semiconductor being very strong on the bookings side. So a very encouraging first six months of the integration and we feel very good about the FEI business and how we'll add value to it and how it will add value to Thermo Fisher Scientific. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then maybe for a follow-up, just on industrial commentary in general, you talked about research and safety doing pretty well, I think last quarter you've made some comments about metals and mining picking up. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about incrementally relative to last quarter where you've seen some improvement? And we have heard some peers about more of a pickup in Asia industrial as well. So just wondering if you could comment on that, too. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, of course. Thanks, Tycho. So as I mentioned in the beginning, industrial and applied grew at about the company average for the quarter. Applied markets were good. Industrial clearly is progressing as we had talked about last quarter. So when you look at the pieces, the shorter cycle portions of the business and the channel reflects that as would some of the lower purchase price, lower aggregate priced instrumentation, had a good quarter in terms of growth and what was also encouraging is that bookings were continuing to grow in the longer cycle products, the things that we mentioned last quarter. So that's two quarters in a row of bookings growth there, and that bodes well for the industrial end markets to play out in line with the expectations that we had articulated back in January, which is growth around the company average, and that would be a nice improvement over what we had seen over the last few years. So that's encouraging. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Tycho. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is now open. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning. What assumptions are embedded into full year guidance for revenue growth by end market and geography? And how have they have changed, if at all, relative to what you embedded into guidance coming into the year? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, I'll take that one. So, Doug, nothing much has really changed when we look at it by end market from where we were at the beginning of the year. Some minor puts and takes across it. So biopharma will still be the strongest grower, expecting that to be kind of mid-to high-single-digits. Industrial and applied, as Marc said, would be about company average, and diagnostics and health care, and academic and government would be about kind of low-single-digits for 2017, same as 2016. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, Stephen. And... Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: From a geographic... Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Oh, go ahead, sorry. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: From a geographic standpoint, Doug, Asia-Pacific, really no significant changes from the guidance back in January. Asia-Pacific, by far the strongest, and both Europe and North America just below the company average would be our expectations. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. So just a couple of quick follow-ups. I mean, it does seem like pharma is holding up at least as well as expected, if not better, NIH uncertainty doesn't seem to be hitting you and you already had low expectations for that end market and industrial seems to be tracking a smidge ahead of plan. You beat your Q1 expectations as you indicated in your prepared remarks. But why not bump up organic revenue guidance a bit based on all of these observations? Is it just a function of being early in the year and wanting to have a little bit more confidence before making any changes? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, you know Doug, it's a good question. The way that we think about it is twofold. First, it is a bit early in the year, and, well, obviously we're encouraged by the good execution in Q1, so it's a bit early to make changes on that. The second thing is one of the assumptions that's embedded in the guidance both in January, in particular was that we would be operating with a U.S. budget and, obviously, that budget that's been talked about is going to have a nice increase for NIH funding. Obviously we're sitting here at the end of April and we're still under continuing resolution. So that's something that we're just paying attention to and, obviously, three days ago, the news was discouraging, this morning the news is encouraging, and we just look forward to actually going from continuing resolution to budget and that can be a positive as the year unfolds. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And one last follow-up on this topic. Marc, you have better visibility than many if not most of your peers given the size of your business in China and how much time you spend there. Do you have any sense if there's stimulus-like activities or anything else that might be contributing to outsized growth in the near-term? Really what I'm getting at is it doesn't sound like you have any concerns about the sustainability of recent strong trends in China. I just want to make sure you haven't picked up on anything that would change your conviction on the durability of trends. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: No, when I was in China at the beginning of April, where we're seeing this excellent, excellent activity is very much aligned with the five-year plan. It's not a stimulus-driven thing. It's really around precision medicine. We had a great interaction with a number of thought leaders there, and they're very aligned with what we're doing and obviously in food safety, environmental and the expansion of healthcare. Those were really core parts of the five-year plan in China. So we're not \u2013 we hadn't heard much about, if any, about a short-term stimulus effect but rather really alignment with fundamental government priorities. So we think we're very well positioned and, obviously, have a very strong team there. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks again. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Doug. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is now open. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Jack. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I wanted to start digging on mass spec and chromatography. You talked about the nice growth there. I was just wondering if any of the underlying drivers have changed. And, Marc, do you have any updated views on the clinical opportunity? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, Jack, good questions. From the chroma, mass spec area, we continue to drive good growth. We saw strong performance in our high-end mass spectrometers, the Orbitrap family in particular was very strong, chromatography was quite strong across the board, so there wasn't anything that particularly jumped out as something special. Obviously, the applied markets in Asia helped drive some of the growth, but we saw a really widespread adoption across the business. So that perspective we feel good about. In terms of our clinical mass spec, a program that something we're targeting for a launch in 2018 and we're looking forward to it. As we get to some of the upcoming conferences, ASMS, in terms of the research market, you'll see some really exciting launches. And in AACC, you'll get some more views on what we're doing in the clinical space. So this late spring and summer will be super-exciting for Thermo Fisher Scientific as well. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, looking forward to it. And then just wanted to follow-up on the margins in Analytical Instruments, maybe for Stephen, up 350 bps. I know some of this is mix, but how much leverage do you think you can drive here with better top-line performance through the year? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. So roughly half of the margin expansion really came from the FEI acquisition. The rest came from the core business. So there is good volume pull-through and using our PPI Business System, we think we can drive significant leverage of additional revenue. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Jack. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Steve. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just two quick ones, one for Marc and one for Stephen. Marc, during the quarter, there's been some, I suppose, up and down in terms of sentiment and expectations around bioprocess, clearly, a good quarter for you guys. It's an interesting business relative to the business overall, in part because it's a very long-cycle business. I would think you have a good degree of visibility in terms of capital projects and capacity plans for your customer base. It'd just be helpful, given all the questions out there, for you to give us a sense of what you're hearing from the customer base in terms of how they're thinking about capacity needs and what that means for the business. And then one quick one for Stephen. Look, really good quarter on the margin front, right? 90 basis points and guidance is still for 40 to 60 basis points. Can you just help us understand why, over the balance of the year, we might expect to see some moderation in the year-on-year trend? Or is this another case where we're just taking kind of a wait-and-see approach given how early it is in the year? Thanks a bunch. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. I'll take the margin one first. So we delivered 90 basis points of expansion in Q1. For the full-year, we're still \u2013 I reiterated 40 to 60 basis points with a midpoint of 50 basis points. So if you do the math, we would be delivering just under 40 basis points for the remainder of the year, on average. A couple of key drivers between that and the Q1 expansion : timing of investments, more loaded into Q2 and Q3, a little bit in Q4; and then the other piece is that we had a very profitable stub period in Q3 last year from the FEI acquisition. We had a lot of revenue and very little cost, so that's causing a little bit of pressure on the Q3 margin. But overall, 50 basis points for the year. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Steve, in terms of bioprocess, really a very strong fundamental end market. And we have a very, very strong competitive position. So we've had good growth for a number of years in that business. Q1 was a good quarter for us as well, with high growth as well. As a reminder, we have leadership positions in the media used to grow the product. And then obviously in terms of the single-use technologies that the products are made in, we have market leadership positions. We're excited about the Finesse acquisition, because it complements our single-use technologies. We've been expanding our capacity in terms of our manufacturing plants over the last few years. And we've had a number of openings, both in Grand Island and in Inchinnan in Scotland, where the customer feedback has been incredibly positive. So we feel good about the underlying aspects. There's always some lumpiness in the business, so we don't over-read that too much. I mean, yes, you have a lot of visibility. But sometimes shipments happen in one quarter, move to the next quarter. But for us, we've had pretty smooth growth over the last few years. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks a bunch. Have a good morning. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, guys. I just want to dig a little bit more into the organic growth assumptions by division for the rest of the year. And starting with Diagnostics, I mean you had a pretty tough comp in the first quarter, so that's understandable. But as we think about the rest of the year, is it fair to assume that the organic growth will pick up? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So in terms of what was in our initial guidance and still in our revised current guidance, Life Sciences Solutions will be the fastest-growing segment that we have. Analytical Instruments will be about the company average. Lab Products and Services will be slightly higher than company average. And Diagnostics will be similar to what we saw last year, is the way we're thinking about that. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's helpful. And then just in terms of LPS, if I think about the overall end market, you guys went through the various customer segments. I'm curious about just market share trends. Where do you feel like you're executing the best in terms of share gains in LPS? Where could you be doing better? Thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, when I look at the three sub-components of Lab Products and Services, you have the channel business, you have our manufacturing business for lab products, which is basically when you walk through a lab, kind of everything you see, the plastics, the equipment, the refrigeration, all of that. And you have our clinical trials logistics, or what we call biopharma services. I actually think all three teams executed very well in the quarter, right? And when I look at the channel business, we had very strong growth in the channel business. Really both in North America and Europe, the business is doing very well. Lab Products had a very strong start to the year in terms of growth. And when I look at the biopharma services business, the activity excluding sort of the one large trial that a customer discontinued, I feel good about the execution there. And then obviously that's going to take a few quarters to sunset. So I don't think there was areas that we under-executed. But we always try to be better, right? And our goal is to continue to drive additional growth, and our teams are focused on that. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks, guys. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Isaac. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citi. Your line is now open. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thank you. Marc, maybe just back on FEIC. Can you just talk a bit about where you are in the new product cycle there? When you guys did the deal, Don [Kania] sounded pretty good on some of the things coming down the pike. So just curious about how much of what you're seeing has to do with new introductions? And then what you think about portfolio additions or refreshes there? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: In terms of where the momentum is coming from currently, it's really the existing range of products. We have some exciting products in the pipeline. So that will help sustain a very bright outlook for the business. But the momentum you see right now is not really being driven by new products, per se. So that's something that will unfold as the year progresses. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then maybe just back on industrial, I'm looking at the developed markets. Can you compare U.S. to Europe? And to the extent that the recovery carries through the year, do you see one of those leading the way versus the other? Or should it be pretty balanced? Thanks. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: I would say that from the industrial, our channel business performed well in both geographies. So we didn't see a big difference versus our expectations there. I would expect pretty balanced improvements in both the U.S. and Europe and encouraging signs in Asia. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a ton. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney. Your line is now open. William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hey, guys. This is actually Bill March on for Paul. How are you doing? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good. William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : First question, if I could, on microarray. Last summer, you talked about seeing some pricing pressure from a competitor in that business. And with the new product launch, just an update on that end market and your channel strategy there. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, so in terms \u2013 Bill, thanks for the question. In terms of the microarray business, we're expecting modest organic growth for 2017 for that business, as we said shortly after the acquisition. The first year of ownership, which we sunsetted in March, was softer for that business, primarily about pricing that the competitor had dropped during the sale process of that business. And we launched a number of products and commercial initiatives, and we expect to see some momentum build as we move through the course of 2017. William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Got it. And then just one question on organic growth in the quarter. Could you give us a sense of what the organic growth was for recurring revenues versus instruments? Just trying to understand the growth dynamics, considering the tough 1Q 2016 comp with the extra week of selling days. Thanks, guys. Have a good one. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Bill. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So the growth was actually good across both instruments and consumables for us. Yeah, so good growth across both areas. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. My first question, Marc, has your outlook on the U.S. changed at all given the discussion of cuts in science funding and also environmental? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. In terms of the outlook for the U.S., not really. Pretty consistent with the original guidance provided we get a budget at some point in time, right? The continuing resolution is probably a month later going on and we had put into our original guidance we would've thought sometime in early April we would move to a budget, something of that standpoint in our original plan. So if that plays out, then the U.S. should be similar to what we thought. In terms of the science funding, Congress continues to be very focused on strong growth and support for NIH in particular. You can see that in the 21st Century Cures, you can see that in the funding for the Cancer Moonshot. I've had the opportunity to be in D.C. and meet with a number of members of leadership and there's strong support there from that perspective. So that's \u2013 that we're focused on making sure that that continues and feel like that's \u2013 it should be okay. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And I know your environmental business is headquartered in China, but nothing to flag on the environmental front? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: No, I thought about that in more detail as we're in the discussion around policy, around the EPA. So obviously the business is primarily driven by activities outside the U.S. in terms of our air monitoring business in particular, primarily in China. In terms of the U.S., the Federal EPA is a tiny customer directly. So truly, hundreds of thousands of dollars, nothing significant. In terms of \u2013 bigger customers are really the states' EPAs that do the monitoring of the air quality and those regulators are typically more stringent than the federal level, so that's encouraging. Longer-term, obviously, a less desire for regulation on EPA is going to be a longer-term headwind for the air quality business. And to frame the magnitude domestically, that business is maybe $50 million, roughly in size. So it's a very small business. Short-term, you don't really see any effect. And with these policies, no new regulations go into effect over the next four years, then obviously that has some longer-term headwinds on that business. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for all the color. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Dan. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Operator, we're going to take one more question. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. Going back to China, you talked about being well-positioned to continue to gain share there. Are there particular areas within your portfolio or particular end markets where you're seeing the most share gains in China or is it more broad-based? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: We've had broad-based success, Catherine, but clearly precision medicine, the food safety, kind of chromatography and mass spectrometry, genetic sciences, businesses have done very well. There's lots of demand and interest in vaccines and pharmaceutical production. That's been good for both our biosciences business and bioproduction. So it's been pretty broad-based but precision medicine, food safety are probably the two areas that jump out the most to us as big opportunities for continued momentum. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks for the question. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So let me wrap up the call. First, thank you for joining us. We're very pleased to have delivered a strong start to the year. We feel we're very well positioned to deliver another great year in 2017. And of course, thanks for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

We made terrific progress in advancing our growth strategy, launching new high-impact products, and achieving strong results in emerging markets. And we continued to effectively deploy our capital, announcing our acquisition of Patheon, which will further strengthen our customer value proposition. Our performance in Q2 contributed to a strong first half, and we're right on track to deliver another great year. I'll cover these highlights in more detail during my remarks, starting with our financial results. First, we delivered another excellent quarter of adjusted EPS growth, with a 13% increase to $2.30 per share. As you know, we have a long track record of consistently delivering strong EPS performance, and we continued that trend in Q2. Our revenue in Q2 grew 10% year over year. Our adjusted operating income increased 13%, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 50 basis points to 23.3%. Our margin expansion reflects the continuous impact of our PPI [Practical Process Improvement] Business System, which is our foundation for operational discipline across the company. PPI creates competitive advantage for Thermo Fisher Scientific by increasing productivity and quality, which ultimately results in stronger customer allegiance. Our PPI Business System is a key driver of profitable growth and is a great playbook for optimizing our existing businesses as well as integrating acquisitions. To summarize the financial results, we achieved another great quarter that led to a strong first half, which puts us where we need to be at the midpoint of the year. Let me give you some color on our performance relative to our end markets. They played out as we expected and in line with our full-year guidance. Pharma and biotech continued to be our strongest end market, with growth in the mid-single digits in Q2. We continue to leverage our unique value proposition with these customers and saw strong performance across our biosciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses, as well as our research and safety market channel. Turning to industrial and applied, we grew here at about the company average in Q2. Similar to last quarter, we saw good demand in our research and safety market channel from industrial customers. And we were encouraged to see a return to growth in our chemical analysis business in the quarter. Applied markets, particularly environmental and food safety, remained strong, as they have for quite some time. In our other two end markets, academic and government and diagnostics and healthcare, conditions were similar in Q2 to what we've been seeing for a number of quarters. We grew in the low single digits in both of these end markets. Now let me turn to some of our many business highlights we had in the quarter. As usual, I'll put them in the framework of our growth strategy, which is centered on developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in Asia-Pacific and emerging markets, and delivering our unique value proposition to our customers. So, starting with innovation, as you will recall, we began the year strong and we increased our momentum in Q2 with a number of significant developments. Let me give you a few examples from the quarter. First, the American Society for Mass Spectrometry is always a great opportunity for us to reinforce our leadership, and we proudly celebrated our 50th anniversary in mass spectrometry this year. The progress we continue to make was very evident at ASMS, and I'll mention a couple of the highlights. For life science researchers, we continued to build our leading Orbitrap platform, raising the bar in both accuracy and speed to accelerate results from proteomics. The newly launched Q Exactive HF-X system was designed to improve analysis of complex biological samples in translational research and biopharma applications. For customers in applied markets, we launched two new Triple Stage Quadrupole systems that improve quantitative workflows in clinical research and forensic toxicology. For example, in our genetic analysis business, we introduced the new SeqStudio Genetic Analyzer. This is a simple to operate, affordable, and cloud-enabled system for customers working in low or mid-throughput genetic laboratories. This launch builds on our leading position across the genetic analysis workflow. Turning to diagnostics, we're very pleased to receive clearance from the U.S. FDA for two important tests that give clinicians the information they need to make better decisions for their patients. First, in a significant development, we were granted pre-market approval for the first companion diagnostic test using next-gen sequencing to screen for non-small-cell lung cancer. Our Oncomine Dx Target Test can simultaneously evaluate 23 genes associated with this disease and identify patients who may be a match for certain treatments. We developed the test in partnership with Novartis and Pfizer, and the goal is to expand its use beyond lung cancer in the future. This is an important milestone in our companywide effort to advance precision medicine and is a great example of the unique capabilities we have to support this global initiative. We also received 510(k) clearance to expand the use of our B.R.A.H.M.S. PCT-sensitive KRYPTOR assay to aid in antibiotic therapy decision-making. What this means is that the assay can help doctors decide when to administer antibiotics to patients with lower respiratory tract infections, or when to safely discontinue antibiotics in those patients. As a specific biomarker for bacterial infection, our PCT test is an effective tool for addressing the challenge of antibiotic resistance. The second element of our growth strategy is to leverage our scale in APAC and emerging markets. The headline here is that we delivered another strong quarter, with both China and India delivering double-digit growth. It's clear that our scale is an important competitive advantage for us, particularly in these regions. We continue to increase our presence in emerging markets, and our teams are effectively leveraging those investments to drive growth. A good example from the quarter comes from the Middle East, where we strengthened our long-term relationship with the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, better known as KAUST. We participated in the opening of the KAUST Center of Excellence for Electron Microscopy, which is a technology we added through our acquisition of FEI. The KAUST collaboration is intended to accelerate research by bringing these highly sophisticated tools to local scientists and industries for applications ranging from nanoparticles to life sciences. I'll also add that our electron microscopy business had strong performance again in Q2. As we approach the anniversary of the FEI acquisition in late September, the integration continues to go very smoothly. We're running ahead of our year one accretion targets, and that's driven by the combination of strong growth and synergies. Longer term, we're on track to deliver our year three synergy targets, and we're beginning to tap the many opportunities we have with FEI to create tremendous value for our customers. That's a good transition to the third element of our growth strategy, which is our customer value proposition. Our agreement to acquire Patheon is the latest example of the significant investments we continue to make to enhance our offering for our customers. We're really excited about the new outsourcing services we'll gain from Patheon, which will allow us to provide comprehensive support for our biopharma customers, from drug development to clinical trials to commercial manufacturing. When I talk to these customers, the feedback has been very positive, and they're eager to explore new opportunities to expand our partnerships. Here's a quick update on the progress we're making as we work towards the close. The integration teams from both companies are well into the planning phase so we can hit the ground running at the time of close. I've been very impressed by the state-of-the-art facilities I've seen and the world-class team I've met during the integration process. We've begun to put financing in place and we're moving through the regulatory process. We're very confident in our ability to close by the end of the year, and look forward to officially welcoming our new Patheon colleagues to Thermo Fisher. Including Patheon, we will have deployed approximately $8.5 billion of capital in 2017. Our successful capital deployment strategy gives us the ability to create significant shareholder value through a combination of strategic M&A, stock buybacks, and dividends. Let me now turn to our guidance for 2017. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the full year. Stephen will cover the detail. But at a high level, we're raising our revenue guidance to a new range of $19.71 billion to $19.89 billion, which will result in 8% to 9% growth over 2016. In terms of our adjusted EPS guidance, we're raising it to a new range of $9.15 to $9.28 for 2017, for 11% to 12% growth over 2016. Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize our key takeaways from Q2. We delivered an excellent quarter, which contributed to a strong first half. We're successfully executing our growth strategy to create long-term value for our customers and shareholders. We're right on track at the midpoint of the year, and that positions us to achieve an excellent 2017. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our second quarter results for the total company, and then I'll provide some color on our four business segments and conclude with our updated 2017 guidance. Before I get into the details, let me start with a high-level view of how the second quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of the last earnings call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered 4% organic growth in Q2, and that was in line with our expectations for the quarter. FX came in about $50 million less of a headwind on revenue than we had expected, but was $0.01 more of a headwind on adjusted EPS due to transactional and non-operating FX losses in the quarter. However, despite the additional FX headwind on adjusted EPS, we were still able to finish $0.04 higher in Q2 than we had assumed at the midpoint of our previous guidance. This is due to excellent operational performance across the company, including strong volume and pull-through from our FEI electron microscopy business, so another quarter of very strong execution. Now let me give you more color on Q2. Starting with our total company financial performance, as you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS in Q2 by 13%, to $2.30. GAAP EPS was $1.56, up 20% from Q2 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 10% year over year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue included 4% organic growth, 8% growth from acquisitions, and a 1% headwind from foreign exchange. Looking at our growth by geography in Q2, North America grew about the company average and Europe grew in the low single digits. Asia-Pacific grew in the high single digits, including mid-teens growth in China, and rest of the world was flat this quarter. Turning to our operational performance, Q2 adjusted operating income increased 13% and adjusted operating margin was 23.3%, up 50 basis points from Q2 of last year. This 50 basis points of expansion was a result of good pull-through from our organic growth, driven by strong contributions from our PPI Business System and volume leverage. This was partially offset by unfavorable business mix, strategic investments, and foreign exchange. Adjusted gross margin came in at 48.3% in Q2. This represents a contraction of 30 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by business mix and foreign exchange, partially offset by strong contributions from our PPI Business System. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 20.6% of revenue, which is 120 basis points favorable to Q2 2016, primarily driven by business mix and the impact of acquisitions. R&D expense came in at 4.4% of revenue, up 40 basis points versus Q2 last year. R&D as a percent of manufacturing revenue increased to 6.7%. This is 50 basis points higher than Q2 2016, primarily due to the impact of FEI's more significant R&D spend. Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense was $116 million, up $10 million from Q2 2016. Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense in the quarter of $7 million, which is $13 million unfavorable versus Q2 2016, which was driven primarily by changes in non-operating foreign exchange. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.1%, which is 40 basis points lower than last year and right in line with our expectations for the quarter. The average diluted shares were 393.3 million, down 3.4 million year over year, mainly as a result of share buybacks, partially offset by option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations for the first half of the year was $1.21 billion, and free cash flow was $1.03 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $180 million. We ended the quarter with $615 million in cash and investments. During Q2, we completed $250 million of share buybacks and paid $60 million in dividends. Our total debt at the end of Q2 was $16.8 billion, down $300 million sequentially from Q1, and our leverage ratio at the end of quarter was 3.4 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA, down from 3.6 times at the end of Q1. And wrapping up comments on our total company performance, we continued to see good year-over-year improvement in ROIC, even net of the impact of recent acquisitions. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC at the end of Q2 was 10%, up 20 basis points over Q2 2016. Now let me provide you some color on the performance of our four business segments. Starting with the Life Sciences Solutions segment, reported revenue and organic revenue both increased 3% in Q2. In the quarter, our biosciences business delivered particularly strong growth. Q2 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 15%, and adjusted operating margin was up 340 basis points year over year to 31.9%. In the quarter, we saw a very strong productivity and volume pull-through, partially offset by business mix, strategic investments, and the dilutive impact of acquisitions. In the Analytical Instruments segment, which includes our new FEI electron microscopy business, reported revenue increased 47% in Q2 and organic revenue growth was 6%. In the quarter, we had strong growth in chromatography and in the mass spec business. And it was encouraging to see the chemical analysis business return to positive growth, as Marc mentioned earlier. Q2 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments grew 61%, and adjusted operating margin was 20%, up 170 basis points year over year. In the quarter, we continued to see a positive impact from the electron microscopy business as well as strong volume leverage and productivity. This was partially offset by FX and strategic investments. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment, in Q2 total revenue grew 1% and organic revenue growth was 2%. Our transplant diagnostics business delivered particularly strong growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating income decreased 1% in Q2 and adjusted operating margin was 27.3%, which represents a contraction of 60 basis points from Q2 of the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was positively impacted by good productivity, but this was more than offset by strategic investments and business mix. Finally, in the Lab Products and Services segment, Q2 reported revenue increased 4% and organic revenue growth was 5%. In the quarter, our channel business delivered particularly strong growth. Adjusted operating income in the segment decreased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 13.8%, down 130 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin benefited from both productivity and volume leverage. However, as expected, this was more than offset by the impact of the unfavorable business mix, driven by our biopharma services business, which was impacted by the discontinuation of a large Phase 3 clinical trial last year, as we mentioned last quarter. With that, I'll now move on to our full-year 2017 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we are raising our guidance. Let me walk you through the details, starting with revenue. We continue to expect to deliver 4% organic revenue growth for full-year 2017. The midpoint of our revenue guidance is increasing $190 million. Of that increase, $160 million reflects a less adverse foreign exchange environment, and $30 million reflects the improvement in the outlook from our FEI acquisition. In terms of adjusted earnings per share, there were two key changes to our guidance. First, we're increasing the midpoint of our guidance by $0.065 to reflect our strong Q2 operational performance and a less adverse FX environment for the year. And second, as you may have seen, we've started the process of securing permanent financing for the Patheon acquisition, and last week we completed a $3 billion European bond offering. For 2017, the interest on this new debt will equate to approximately $0.05 of adjusted earnings per share, and we factored this into our revised guidance. As is our usual practice, our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures, and therefore it does not include Patheon or any related future financing activities. And finally, with another quarter of great performance behind us, we're narrowing our revenue guidance range by $180 million and narrowing our adjusted earnings per share range by $0.13. Summing this all up, the increased 2017 revenue guidance is now a range of $19.71 billion to $19.89 billion, which would represent 8% to 9% growth versus 2016. We expect acquisitions to contribute just under 5% to our reported revenue growth in 2017, and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of $90 million or 0.5%, and as I mentioned previously, 4% organic growth. In terms of adjusted earnings per share, our increased 2017 guidance is now a range of $9.15 to $9.28, with a midpoint of $9.215. This represents growth of 11% to 12% versus 2016. We now expect a headwind from foreign exchange of $0.15 or just under 2%. That is $0.02 less of a headwind than our previous guidance. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, this would represent adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%. A few other details behind our revised 2017 guidance, we now expect 50 to 60 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year over year compared to the 40 to 60 basis points in our previous guidance. Foreign exchange is now a 10 basis point headwind for the year compared to a net neutral in our previous guidance. However, this is being more than offset by the strong operational performance. We're expecting net interest expense to be about $480 million and other income and expense to be a net expense of $12 million. We continue to forecast our adjusted income tax rate to be 13.3% for the year. We've completed $750 million of share buybacks this year. And given the pending acquisition of Patheon, at this point we do not expect any additional buybacks in 2017. We continue to assume we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends in 2017, and full-year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 393 million to 394 million, consistent with our previous guidance. We're assuming net capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million, no change from the previous guidance. And we continue to expect about $3.15 billion of free cash flow for full-year 2017. And finally, in terms of phasing, we're expecting organic growth to be relatively even over the remainder of the year. For adjusted earnings per share, we expect that it will be phased across the remaining six months of the year in a similar way to the same period in 2016. As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view of how we see results playing out. So in summary, we delivered another strong quarter in Q2, which positions us well at the halfway point to achieve our full-year 2017 financial goals. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Stephen. Dan, we're ready to open it up for questions. Operator : Certainly. Our first question today comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good morning, gentlemen. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Ross. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : So, Marc, the company has had a remarkable ability to identify assets before inflections in their business. Obviously, it happened with Life Tech, and now we're seeing it with FEI. I count the core growth there was north of 20%, so that business is seemingly on fire. I guess as we think about that, and then eventually Patheon rolling into the organic over time, what would it take, from an end market perspective, or what mix or shift of businesses would have to happen for organic growth not to ultimately accelerate from here? And I guess, as you look at the end markets as they trended over the balance of the quarter, what if anything should we keep in mind as an offset to this? Because it seems like, versus where we were several years ago, the business is poised to now be at the upper end of the peer group from a core growth perspective. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Ross, thanks for the question. I guess, a few thoughts. One is, the FEI acquisition is performing very well. The integration is an intensive effort, and the team really has not been distracted, so they're doing a good job of integrating the business, but they're also delivering good growth and good bookings. And that's a testament to the strength of the team and the proven integration processes we have, so that's obviously a positive. As I look towards the end markets just broadly in terms of growth, at a high level, we finished the first half up 4%. Each quarter was 4%. We maintained our guidance at 4% for the year. Obviously, we're going to strive to drive to the best possible performance. If I'd say what are the catalysts from here in terms of stronger momentum as you think about 2018 and beyond, or even second half and beyond, it's going to be, let's get a U.S. government budget in place for 2018. It was good to get the 2017 budget. It was good to see NIH funding increased. We'll continue to educate Congress, but I feel good about that process. So if we can get \u2013 skip a continuing resolution, get a budget in place, that would clearly continue some momentum in academic. And then, at least from our own perspective, we don't really wait for the end markets; it's the actions we take. So we have a lot of effort around product development that put us in a position to be in the higher ends of our growth targets. So that's how I would think about it, Ross, at a high level. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : And maybe just on the pharma end market, you gave a few points that were helpful. As you think about the pacing there and what we've seen in different sub-segments of that market, I know I think coming into the year, you guys had talked about growth rates consistent with what we've seen, or maybe they've been slightly better. But how are you thinking about the exit velocity of that business out of the quarter, or that segment, and then some of the moving parts there, in terms of how that's likely to trend? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So, Ross, let me give you a relatively comprehensive view on pharma and biotech. I know it's an area of interest. First is, pharma and biotech is our strongest end market. We performed very well in the quarter. We grew a couple points higher than the company average serving that market. In terms of what drove that growth, first, as I mentioned last quarter, our clinical trials business was impacted by the discontinuation of a large Phase 3 study, and that headwind will sunset in Q4. Bioproduction growth was a bit more muted this quarter, and you've seen that across the industry. The super important point to highlight is that our business is serving the research customers. Biosciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry, and the channel, they all grew incredibly strongly in the quarter. So it was another great quarter for us, and our value proposition continues to resonate very well with the customer base. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : That's helpful, thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Ross. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. Marc, maybe I want to pick up on that last point on the Life Sciences Solutions. It was the slowest growth we've seen in a little while for that segment. Can you maybe just talk on your outlook there, and some of the comments you've previously made on bioprocess being a little bit softer? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Sure, Tycho, thanks for the question. So, when you look at Life Sciences Solutions, we had 7% growth in Q1, 3% growth in Q2, 5% average for the first half. I would focus on the 5% average. And when you look at \u2013 Easter played a little bit of an effect with a little bit of a benefit in Q1, obviously a little bit of a headwind in Q2. And when I look at the outlook for the business, it looks good. When you get into the details of why was growth a little bit slower, particularly in Q2, holding aside timing and those things, bioproduction was a little bit more in line with where the industry was growing in this particular quarter, and the biosciences business continues to do very well. So that's really the factors from Life Sciences Solutions. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then following up on the FEI question, how much of the inflection we're seeing now is on the Cryo-EM side versus the semi cycle picking up for that business? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So when you look at the performance of the Cryo-EM, that continues to go extremely well, with strong growth in revenue and strong growth in bookings. The material science business, which includes basically everything else, semiconductor and all the other applications for electron microscopy, clearly is continuing to be very strong. And you're seeing the benefit of a strong pipeline in semiconductor as well as good performance in material science applications elsewhere. So that business is performing at a very strong level. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, and then just last one on capital deployment. With the equity issuance component to the Patheon deal, it seems like the door is still open to attempt to do another acquisition in the near to intermediate term. Can you maybe just talk on your appetite and willingness to do another deal? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: From our perspective, our number one priority is to run the businesses that we have and run them very well. And we're excited about our portfolio, and we're looking forward to closing Patheon and successfully integrating that and creating value for our customers and our shareholders. We continue to have an active pipeline of smaller bolt-on transactions, and we'll continue to look at those transactions. And should the right ones make sense, you will continue to see us do a modest level of M&A from that perspective. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Tycho. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Derik. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. The Specialty Diagnostics businesses for the second quarter in a row has been a little bit below what we had calculated. And I think we're trying to fathom that, given that the patient visit data looks pretty decent from IMS and some of the other ones. Can you talk us through what's going on in the Specialty Diagnostics business? And is there something going on from a healthcare perspective? Are people worried about healthcare reform or something like that? Can you walk us through \u2013 are people not buying or worried about how many people are not buying instruments or things like that that is potentially slowing the market down? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Derik, it's a very good question, so let's delve into Specialty Diagnostics a little bit. It was low single-digit growth in the quarter, consistent with what we've seen over the last few quarters. The two businesses that had very strong growth were our biomarker business and our transplant diagnostic business, and every other business in that portfolio was stable and all grew modestly. So if you look at it from a product range perspective, two really strong growing businesses and then the rest of the portfolio stable and modest growth. When you look at geographically, really it was Europe that was not robust. North America is fine. And when you look at the activity, it seems that there are many bright spots in Europe, but it seems that healthcare was relatively modest from that perspective. So I wouldn't be reading too much into the ACA and PAMA and those things. That's not really been a big factor. We are taking a number of actions to strengthen the growth prospects of that business. Obviously, our Specialty Diagnostics business is incredibly profitable. It's been incredibly stable. It has great brand and customer allegiance, and it's all about taking low single-digit growth and making it faster. You probably saw that we introduced but did not launch yet our Cascadion mass spectrometer, and we will also introduce that at AACC [American Association of Clinical Chemistry]. That is intended for being launched sometime during the course of 2018, so it's not going to affect any revenue this year, but we want customers to get it into the budget cycle. So we're making progress but obviously, we were not planning to launch it this year anyway. But we're just working our way through that process, which should help growth over time as well. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, and then just one follow-up question. You called out in LPS that the channel business was quite strong. Considering that everyone is worried about Amazon in the world today, could you elaborate on how strong the channel business was and just give us a little bit more detail? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: The channel was very strong in the U.S. It was very strong in Europe. It was very strong in biotech and pharma, and it was very strong in industrial. There were no weak spots in the channel business. The team is doing a great job. And we take Amazon very seriously and we always have, and it's our job to manage through that. We're making big investments in our e-commerce capabilities, big investments in supply chain, the great personnel we have working in customer labs every day that really handles the hazardous goods or refrigerated materials. And the customer allegiance we have in the channel is fantastic. So that's how I would characterize it. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thank you very much. I'll get back in the queue. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. I just want to go back to Life Sciences Solutions for a minute. You talked a bit about bioprocessing growth coming back to the industry average. Is that just a function of the inherent lumpiness of that business, or is there something different going on fundamentally than maybe a quarter or two ago? And also within Life Sciences Solutions, I believe this is the first quarter where Affymetrix is fully in organic growth. I'm curious how integration is going there and if Affy was actually dilutive to Life Sciences Solutions organic growth in the quarter. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Doug, thanks for the question. So yes, bioproduction is definitely a lumpy business, and the long-term prospect for bioproduction is fantastic. When you think about the demand for biologics, biosimilars, vaccines in the pipeline, we are very bullish. One of the leading indicators we have is our biosciences business serves the research customer base with those technologies, especially media and sera, and that business is incredibly robust, so the activity level is very strong. So nothing is changing on the long-term outlook. There's some lumpiness. In Q2, while it grew reasonably, it was softer than the very torrid growth that we had the last few quarters, and we would expect that growth will pick up over time there. So that's our view on bioproduction. On the microarray business, really good news, we've always been transparent with everything, and we started out slower after the acquisition of that business. We had good growth in the microarray business. We had good growth in the e-biosciences business. Synergies have been very strong. And when you look at the full-year accretion in 2017, I am really excited that the team has put us right back on track for achieving the deal model goals for 2017 after starting off a little bit soft. This team has done a great job, so very good growth in microarrays in the quarter. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you for that. Pivoting to Europe, I think you guys grew low single digits in Europe. That's a bit lower than the growth rate we've seen from you over the past couple of quarters. Some of your peers have actually talked a bit about higher growth in Europe. Could you just talk about how Europe is going by end market and what's factored into guidance in terms of your expectations for the rest of the year? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: I think Europe \u2013 when I look at performance in Europe, Easter is obviously going to be the big swing factor. I just did a review with the team, our European leadership yesterday, and they feel good. So Q1 was strong. Q2 was more modest growth, and then that's really the shift of where the holiday was. And when they look at their outlook for the balance of the year, it's right in line with growth that should be for the full year just below the company average. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Which is what we had guided to originally. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So I don't see Europe as a major story. If you go down to the end markets, I would say that the diagnostic business across is a little bit softer than we originally would have expected, and the rest of the segments are a little bit stronger would be the take. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, one last one, I just want to make sure. I think this is the case, but I just want to make sure that you still are assuming mid-single-digit to high single-digit biopharmaceutical end market growth in your full-year guidance. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes, so the last few years, we've started out our guidance for biopharma end market being mid-single to high single-digit growth, and that continues to be our outlook for this year, so no change. And when you look at the first half, we're right in the middle of that range at this point. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, that's great, thank you again. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to dig a little bit more into the analytical instrument performance, another good organic there. Can you talk about the trends throughout the quarter? Good to hear about chemical analysis, but just how things trended and the outlook there for the rest of the year. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, the Analytical Instruments business, it's a really positive story. And if you think about for a lot of quarters, like many, we've talked about how strong the chrome and mass spec business was and that it was offsetting weakness in chemical analysis. The chrome mass spec business was very strong in the quarter, and it was particularly strong serving the biotech and pharmaceutical customers. So that business is really humming. And chemical analysis returned to growth, which is great. And we saw both our long-cycle and short-cycle revenue to the industrial customer base pick up, and bookings continue to be positive, so that's good. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: And, Jack, this is Stephen. Just to add on the chemical analysis side, we've been seeing that trend for a while in terms of the bookings coming. And it's good to see that both the short-cycle and long-cycle aspect of that business picking up and delivered positive organic growth in Q2. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: And then obviously in the fourth quarter, the last week of September and the fourth quarter, the electron microscopy business will become part of the organic growth calculation for those businesses as well. So the Analytical Instruments team is doing a really good job, and the results demonstrate that. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, that's helpful, and then one for Stephen. I think it's a similar question I asked last quarter. Just the margins in LPS, could you elaborate a little bit more there? Is it just the biopharma services contract you talked about, or are there any other mix changes in the channel? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: It's really the drivers are the clinical trials business, the biopharma services, the same drivers as last quarter in terms of the pressure there, and that will sunset by Q4. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Outside of that, would margins have been up in the quarter in that segment? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes, marginally yes. It's not as if we'll see significant margin expansion over time. But yes, that's correct. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Evans with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Marc, on the large clinical trial cancellation, if that had not occurred, would you be calling out, say, something more like mid to high single-digit growth this quarter in the pharma end market? Is it big enough to skew things that much? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes, it would have been high single-digit growth, right around that range, yes. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Would it have been high single-digit growth without that cancellation? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then just on the EPS bridge, I want to make sure that we have that on the guidance. So it's going up $0.065 at the midpoint. It sounds like that's absorbing $0.05 of interest, and then you've got $0.02 FX. So basically we're talking \u2013 is that right? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Let me just clarify. The $0.065 includes the FX piece, so it's operational performance in Q2 plus the change in FX for the year, and my guidance is $0.02. That gets you the $0.065 increase, and that's offset by $0.05 dilution from the interest cost on the European bond offering. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Other than that, the midpoint is $0.015. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's great. Thank you, okay. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Tim. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Tim. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Stephen Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Steve. Stephen Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Just I was wondering if you could comment a bit more on what you're seeing in the academic end market. I believe, and I might have missed some of it, you commented that it was a little bit weaker this quarter. I'm just trying to see what you saw both, I guess, from academic and government, both in the U.S. and in Europe, and what your expectations are over the rest of the year? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Actually, academic and government, while still low single digit, wasn't weaker. It actually was slightly better than Q1. And, when you look at it, actually North America was a bit better. So I think the fact that you got a 2017 budget, it showed the increase in NIH, that's starting to flow into the results. Geographically, China was good as well, and Europe was a little bit softer, and it's probably mostly timing between Q1 and Q2. Stephen Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay, and then just one follow-up question for Stephen. Within the guidance bridge that you were talking about there, the operational performance, can you describe or quantify how much of that is stronger growth from FEI versus the underlying base business? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: It's approximately $0.03 more from FEI and $0.015 from the base business. Stephen Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great, thank you. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Thanks. Marc or Stephen, to your points on chemical analysis, does that feel like that business should stay positive in the back half of the year, just given the way bookings are shaping up? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: We don't forecast by each of our businesses, especially at that level. But clearly, the trends are positive and I think that's a reasonable assumption you're making. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And maybe just on China, curious if you're willing to parse out the growth that you're seeing, or you're expecting this year. If we just look at life sciences, the life sciences piece versus the applied industrial business. Just be helpful to understand the relative contributions there on the two sides of the equation. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So we had mid-teens growth in China. We had strong bookings. The outlook is good for the full year, that's been trends continued. Clearly, our customers value our scale and the experience that we create because of that scale. In terms of more color, I would say generally, the business across pharma and biotech, life science research, those typically is pretty strong. Industrial is recovering and growing. Applied is very strong there, as is healthcare and diagnostics. So it's fairly broad-based, right, in terms of what the growth is in China. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And just finishing, on your comment on the outlook, is a double-digit growth rate for the year assumed in guidance for China? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes, our guidance assumes basically double-digit growth for China. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: As you know, it's our fastest growing market. It has been and it's a market we think the outlook is very strong. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: I think the bookings profile is very positive. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you, okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks, it's actually Joel in for Isaac. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Hi, Joel. Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Just touching back on the FEI question, maybe just focusing in on the Cryo-EM opportunity, could you maybe comment on whether, just given the underlying academic funding environment, if there's been wallet share dynamics with other technologies in the lab, that you've been gaining some share from, that contributed to the growth in the first half of the year? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: I think that, from my interactions with customers around Cryo-EM, and there's been a number \u2013 wow, what an amazing technology. The enthusiasm across the customer base is huge, and it's making them rethink other large investment areas that might have traditionally gotten that funding. So, I have not heard funding. In all of the discussions, funding has not come up as an issue, meaning that this is profound enough that customers will go out and get the money. And in those areas where there's lots and lots of funding, that's one way. And if there are other areas where funding is more muted, they're probably taking it from other technologies, and likely from technologies that we don't provide, so we're not cannibalizing ourselves. Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, thanks, and then just maybe one on the P&L. Looks like there's been a little bit of an uptick in R&D expense in the first half of the year. Just how should we be thinking about that line item throughout the remainder of 2017? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So in terms of the R&D, the driver of the change as a percentage really is the inclusion of FEI. It has a higher than average across the company spend in R&D. We're continuing to invest in that business, so that dynamic will play out in Q3, and then it will be in the comps in Q4 overall. Actually, among Q3 for FEI, just as a reminder, that we have the stub period, which was a very profitable stub period in Q3 last year, and that will be it in our comps in terms of margin expansion as you look at the second half of the year for the company as a whole, so it has a little bit of a drag on Q3 margins. Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Joel. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Please go ahead. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hi, Marc. Could you talk about FEI? Was the growth there a component of the semiconductor cycle, just the level of \u2013 the breakout of that growth would be helpful? Thanks. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Sure. So, Paul, when you look at the FEI business, the growth was very, very robust in the life science applications, in the semiconductor applications, and we had good growth in the remaining material science applications. So the business would have delivered strong growth even if semiconductor was more muted, but semiconductor was very strong and bookings were very strong. So that's very positive in terms of how the business is performing. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : And then regarding China, do you think \u2013 do you see budget cycles or with a five-year plan now in place, is it a consistent rollout this year? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: It's been very good now for quite a number of quarters. Since the beginning of 2015, we've had very strong growth every quarter in China, and the outlook continues to be quite good. We're very aligned with the five-year plan. As you know, China has a big focus on environmental protection, a big focus on food safety, and certainly around expanding the healthcare market, as well their healthcare capabilities. So we're seeing broad-based growth, and we would expect China to continue to be our fastest growing end market. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, good morning, just a couple housekeeping questions we're seeing. On Patheon, number one, would you care to update us on what you view as the anticipated accretion in year one now that the debt financing is in place? Number two, what are the next steps or exact approval milestones needed before closing? And thirdly, can you just explain the rationale of keeping the interest expense in the core EPS number rather than backing it out before the close? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So I'll do part of it and Stephen will do part of it. I'll do the path to close, and Stephen will do the two financial questions. In terms of the path to close, we obviously got our U.S. clearance quickly. The European Union accepted the filing, which means that they start the regulatory process, which will go on during the course of the summer. And then the last of the regulatory filings, which has a more variable range on when it will wrap up, is Brazil, which we're working through. And then we need to have the shareholder vote and the tender process, which we're working through as well. So we feel very confident that the transaction will close before the end of the year or by the end of the year, and we're just working to work that through as expeditiously as possible. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: And in terms of the financing, obviously we're working to ensure that we've got the permanent financing in place for the timing of the deal close, whenever that may happen. You saw the first part of that being executed last week, which was the European bond offering that we did, so that was $3 billion of a debt raise, so that's just the first element. We've got additional debt to raise and we've got an equity element as well. And we continue to work the rest of those elements, and those details will be public as we execute those. In terms of the guidance, so we actually completed the European bond offering, so it's a known event. So I included it in the guidance for the full year. So that's a consistent approach in the way that we have approached pending acquisitions in the past. So we're treating Patheon and its related financing in that consistent way. So as things will crystallize, I put them into the guidance. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Pretty good, thank you. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Brandon. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Dan, we have time for just one more. Operator : And our final question will come from the line of Catherine Schulte with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, thanks for the questions. You mentioned getting a U.S. budget in place would be a positive. What kind of size of NIH funding increase would you need to see to consider it a good enough outcome? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: I was with members of Congress fairly recently. I think the strong support for continued funding of NIH and continued growth in funding, and we'll continue to educate the importance of that. Things like the 21st Century Cures is obviously a positive. To us, what we're focused on is to avoid the continuing resolution, which obviously creates some level of uncertainty and freezes budgets. The House is talking I think a $1 billion increase, and I think the Senate might be talking a little bit more. The exact number to me is less of a focus than an increase in funding and getting a budget done. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. I have... Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thank you, Catherine. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Talk about your organic growth assumptions by division for the back half of the year? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Really, I think in terms of the of the full-year outlook, it hasn't changed in terms of our initial guide. So I think Life Sciences Solutions and Analytical Instruments would be the faster-growing businesses out of the four. So that's really the way to think about the speed of growth for the respective businesses for the full year. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Catherine. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So let me just wrap it up briefly. As we reflect on where we are, we're very pleased to have achieved a strong first half, and we're very well-positioned to deliver another great year. And of course, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. We look forward to updating you on the Q3 call. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thanks to everyone for attending. This will conclude today's conference call, and you may now disconnect.",

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our Q3 call. I am pleased to report that Q3 was another excellent quarter for Thermo Fisher Scientific. We achieved strong growth on both the top and bottom line thanks to sharp execution by our team. We had a number of developments in the quarter that strengthened our leadership and innovation and in emerging markets. And we significantly enhanced our customer value proposition by adding new capabilities through the acquisition of Patheon, which we were able to complete earlier than expected. With an excellent nine months behind us, we're well positioned to achieve our growth goals for the year. So let me start with a quick overview of our Q3 financial highlights. First, we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving a 14% increase to $2.31 per share. Our revenue in Q3 also grew 14% year over year. Our adjusted operating income increased 13%. Before I turn to our end markets, I wanted to acknowledge the tremendous effort of our teams. The natural disasters during the past couple of months have been unprecedented, and our teams have managed through very effectively. I've been inspired by how our colleagues across the company have stepped in to offer their support in many different ways from both a humanitarian and an operational perspective. For us, the most significant impact was in Puerto Rico. About 700 colleagues and their families are located on the island, and we were relieved to learn that they were all safe. Even with tough challenges at home, it was humbling to see colleagues return to work focused on doing everything they could to meet customer requirements. It reinforced our culture of intensity and involvement, which is the foundation for how we work every day, but really stands out in times like these. Our legacy Patheon site in Manati, Puerto Rico is the only one still experiencing disruption, but we're making steady progress in getting the facility back to full operation. Now let me provide you some color on our Q3 performance relative to our key end markets. Starting with pharma and biotech, we grew in the mid-single digits in Q3. Our chromatography and mass spectrometry and biosciences businesses performed well. We also had strong growth in our research and safety market channel. Our value proposition for these customers remain a key competitive advantage for us, and we continue to build on our leading position. Diagnostics and healthcare grew in the low single digits, in line with what we've been seeing all year, with good growth in our transplant and immunodiagnostic businesses. In academic and government, we were pleased to report mid-single-digit growth, driven by strong performance in Europe and China. Last, in industrial and applied, we continued to benefit from increasing global demand and grew here in the mid-single digits. We saw particular strength across our analytical instrument businesses in Asia-Pacific. We also continue to make excellent progress in setting Thermo Fisher up for an even stronger future. As you know, the three elements of our growth strategy are : developing high-impact innovative new products; leveraging our scale in Asia-Pacific and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. I emphasize these each quarter because it illustrates our commitment to a consistent and well-defined strategy that continues to strengthen our competitive position. So with that, I'll get into our Q3 highlights, starting with innovation. First, we launched four new Thermo Scientific products at the Microscopy & Microanalysis meeting in early August to strengthen our leadership in electron microscopy. For material science applications, we launched two new scanning electron microscopes, the Quattro and the Talos F200i, to help scientists advance nanomaterials research. And for life sciences applications, we launched the Krios G3i and Glacios Cryo-EM systems to make the analysis of proteins and other biomolecular structures faster and easier. Our goal is to bring Cryo-EM to a broader range of scientists and raise the standards of performance and workflow automation. We were also very pleased to learn in early October that the three scientists who won the Nobel Prize in chemistry work with our Cryo-EM systems. As a result of their efforts, scientists can now routinely produce high-resolution 3D images of protein structures. These developments can lead to a better understanding of biological function and ultimately to new therapies. As you know, we gained these groundbreaking capabilities through our acquisition of FEI, which is part of our analytical instruments offering. We surpassed the one-year anniversary of this transaction in late September, and the teams are doing a great job with the integration. The business continues to perform extremely well, and we're on track to achieve our synergy targets. Another notable launch in our Analytical Instruments business was our new line of Thermo Scientific air-quality monitors, called the iQ Series. These new instruments are designed to help global customers in the power industry and government agencies more easily gather and manage critical air quality data. The iQ Series platform includes mobile applications for remote monitoring and control as well as wireless connectivity and enhanced services. I also want to quickly mention that our new mass spectrometry systems launched at ASMS [American Society for Mass Spectrometry] in June, including the Q Exactive HF-X and our new Altis and Quantis triple-quads, have been exceptionally well received. Our innovative mass spec platforms are really resonating with customers working in both research and applied markets. Last, I'll touch on a significant development in our Life Science Solutions business. Our Dynabead technology was integral to the first FDA-approved gene therapy, which will be used to treat a specific form of leukemia in children and young adults. These magnetic beads are able to isolate, activate, and amplify T-cells that have been genetically programmed to identify and fight cancer cells in individual patients. This groundbreaking innovation in gene therapy was a result of our longstanding collaboration with Novartis. It's another great example of our commitment to advance precision medicine by partnering with leaders in industry, government, and academia. Turning to our second key growth driver, Asia-Pacific and emerging markets, we continued our strong performance in the region in Q3. China again led the way with growth in the high teens, and we also had strong results in South Korea and India. In China, we continued to build on our leading presence with the opening of our Precision Medicine Customer Experience Center in Guangzhou in the quarter. The facility is an impressive showcase for our wide range of workflow solutions to advance research in genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. And it also serves as a hub for customer training, collaboration, and application development. This milestone is a continuation of our strategic collaboration with the Guangzhou government. Earlier this year, we kicked off another collaboration with the Mab-Venture Pharmaceutical to jointly establish a new center to accelerate the development of biopharmaceuticals. Guangzhou is at the heart of healthcare innovation in China, and these are good examples of our in-China for-China strategy to introduce new capabilities geared specifically to local customers. Our third growth driver is our customer value proposition, and we continued to invest significantly to enhance our offering and strengthen our competitive position. As you know, in late August we closed our acquisition of Patheon, which was ahead of the timeline we communicated when we announced the transaction back in May. We welcomed 9,000 new colleagues to our team, and it was great to be at the Greenville, North Carolina site to participate in the day-one event. I've been at a number of the facilities. The operations are impressive, and the teams are energized to take the great business they've built to the next level as part of Thermo Fisher. We're only two months into the integration, but we're already more excited about the opportunities we have to become an even stronger partner for our pharma and biotech customers. As we communicated previously, we expect to realize total synergies of approximately $120 million by year three following the close. This would consist of approximately $90 million of cost synergies and about $30 million of adjusted operating income benefit from revenue-related synergies. It's early in the integration but we're off to a great start, and we look forward to updating you on our progress over time. So it was another active year for capital deployment. As you know, in addition to buying back our stock, we continued to strengthen our strategic position by completing a number of acquisitions, with Patheon being the largest this year. In terms of our short-term capital deployment priorities, they're twofold. First, with the close of the Patheon acquisition, we're already paying down debt. And second, the manner in which we financed the Patheon acquisition also gives us the capacity to continue to capitalize on M&A opportunities. Our pipeline is active, and we continue to evaluate new opportunities to create shareholder value. Let me now turn to our guidance for 2017. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the full year. This reflects the addition of Patheon, the strength of our operational performance, and our ongoing commitment to delivering the benefits of a more favorable FX environment. Stephen will cover the details, but at a high level, we're raising our revenue guidance to a new range of $20.50 billion to $20.66 billion, which would now result in 12% to 13% growth over 2016. In terms of our adjusted EPS, we're raising our guidance to a new range of $9.29 to $9.38 for 2017, which also represents 12% to 13% growth year over year. Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize our key takeaways from Q3. We delivered another excellent quarter financially and operationally. We completed our acquisition of Patheon, and the integration is off to a strong start. We made terrific progress in the past nine months, and we're on track to deliver another excellent year. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our third quarter results for the total company, and then I'll provide some color on our four business segments and wrap up with an updated 2017 guidance. Before I get into the details, let me remind you that our results now reflect the addition of the Patheon acquisition, which we closed on August 29. Patheon's results are now part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment. So with that, let me start with a high-level view of how the third quarter performed versus our expectations at the time of the last earnings call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered a very strong quarter with 5% organic growth in Q3, which was above the midpoint of our previous guidance range and was driven by strong operational execution. We were also able to deliver $0.11 more adjusted earnings per share in Q3 than we had assumed in the midpoint of our previous guidance. This was driven by four factors of roughly equal magnitude : the pull-through on the incremental organic growth; a more favorable foreign exchange environment; the timing of our discrete tax planning actions; and the contributions from Patheon. Now let me give you more color on the quarter, starting with our total company financial performance. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS in Q3 by 14% to $2.31. GAAP EPS was $1.34, up 13% from Q3 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 14% year over year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue included 5% organic growth, 8% growth from acquisitions, and a 1% tailwind from foreign exchange. Looking at our growth by geography in Q3, Europe grew in the mid-single digits. North America grew in the low single digits. Asia-Pacific grew in the low double digits, including high teens growth in China. And finally, rest of the world grew in the mid-single digits. Turning to our operational performance, Q3 adjusted operating income increased 13% and adjusted operating margin was 22.9%, which contracted 10 basis points from Q3 of last year. Patheon was 40 basis points dilutive to margins in the quarter and FX a further 10 basis points dilution. As a reminder, Patheon is a scale acquisition, with gross margins and adjusted operating income margins lower than the company average. So as we incorporate the results of Patheon into our financials over the first 12 months, it will have a dilutive impact to year-over-year margin expansion. The rest of the business saw good margin expansion, driven by our PPI Business System and volume leverage, partially offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. Adjusted gross margin came in at 48.4% in Q3. This represents a contraction of 50 basis points from the prior year. The combination of Patheon and FX lowered gross margins by 100 basis points in the quarter. The rest of the business saw good gross margin expansion, driven by very strong contributions from our PPI Business System, partially offset by business mix. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 21.2% of revenue, which is 60 basis points favorable to Q3 2016. And R&D expense came in at 4.3% of revenue. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 6.6%, up 50 basis points over Q3 2016. Looking at our results below the line. Net interest expense was $132 million, up $29 million from Q3 2016, mainly as a result of our incremental debt related to the capital deployment actions this year. Adjusted other income and expense was net income of $7 million within the quarter, which is $6 million favorable versus Q3 2016, driven primarily by non-operating FX gains. Our adjusted tax rate in Q3 was 11.8%, which is 130 basis points lower than last year, due to our tax planning activities and the impact of Patheon. The timing of discrete tax planning actions within Q3 and Q4 of 2017 is different versus our previous guidance. As a result, the Q3 tax rate is slightly lower than previously expected and the Q4 tax rate will be slightly higher, with no net impact expected on the year due to the shift in timing. And average diluted shares were 399.6 million, up 2.2 million year over year, due to the completion of the recent equity offering and option dilution, partially offset by previous share buybacks. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations for the first nine months of the year was $2.15 billion, and free cash flow was $1.85 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $290 million. Free cash flow is $85 million higher than the same period of last year and includes approximately $200 million of one-time cash payments related to the Patheon acquisition. We ended the quarter with $745 million in cash and investments. And similar to previous quarters, we paid $60 million of dividends in Q3. Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $22 billion, up $5.2 billion sequentially from Q2, as a result of the financing related to the Patheon acquisition. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 4.4 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA on a reported basis and 4.1 times on a pro forma basis, which is in line with our expectations. And wrapping up my comments on our total company performance, our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC was 9.8%, flat versus prior year. This represents approximately 100 basis points of operational improvement over Q3 2016, in line with our expectations. Now let me give you some color on the revenue and operational performance of our four business segments. Starting with the Life Sciences Solutions segment, reported revenue grew 5% and organic revenue increased 4% in Q3. Our Biosciences business delivered another strong quarter of growth. Q3 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 17%, and adjusted operating margin grew 320 basis points year over year to 32.8%. In the quarter, we saw very strong productivity, volume pull-through, and positive business mix, partially offset by strategic investments. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 32% in Q3 and organic revenue growth was 11%. This segment includes our FEI electron microscopy product line, which is part of our materials science business. In the quarter, we had strong growth in our chromatography and mass spec and our materials science businesses. We also continued to see growth in our chemical analysis business. Q3 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments grew 35% and adjusted operating margin was 21.6%, up 40 basis points year over year. In the quarter, adjusted operating margin benefited from our PPI Business System, volume pull-through, and acquisitions, partially offset by strategic investments and foreign exchange. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment, in Q3 revenue grew 6% and organic revenue growth was 4%. We saw good organic growth contributions from all of our businesses in the segment in Q3, with particularly strong growth in our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income increased 2% in Q3 and adjusted operating margin was 25.9%, which represents a contraction of 90 basis points from Q3 of the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was positively affected by volume and productivity. However, this was more than offset by strategic investments and business mix. Finally in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, which now includes the Patheon acquisition, Q3 reported revenue increased 15%, and organic revenue growth was 3%. Our channel business once again delivered strong growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating income in this segment increased 1%, and adjusted operating margin was 12.6%, down 170 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin benefited from strong productivity and volume leverage. However, as expected, this was more than offset by the impact of unfavorable business mix, driven by our clinical trials business and by strategic investments. As a reminder, the clinical trials business was affected by the discontinuation of a large Phase 3 clinical trial in late 2016, and the impact will sunset by the end of Q4. With that, I'll now move on to our full-year 2017 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we are raising the revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance. Let me walk you through the details, starting with revenue. The midpoint of our revenue guidance is increasing $780 million to reflect $670 million from Patheon, an $80 million improvement in foreign exchange, and a $25 million increase in organic revenue as a result of our operating performance in Q3. The full-year organic growth outlook is therefore $25 million higher than our previous guidance, but it did not change the ramp for the full year, so we still expect 4% organic growth for 2017. On adjusted earnings per share, we're increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.12. This includes $0.05 impact from Patheon, $0.04 improved operational performance, and $0.03 from a less adverse FX environment. And finally, with three quarters of strong operational performance behind us, we're narrowing our revenue guidance range to $160 million and narrowing our adjusted earnings per share range to $0.09. As Mark mentioned, Hurricane Maria caused widespread damage to Puerto Rico last month, and our thoughts and prayers are with the people affected. We have three operational sites on the island. The largest, the legacy Patheon site, is still offline. We're working with our customers to get that site back online as soon as possible. We currently estimate the impact of the site being offline to be approximately $0.05 of adjusted earnings per share, and that is factored into the guidance I just outlined. So despite this headwind, we're still able to increase guidance at the midpoint by $0.12, which indicates that we're executing very well. To sum up the guidance changes, the increased 2017 revenue guidance is now a range of $20.5 billion to $20.66 billion, which would represent 12% to 13% growth versus 2016. We expect acquisitions to contribute just under 9% to our reported revenue growth in 2017, and FX is expected to be a year-over-year headwind of $10 million, a negligible impact on growth. In terms of adjusted earnings per share, our increased 2017 guidance is now a range of $9.29 to $9.38, with a midpoint of $9.335. This represents growth of 12% to 13% versus 2016. We now expect a headwind from foreign exchange of $0.12 for the year. Excluding the impact of FX, this would represent adjusted earnings per share growth of 14% to 15%. A few other details behind the revised 2017 guidance; as I mentioned earlier, Patheon's margin profile is lower than the average for the company, so it will be dilutive to the overall operating margins for the first 12 months. Our revised guidance now assumes that we will deliver 20 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion in 2017. Excluding Patheon, the revised guidance is 60 basis points expansion, which is slightly higher than our previous guidance. Net interest expense has increased $30 million from our previous guidance to $510 million as a result of the financing of the Patheon acquisition. And we're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be 13% for the year, which is a 30 basis points reduction from our previous guidance due to the positive impact of the Patheon acquisition. We've completed $750 million of share buybacks this year, all in the first half. And at this point, we do not expect any additional buybacks in 2017. We continue to assume we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends in 2017. Our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures, and full-year average diluted shares are now estimated to be 398 million, which is a 4 million increase from the previous guidance due to the completion of a recent equity offering. Q4 average diluted shares are estimated to be 404.5 million. We're assuming net capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million, no change from the previous guidance. And with respect to free cash flow, as I mentioned earlier, we've incurred approximately $200 million of one-time cash payments related to the Patheon acquisition. This is being offset by improved operational cash flow, including a small benefit from the Patheon business. So we continue to expect to generate about $3.15 billion of free cash flow for 2017. As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view of how we see results playing out. So in summary, we delivered three strong quarters of operational performance, flowed through the benefit of a more favorable FX environment, and executed really well on our capital deployment strategy. All of this keeps us well on track to deliver an excellent 2017. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to open it up for Q&A. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin, Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Derik. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So a couple of questions. So the 11% organic number in Analytical Instruments, what was the FEI contribution to that? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So, Derik, in terms of Analytical Instruments, we had very strong performance from our chromatography and mass spectrometry business. It's good to see chemical analysis also return to growth. FEI had strong double-digit growth in the quarter. Obviously, it was a partial quarter impact just given the anniversary, but obviously, electron microscopy also contributed to the strong growth. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And so staying on the Analytical Instruments side, and this is a question for both your industrial and your pharma customers, as we talk about increasing interest in tax reform in the U.S. and there's talking about immediate expensing of capital, are you seeing any potential hesitation in terms of people looking to spend in Q4? The question on the budget flushing, thinking about if people think tax reform is coming, would they push instrumentation spending off into next year? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: If I think about what's happened in industrial and applied end markets, we saw real strength in Asia-Pacific. The U.S. has been pretty consistent. Customers really haven't talked much about sitting on the sidelines because of potential tax regulations. So I think the U.S. has not been strong with industrial. It's been slowly recovering. So I don't think we're expecting a big factor one way or the other from U.S. tax policy on demand. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, and I'll get back in the queue. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thank you, Derik. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Derik. Operator : Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks, great quarter. Marc, I want to maybe follow up on that questioning on FEI. I'm curious how much of the growth is coming on the semi side versus Cryo-EM uptake. And then with the new systems, is this reflecting some strong early interest on the pharma side? It seems like the new platforms are geared toward drug development. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So, Tycho, thanks for the question. When I think about how the FEI business has performed, given that it's just past the one-year anniversary, it's a good time to reflect on what's happened. I think at the highest level, the business has benefited tremendously from our integration approach, right? Our PPI Business System has helped them expand capacity. And our business management system, part of PPI, ruthless prioritization on the most important things has allowed both the materials sciences businesses and the life sciences businesses to really significantly accelerate growth over anything the business has delivered over the last number of years, and the team has done a fabulous job of executing. When I think about the two end markets, materials sciences is in a strong part of the cycle. That's both industrial and semiconductor customers. Semiconductor has been very strong, but we've also seen a nice acceleration in our life sciences customers as well as strong bookings growth as well. So the businesses are performing well across all fronts. The new products are geared towards both the nano material research on the materials science side. And on the life sciences side, we are getting some level of interest from biotech and pharma customers, although it's still a bit early, but the feedback has been positive. When you summarize the whole story on FEI, I think the way I would characterize it, performance has been so strong that relative to the underwriting case that we talked about when we announced the deal on the call a little over a year ago, we're going to meet our ROIC hurdle a full year earlier than what we articulated back then. So it's been a great acquisition, off to a great start, and we're going to fully capitalize on the opportunities ahead. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. And then a follow-up, I'm just curious on your comments on bioprocess. There's a fair amount of noise in that market now with biosimilars and some of the drug companies working down inventory at both the supplier and the manufacturer. You see both sides of it. I was just curious \u2013 your comments on the outlook for that market, I know it slowed a little bit last quarter. That was more timing on the supplier side, but I was curious how you see the outlook there. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So, Tycho, in terms of bioproduction, we had moderate growth, very similar to what we saw in Q2. We continue to see very strong early indicators that really showed up in the biosciences business for cell culture media and sera as well as in the smaller biotech demand for our clinical trials activity. So the early indicators, leading indicators are very strong, and conditions were similar to what we saw in Q2 with moderate growth. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Tycho. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning and thanks for the time here, everyone. First question is actually on the fourth quarter, the implied fourth quarter expectations. It would be really helpful if you could try to frame up for us, quantify for us what you think the bottom line impact in the fourth quarter would be from Patheon specifically and from any lingering impacts from the situation in Puerto Rico or the natural disasters, more specifically top/bottom line. Whatever you have on hand would be very, very helpful. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So I'll do a little bit of it and then Stephen will give maybe a more comprehensive view. In terms of the fourth quarter, other than bringing our Manati, Puerto Rico site back online, we're not expecting really any impact from weather. So what you would see from that in the fourth quarter is embedded in our guidance of about a $0.05 headwind, probably a little bit we got at the end of the third quarter, but a $0.05 headwind in Manati based on just getting the operation back online. And, Stephen, you might want to discuss some puts and takes. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes, so just some additional color. So the $675 million of revenue for Patheon that we've added to guidance, $190 million of that was recognized in Q3. And then in terms of Q4 for the net accretion, including the impact of the Puerto Rico issue for that site, it's still $0.02 additional accretion in that $0.12 change that I gave you at the midpoint. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, got it. I really appreciate that. And then, Marc, it's always really helpful to hear how you're thinking about a couple of things going forward. I think one is it's very helpful to hear how you think what the critical factors outside the company's control are with regard to where the trajectory of the business is within the 4-to-6 framework. And then maybe a subcategory of that framework is always the NIH, not necessarily budgets but more disbursements, and then I'll get back in queue. Thanks so much. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks for the question. So the company is performing extremely well. When I think about the quarter, 5% organic growth. When I think about the end markets, we saw improved performance and really strong execution, both academic and government and industrial, applied, very, very positive. When I think about the outlook for Q4, basically we've raised our outlook for organic growth based on the Q3 performance. We've maintained for the fourth quarter the same level of organic growth that we assumed back in July. And the reason we did that is there's always a range of outcomes on what year-end spend is, and we're obviously going to drive to the highest possible number. So I think in the fourth quarter, the things we look at is where does FX rates finally settling at, and ultimately what's the level of year-end spend. And as you look back over many years past, we'll do a good job of capitalizing on all the market opportunities out there and creating some new ones as well. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks so much. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: You're welcome. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Your line is open. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Doug. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: You increased full-year organic growth revenue expectations by $25 million. This is about the magnitude of the Q3 beat. It seems like you have stronger than expected FEI momentum. AI grew I think around 6% the last six months with no signs of slowing momentum. And Specialty Diagnostics growth is actually improving to levels that we haven't seen in a little while, just to name a few observations. Your guidance doesn't seem to reflect a continuation of improving momentum. Could you just speak to why that might be? And then I guess relatedly, is some of this weather, and would you be willing to quantify specifically what you believe the impact of weather was in the third quarter? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So, Doug, in terms of the fourth quarter, a couple points, the first of which is we were very comfortable banking everything we delivered versus our expectations organically in Q3 and then subsequently raising the guidance. We chose to keep the Q4 number the same as it is because, as you know, it's the one with the widest level of variation based on year-end spend, and we've assumed year-end spend to be exactly the same level as last year. So we believe that the range of outcomes has the possibility for better performance. So I think that's one way to think about it. I think the other way is, just when you go through the numbers, we have a more challenging comparison in our electron microscopy business in the fourth quarter. So it will be above the company average and we're very confident of that, but the contribution might be a little bit smaller in Q4 than what we saw in Q3. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: And the... Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Are you talking about weather? Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: The weather impact. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Weather here just in terms of customer demand in Q3 was probably about 0.5 point of impact. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And the expectation is some of that lingers into Q4. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Not a material amount. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, and just one more follow-up. I know Tycho asked the earlier question on bioproduction. I apologize if I missed it in his answer, but when do you expect that to pick up a little bit more with the bioproduction revenue trend? And specifically on destocking, which is what we've heard from a few of your peers, have you seen any impact from destocking in that part of your business? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Probably from our company perspective, it's better to give the pharma and biotech as an end market. And when I look at that, obviously, solid mid-single-digit growth in the quarter, real strength in the research applications. Bioproduction had moderate growth. It was a little bit slower, but still a good contributor. We saw some of our customers managing their inventory. Really with the advent of biosimilars becoming more important, I think customers are just managing inventory in a more prudent fashion. But the pipeline of new molecules is quite promising, and it will take some time to ramp up. So we're very, very bullish on the long-term prospects of bioproduction. We're very bullish on our competitive position across pharma and biotech, and it continues to be a great end market for us. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you for all that. Have a good day. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Doug. Operator : Your next question is from Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is open. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks, maybe just two on FEI. Stephen, on the top line, I'm just curious how much of the organic growth that you're seeing is actually falling through versus being reinvested. And then along those lines, we're coming into year-one accretion that's more like $0.40 than $0.30. And so is that right? I'm just wondering maybe if you have a view on year-two accretion or synergies given where the performance is. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Sorry, can you just clarify the first question? I didn't get it, sorry. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I'm just trying to understand how much within that business you're actually letting through to the bottom line. And then on accretion, for the year-one target that you had of $0.30, we're looking at more like $0.40. I'm just looking to see if that was right. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes, so we're appropriately investing in that business for the long term. And you see that, the results of that in the new products that have being introduced this quarter. But we're also printing very good EPS from the high growth that we're seeing this year. As you look at the first 12 months of this acquisition, as you said, we outlined $0.30 back at the beginning of the deal, and I think the actual number was $0.43, so very strong contribution from the acquisitions. And a significant amount of that was basically the base business revenue being higher. The synergies are running a little bit ahead. Probably $0.01 \u2013 about $0.02 of that beat was synergy-related. The rest was really from the base revenue. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then Marc had highlighted the new products that you've launched there recently. So I guess as we think about the gross margins for the AI business, I'm just curious whether you think that segment can benefit from an improving profile there. Prior to the deal, those guys had emphasized better gross margins on the newer instruments that were being launched. So I'm just curious if you think that's something that's meaningful at all going forward. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes, I think you'll continue to see gross margins expand, and certainly in the electron microscopy business just given the mix over time. The life sciences business a number of years ago was a lower-margin business for legacy FEI. And through our PPI Business System as well as our commitment to innovation, those products are increasing their margins. The materials science applications are, of course, still higher margins. They're a more fully established set of products. So mix matters within the business, but in the underlying pieces, margins are expanding in both. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: And just one other factor, the life sciences side of the businesses, the service stream for that is really ramping up. And that's slightly \u2013 that delays from the ramp-up in the instrument placements. So that will also help gross margins as we go out the next couple of years. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Super. Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is open. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Jack. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I have two biopharma questions. So I wanted to start with Patheon. So now that you've owned the acquisition for about two months, just talk about conviction in the revenue synergy's long-term trajectory there. And near term, if I think about the implied fourth quarter from Stephen's guidance, I think it's down a little bit year over year, maybe just how you think that turns going into 2018. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: In terms of the fourth quarter guidance, we're actually quite bullish on what the outlook is for the business. The end markets actually look good. So it is obviously \u2013 roughly around the 4% range would be what's implied based on the July guidance. And as we've talked, there's obviously a range of outcomes, with a good year-end finish could drive that higher. So that's the way to think about it. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: But one additional factor is, Jack, is that we have deferred revenue accounting adjustments at the beginning of the transaction, and it's fairly sizable for this deal. It's about $20 million of impact on revenue and profitability in Q4 for the Patheon transaction. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So we feel good about Q4. From that perspective, everything looks strong and solid. So I don't think there's much there. In terms of going into 2018, looking at the end markets, we'll obviously give the more holistic view for the year when we get on to the January call. But based on what's going on in Washington, we're expecting a budget to get into place with NIH growth towards the end of this year, which would set up as a positive for next year. Obviously, in industrial and applied, at the beginning of this year we're talking about a recovery, and obviously we're seeing good growth there. And pharma and biotech has been solid throughout the year. So at least as we see the world right now, we're entering 2018 with a lot of really good things going on. So I feel good about how the team is executing. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, that makes sense. And then I just wanted to nitpick the trends in Lab Products and Services a little bit, sequentially 3% growth, but a little bit softer. I think your overlapped the clinical trial logistics in the fourth quarter, but maybe just talk about the trends there and what we should think about comp-wise in 4Q. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So sequentially, really the impact is weather. It was fairly concentrated in that segment, so it was about a percentage of growth for the segment. That's really the sequential change. And then the clinical trial, we will sunset that by the end of Q4. There's still some run-over revenue that were lapping in Q4. We'd probably be done with that by the end of the year. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, Stephen. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Patrick Donnelly of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks, maybe one for Marc. Just on Patheon, I know it's early, but how are things compared to your expectations when it comes to utilization levels at the facilities? It feels like cost synergies are going to be driven more by improved efficiency there rather than facility consolidation. So I just wanted to hear your general thoughts now that you've had a chance to see them from the inside. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Patrick, great question. So I've had a chance to visit a number of the sites and meet with all the general managers of each of the sites and all the quality leaders. It's a really strong team. There's plenty of capacity to be leveraged, right? So what's exciting about the Patheon business is that it really is about driving operational efficiency and then leveraging our commercial reach to further fill up the plants. So incremental volumes really does flow through at an attractive rate. So driving the top line here is going to be a key driver, and our PPI Business System is going to help drive further benefits within the plants. Some of the cost synergies, obviously, is duplicative corporate costs and things of that sort. So you get those right away, and that flows quickly. And as we continue to drive volume growth, you'll see it flow through at an attractive rate. So it's early days but very, very encouraging, and we're looking forward to really leveraging our commercial infrastructure because the customer feedback has been great about the combination. So we're very bullish. It's early, but very bullish at this point. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then on industrial, I know in past quarters you talked about core industrial orders trending up a little bit in the U.S. and showing signs of life, and the hope was revenue would follow suit in the back half. Could you just talk about an update on the market there and how you feel? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes, so mid-single-digit growth in industrial, another quarter of growth in our chemical analysis business, really strong Analytical Instruments performance across chrome, mass spec, electron microscopy, environmental instruments, so good demand there. Asia-Pacific was very strong. The U.S. is growing but it's growing moderately. So that obviously still hasn't fully benefited from the recovery, but we're definitely seeing real strength in Asia. So pretty encouraging in terms of where industrial and applied is. And the applied markets continue to be very, very positive. And certainly, we saw that in our environmental instruments, and we just launched a new air monitor and that makes a difference for that marketplace as well. So really a much better part of the cycle than we've been reporting over the last couple of years. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Knight of Janney Montgomery. Your line is open. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hi, Marc. Can you talk about NIH, what you're seeing there? And then the second question I have is Europe has been better. Why do you think Europe is better? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So, Paul, thanks for the question. So in terms of academic and government, it was really good to see mid-single-digit growth globally. That's a very strong quarter. North America was consistent with the last few quarters with modest growth, and we're expecting an NIH budget to show an increase of $1 billion to $2 billion ultimately, and that should continue momentum into 2018 as well. So generally, conditions here in the U.S. are stable and growing modestly. Europe was very good, right? So we saw that across a variety of our instrument offerings. In particular, Germany was releasing funds, which was good, but we saw broad-based demand from a number of countries. So I think getting back to a more stable, growing European economy, you're seeing governments invest in academic and research, and that was a real positive in the quarter. And it was great to translate it into our whole business, which grew mid-single digits in Europe. So it's very encouraging. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : And then lastly, FEI, obviously a good quarter. How do you view that business in terms of predictability? It still has semiconductor exposure. Is there backlog, is there orders? What's your visibility on FEI going forward? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So orders grew strongly in the quarter. We have a very strong backlog and good visibility for the business. The life sciences business, you can think of it as a rapidly growing business, and therefore it's not really subject to the economic cycles as much. The materials science business does have a cyclical nature to it. It's in a really very positive part of the cycle. And as we read, certainly for the next quarter, that's very strong. The next year's comparison will be more challenging just given how strong the growth was this year, but we're very positive on the outlook for the electron microscopy business. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Steve. Stephen Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Most of them have been asked already. Just one question for you, Marc, on your AI business on LC and mass spec. I'm just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what you see going on there as it relates to the strength you're seeing. Is it your new products? Is it underlying market growth? Is it potential share gains in some of those markets? Just any more color there would be helpful. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: When I look at the chrome and mass spec growth that we've delivered for a number of quarters relative to what we can see from the external market, we've been gaining share, meaning we're growing faster than the others that are reporting the numbers. And as you recall, when you look at the growth, up until the last quarter or two, the chemical analysis business, which is not a mass spec business, had been declining. So when you looked at the segment, it looked like moderate growth, but underlying that was strong mass spectrometry growth. The reasons for that I think are twofold. One of the things is, as you advance technologies, it opens up new desire for the leading researchers to buy the products. So we continue to innovate, and therefore the funding cycle actually follows that innovation. So as long as the industry is bringing out relevant new products, these best researchers get the money. So the funding environment has been good. And ASMS was a great conference for us this year back in June, and it's rare that I highlight the quarter after product launches how well received they are, but our two triple-quads and our new Q Exactive really are off to a fantastic start. So it's a good market and really solid execution for share gain has been what's driving that. Stephen Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay, thanks very much. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from Catherine Schulte of Baird. Your line is open. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I was just thinking into the Analytical Instruments growth a little bit more. I'm wondering if you could walk it through by either end market or geography. I'm just trying to get a better sense of what was unique in this quarter to get to that 11% number. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: I think probably it's more the macro of chemical analysis growing versus being a headwind because they had been shirking for several years. It's been a couple quarters of growth. So that really makes a big difference. Even though it's moderate growth, it really does matter because chrome and mass spec has done well. And then we got some benefit from electron microscopy, which had a very strong quarter. So that combination really was the big driver. In terms of geography, the one area I would call out as being just very strong was Asia-Pacific. It was very good across all segments for our Analytical Instruments markets. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: And just as a reminder, the electron microscopy is currently showing up in industrial and applied and academic and government, where the concentration of revenue is. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just quickly on companion diagnostics, you have a number of FDA approvals under your belt and now starting to get some reimbursement. How big of a business do you think that could be in 2018? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: When I think about the programs in companion diagnostics, we are getting our lab partners up and running on our Oncomine Target DX companion diagnostic. LabCorp was up and running; more will get online. So that business will build throughout the fourth quarter and into 2018. As you know, the entire next-gen sequencing business is less than 2% of our total revenue. So it's not a huge business, but certainly the oncology portion is encouraging in terms of the actions going there. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great, thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Operator, we're going to take just one more. Operator : Your final question comes from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, my questions have been answered. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Great, Derik, thanks. So let me wrap it up. First of all, when I think about where we are at this point in the year, we're really in a great position to finish the year strongly, and I look forward to reporting a successful 2017 in January. Of course, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

So, with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our 2017 Q4 call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered an outstanding year. We achieved strong growth in revenues and earnings; we executed well to take advantage of good conditions across our end-markets; and we became a stronger partner for our customers by successfully executing our growth strategy and completing strategic M&A. The excellent progress we made in 2017 has significantly strengthened our leadership position and sets up very well for the year ahead. We have a lot to cover this morning. So, I will hit just some of the highlights from the quarter and the year. Let me begin with our financial performance, starting with the quarter. We delivered very strong adjusted earnings per share growth in Q4 with a 16% increase to $2.79 per share. Our revenue in the quarter increased 22% year-over-year to $6.05 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 18% to $1.45 billion and our adjusted operating margin in Q4 was 24%.  Turing to our result for the full year. We extended our long track record of consistently delivering strong earnings performance in 2017 with a 15% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $9.49 per share. We increased revenues by 14% for the full year to $20.92 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 15% to $4.86 billion with adjusted operating margin of 23.2%. So, it was a great year. Our team did an excellent job of driving our growth initiatives forward and successfully completing and integrating new acquisitions. As a result of their efforts, we\u2019re in a stronger position to serve our customers, provide opportunities for our collogues and create value for our shareholders. Turning to our performance by end market. Conditions were strong and we executed very well to take advantage of our growth opportunities. I will give you some specific commentary on the quarter and a little additional color on our results for the year. Starting with pharma and biotech. We delivered strong growth in Q4 across all of our businesses that serve these customers including good contributions from our bioproduction and clinical trials businesses. This resulted in 10% growth for the quarter in this end market. We continue to capitalize on the underlying strength of pharma and biotech and the deep relationships we\u2019ve built over time to deliver our unique value proposition for these customers. Our leading position in this end market, led to high single digit growth for the year. In academic and government, we grew in the high single digits during the quarter. Geographically, we performed well across our key regions; and from a product perspective, we saw a strong demand for our mass spectrometry and electron microscopy systems. For the full year, we delivered mid single digit growth in this end market. In diagnostics and health care, we were pleased to deliver a very good quarter with high single digit growth. Our performance in this end market was driven primarily by strength in our seasonal businesses as well as good demand for our biomarker tests. For the full year, our growth here was in the low single digits. Last, in industrial and applied, we achieved mid single digit growth for the quarter and the year. In Q4, we saw strength across our various businesses serving this customer base. In particular, it was great to see continued good growth in our chemical analysis business. So, to summarize our performance. Good market conditions across the board and great execution by our teams led to strong growth for the year. Now, let me shift gears to talk about our accomplishments in the context of our growth strategy, which is based on our ability to continuously develop high impact, innovative new products, leverage our scale in emerging markets and deliver a unique value proposition to our customers. I\u2019m pleased with the excellent progress we made in 2017 in all three elements of our strategy. Starting with innovation. This is one of our core values as a Company, and we invested about $900 million in R&D, in 2017. We had a number of milestones during the year across all of our key technology platforms, and I am going to cover some of the highlights. First, the mass spectrometry. We continued to build on the long-term success of our Orbitrap platform by launching the Thermo Scientific Q Exactive HF-X system for life sciences research. We also expanded our offering for applied markets for the new triple-stage quadrupole instruments. Turning to electron microscopy. It\u2019s been a little over year since we acquired FEI, and we launched a number of new products since then, among the highlights for material science applications, we expanded our Thermo Scientific Helios G4 DualBeam platform and for structural biology, new systems such as our Thermo Scientific Krios G3i are helping us to increase our presence in that fast-growing market. You may recall that the winners of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry achieved breakthrough developments in structural biology using our cryo-EM technologies. This is a terrific business that we continue to make even stronger through our leading presence in pharma and biotech. In Specialty Diagnostics, we launched a number of new assays during the year. This included receiving FDA clearance to expand the use of our BRAHMS PCT test as a biomarker for bacterial infection, helping doctors to make better decisions regarding the use of antibiotics. We have a number of highlights in our genetic analysis business as well and the most significant was our new Applied Biosystems SeqStudio instrument for Sanger sequencing. This cloud-enabled system was designed for simplicity and affordability to serve customers working in low to mid throughput laboratories. Especially exciting were two new cancer treatment breakthroughs that in 2017 were enabled through our innovations. One was the first FDA-approved companion diagnostic for non-small cell lung cancer using our NGS-based Oncomine Dx Target Test; another was the first FDA-approved CAR-T immunotherapy for treating a specific form of childhood leukemia which use our Dynabeads technology. These are both examples of our significant contributions towards advancing precision medicine which will continue to be a priority for us going forward. Turning to the second element of our growth strategy. We continue to leverage our scale to drive growth in emerging markets. As of year-end these high-growth regions represent 21% of our total revenue. China, India, and South Korea all delivered strong growth. China grew in the high teens once again in 2017, and remains a key growth market for us, constituting about 10% of our total revenue today. We continue to fuel the long-term growth in China through targeted investments. And during the year, we opened two new customer demo centers that showcased our leadership in electron microscopy and precision medicine. These new capabilities are helping us to capitalize on the priorities outlined in China\u2019s five-year plan. We\u2019ve also invested significantly in our digital capabilities and are pleased that our ecommerce revenues in China grew 50% in 2017. In addition to China, we\u2019ve continued to increase our scale and depth of capabilities across emerging markets from India to the Middle East to Southeast Asia. Turning to our customer value proposition which is the third element of our growth strategy. We invested significantly to enhance our offering through a number of strategic acquisitions during the year. In Q4, we completed two small bolt-on acquisitions that expand our air quality monitoring and scanning electron microscopy platforms. As you know, the most significant transaction from 2017 was our acquisition of Patheon, a leading provider of contract development and manufacturing services for pharma and biotech customers. These capabilities are a perfect complement to our leading clinical trials logistics services and allowed us to create a $3 billion pharma services business. We\u2019ve owned Patheon for about five months, the integration is proceeding well, and we\u2019re on track to achieve our cost and revenue synergy targets for year one. I recently met with our sales team in this business to help them kick off the year. They\u2019re super excited about the opportunities they have as part of Thermo Fisher and I believe their enthusiasm is a reflection of what they\u2019re hearing directly from our pharma and biotech customers. I\u2019d also like to update you on the Patheon site in Puerto Rico that was impacted by the damage to the island\u2019s power infrastructure after the hurricane. Our teams there really stepped up, and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the way they responded, making sure all of their colleagues were safe and getting the facility back on line to help our customers deliver critical medicines to patients. The site began shipping in late Q4 and was fully operational as we entered 2018. Turning to capital deployment, 2017 was another very active year for us. All told, we deployed $7.8 billion on M&A to expand our customer offering and strengthen the strategic position of Thermo Fisher. Looking forward, we continue to have a very active M&A pipeline. We\u2019re focused on paying down debt and we\u2019re committed to driving high returns from the investments we\u2019ve made. We also returned $1 billion of capital to our shareholders in 2017 through stock buybacks and dividends. As we said in the past, we intend to grow our dividend over time. And this morning, we announced that we increased our dividend by 13%. Returning capital remains an important part of our overall capital deployment strategy. Before I wrap up, let me make a quick comment on the other announcement we made this morning. As you know, the new tax law is a real positive for Thermo Fisher and will further lower our tax rate. We\u2019ve decided to reinvest some of the benefit in our colleagues, customers and communities. In 2017, we invested $34 million of the tax benefit by paying a one-time bonus to all of our non-executive colleagues around the world as a way to thank them for their commitment to our success. In 2018, we\u2019ll invest $16 million to accelerate breakthrough R&D programs and also to increase the impact of our STEM education and sustainability activities. We\u2019re pleased to take advantage of this unique opportunity to complement our ongoing investments in Thermo Fisher\u2019s future growth. So to summarize, our strong Q4 really capped off a great year. Our teams executed very well to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth. We strengthened our leadership by advancing our growth strategy and continuing to gain share. We also continued to successfully execute our M&A strategy to create significant value for our customers and our shareholders. Looking ahead, as you\u2019d expect, we\u2019re planning to extend our long track record of consistent, strong financial performance in 2018. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly hit the highlights. In terms of our revenue, we expect to deliver from $23.42 billion to $23.72 billion in 2018 which would result in 12% to 13% growth over 2017. We\u2019re initiating adjusted EPS guidance for 2018 in the range of $10.68 to $10.88 per share. This would lead to 13% to 15% growth over the strong adjusted EPS performance we delivered this past year. Our excellent result in 2017 really sets us up for another successful year ahead. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll take you through our fourth quarter and full year results of the total Company, then, I\u2019ll provide some color on our four segments, and conclude with a detailed review of our 2018 guidance. Before I get into the details of our financial performance, I thought it would be helpful to provide a high level view of how the fourth quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. As you saw in our press release, we had a strong finish to the year and delivered 8% organic growth in Q4. This was driven by good market conditions and great operational execution. From an earning stand point, we delivered adjusted earnings per share that was $0.15 higher than the midpoint of our previous guidance. This was driven by pull-through on our organic growth and more favorable FX environment, and good performance from the Patheon acquisition, partially offset by the $34 million onetime bonus for our non-executive collogues across the Company that Marc highlighted. So, for the year as a whole, we delivered 5% organic growth, 15% growth in adjusted earnings per share and $3.5 billion of free cash flow. So, overall, excellent financial results in 2017. So, now, let me give you more color on our performance. Starting with adjusted earnings per share. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS in Q4 by 16% to $2.79. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $9.49, up 15% versus 2016. As you know, U.S. tax reform legislation was enacted during the quarter. And as we expected, it will have a positive impact on the Company. I will cover the 2018 impact in detail in the guidance section of my comments later on. The impact of the legislation on Q4 2017 was a onetime GAAP only charge of $204 million. This represents the transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by the remeasurement impact of U.S. deferred tax balances at the new lower corporate tax rates. As a result, GAAP EPS in the quarter was $1.30, down 18% from Q4 last year and for the full year 2017 was $5.59, up 10% versus 2016. On the top-line, in Q4, our reported revenue increased 22% year-over-year. The components of our Q4 revenue included 8% organic growth and 11% impact of acquisitions and the 3% tailwind from foreign exchange. For the full year, 2017 reported revenue increased 14% year-over-year. The 2017 reported revenue includes 5% organic growth and 9% impact from acquisitions and an immaterial impact from foreign exchange. Looking at our growth by geography in Q4. North America grew in the high single digits, Europe grew mid single digits, Asia Pacific grew in the low teens with another strong contribution from China which grew in the high teens, and the rest of the world grew in the low teens. For the full year, all geographies grew in the mid single digits except for Asia Pacific, which grew 10%. Turning to our operational performance. Q4 adjusted operating income increased 18% and adjusted operating margin was 24%, down 80 basis points from Q4 of last year. As a reminder, Patheon is a scale acquisition with gross margins and operating income margins lower than our Company average and was just over 80 basis points dilutive to total adjusted operating margins in the quarter. The addition of Patheon will continue to be dilutive to our adjusted operating margins over the first 12 months of ownership. The one-time bonus payments to our non-executive colleagues was a cost in Q4 2017 and was dilutive to adjusted operating margins by 70 basis points in the quarter. So, our underlying operational performance was strong in the quarter at 70 basis points of expansion, driven by very good volume pull-through and productivity, partially offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 15% and adjusted operating margin was 23.2%, up 10 basis points from 2016, in line with our expectations. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total Company adjusted gross margin came in at 47% in the quarter, down 240 basis points from the prior year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 48.2%, down 60 basis points from 2016. For both the quarter and the full year, gross margin contraction was driven by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and unfavorable business mix; this was partially offset by strong productivity. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 19.2% of revenue, which is down a 110 basis points versus Q4 of 2016, and R&D expense came in at 3.9% of revenue, down 40 basis points versus Q4 of last year. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 20.7%, down 90 basis points compared to full year 2016, and R&D expense was 4.2% of sales, up 10 basis points compared to the prior year, and R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue for the year was 6.6%. Looking at our results below the line. The net interest expense in Q4 was $146 million, which is $29 million higher than Q4 last year, mainly as a result of the incremental debt related to our capital deployment activities this year. Net interest expense for the full year was $511 million, an increase of $90 million from 2016. Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense in the quarter at $3 million, which is $14 million unfavorable versus Q4 2016, driven primarily by changes in non-operating FX. Our adjusted tax rate was 13.3% in the quarter, right in line with our prior guidance; this is a 130 basis-point lower than Q4 2016 due to the timing of discreet tax planning items as well as the impact of Patheon. Our full year adjusted tax rate was 13%, which is 80 basis points lower than full year 2016. Q4 average diluted shares were 405 million, slightly higher than our previous guidance of 404.5 million due to slightly higher option dilution. For the full year, average diluted shares were 398 million, up 0.5 million from 2016. For the full year, FX was a year-over-year tailwind of $70 million on revenue and immaterial impact on adjusted operating income. Other income had an $11 million FX headwind for the full year, resulting in a $0.02 headwind on adjusted EPS from FX in 2017. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the full year, cash flow from continuing operations was $4 billion and free cash flow was $3.5 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of approximately $500 million that is $665 million higher than 2016 and ahead of our previous guidance, primarily due to strong operational performance and effective working capital management. During 2017 we continued returning capital to shareholders with $750 million of share buybacks and $240 million in dividends. As Marc mentioned, we successfully deployed capital to strengthen our customer value proposition through strategic acquisitions including Patheon as well as a number of smaller bolt-on acquisitions. All told, our total capital deployment in 2017 was approximately $8.8 billion. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, just slightly higher than normal as we were preparing to pay down a $450 million senior note in the first week in January. We finished the year with total debt of $21 billion, down $1 billion from the end of Q3, driven by debt pay down during the quarter. Our leverage ratio at the end of the year was 4 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA on a reported basis, which is down from 4.4 times at the end of Q3 and in line with our expectations. So, wrapping up my comments, our total Company performance, we continued to drive strong ROIC performance in 2017. Adjusted ROIC at the end of 2017 was 10%; this is up 10 basis points compared to the prior year, demonstrating the strength of our underlying businesses offsetting the impact of a significant capital added from our acquisition activity in 2017. So, with that, I\u2019ll now provide you some color on the performance of our four business segments, starting with Life Sciences Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 11% and organic revenue growth was 8% in Q4. We saw strong growth across the segment, particularly in our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. For the full year, reported revenue increased 8% and organic revenue growth was 6%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 20% and adjusted operating margin was 35.6%, which is 270 basis points higher than Q4 of 2016. Adjusted operating margin expansion was driven by strong productivity as well as volume pull-through and foreign exchange; this was partially offset by strategic investments. For the full year 2017, adjusted operating margin was 33.1%, an increase of 310 basis points over 2016. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 16% and organic revenue growth was 11% in Q4. In the quarter, we benefited from strong growth contributions across all of our businesses within this segment. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment increased 31% and organic growth was 9%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 16% and adjusted operating margin was flat year-over-year at 24.5%. In the quarter, we saw a very strong productivity and volume pull-through; this was offset by the impact of strategic investments, foreign exchange and unfavorable business mix. For the full year 2017, adjusted operating income increased 38% and adjusted operating margin was 21.3%, 100 basis points higher than 2016. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q4, reported revenue increased 10% and organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter, we had strong growth in seasonal products and good performance in our clinical and transplant diagnostics businesses. For the full year, we grew both reported and organic revenue 4%. Adjusted operating income grew 6% in Q4 compared to 2016 and adjusted operating margin was 26.5%, down 70 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin within the quarter benefited from positive contributions of our PPI Business System and volume pull-through; however, this is more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. For the full year 2017, adjusted operating income increased 2% and adjusted operating margin was 26.7%, down 50 basis points from 2016. And finally, I will cover the Laboratory Products and Services segment, which as a reminder, includes the Patheon acquisition. In this segment, Q4 reported revenue increased 43% and organic revenue growth was 9%. Our channel business once again delivered strong organic growth from the quarter and it\u2019s good to see all businesses in this segment growing well, including the clinical trials logistics business. For the full year, reported revenue increased 16% and organic growth was 5%. In Q4, adjusted operating income in the segment increased 28% and adjusted operating margin was 12.5%, down 150 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin benefited from strong volume pull-through and the accretive impact on the segment from acquisitions; this is more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. For the full year 2017, adjusted operating income increased 4% and adjusted operating margin was 12.9%, down 150 basis points compared to the prior year. With that, I would like to review the details of our 2018 guidance. As Marc mentioned, we\u2019re initiating a 2018 adjusted EPS guidance range of $10.68 to $10.88, which is a 13% to 15% growth over 2017. In terms of revenue, our guidance range is $23.42 billion to $23.72 billion, which is growth of 12% to 13% over 2017. And for 2018, we\u2019re expecting to deliver between 4% and 5% organic revenue growth. Let me now cover the key assumptions that we factored into our guidance. We\u2019re assuming this foreign exchange is a $300 million revenue tailwind to 2018, which should represent a positive impact of just over 1%. This reflects the average of rates over the past two months. We assume that this pull through at approximately 20%, given our current mix of currencies, the addition of Patheon and potential transactional FX. This translates to an EPS tailwind from FX of $0.13 or just over 1%. We expect acquisitions completed in 2017 will contribute 7% to our reported revenue growth in 2018. From an adjusted operating margin standpoint, as I mentioned earlier, Patheon\u2019s margin profile is lower than the average of the Company, so it will be dilutive to the overall operating margins until the anniversary date in late August. The impact of this in 2018 is 50 basis points of dilution. Despite this headwind, we\u2019re still expecting to deliver 20 to 30 basis points of expansion year-over-year in 2018, reflecting strong operational performance. Moving below the line, we expect net interest expense to be in the range of $550 million to $555 million, about $40 higher than 2017, primarily as a result of the debt we took on for acquisitions in 2017 and assumed rate increases in 2018. For guidance purposes, I\u2019ve assumed that the Fed increases rate 25 basis points per quarter in 2018. We\u2019re assuming other income and expense will be an immaterial net expense in 2018. As I mentioned earlier, as expected, the impact of U.S. tax reform is a positive for the company. As a result, in 2018, we\u2019re assuming an adjusted income tax rate of 12%; this compares to 13% for 2017. The detailed regulations supporting the new tax law are still being finalized by the U.S. Treasury. But, based on where we anticipate the final wording to land, factoring in our tax planning activities, we expect no cash impact from the transition tax charge that we incurred in Q4 of 2017. And in addition for 2018, we expect cash taxes to be slightly lower than the adjusted P&L tax cost. We\u2019re assuming net capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million to $730 million for the year. The increase over 2017 is due to the timing of projects and the full year impact of Patheon. We anticipate receiving approximately $30 million of customer funding towards this CapEx. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $3.8 billion in 2018; the increase over 2017 is mainly due to higher earnings. And in terms of capital deployment, we\u2019re assuming that we\u2019ll return approximately $275 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, reflecting the increase in dividend we announced earlier today. Our guidance also assumes a total of $500 million of share buybacks in 2018, which we assume will be completed during the second half of the year. We estimate that the full year average diluted shares will be in the range of 405 million to 407 million, up approximately 8 million from the average in 2017, primarily due to the equity offering last year. Our guidance assumes that we\u2019ll continue to use excess cash to reduce debt and as always does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures. And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year. In terms of organic revenue growth, we\u2019re expecting Q2 and Q3 to be slightly higher than the average for the year. This phasing is driven by the timing of holidays in the first half of the year and strong comps in Q4. In terms of adjusted EPS, we\u2019re expecting the same phasing as 2017 when you look at each quarter as a percentage of the total year. And as always in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view on how we see the year playing out. So, in summary, we delivered excellent financial results in 2017 and look forward to doing the same in 2018. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth Apicerno : Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we are ready to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : Marc, I wanted to start off with biopharma, obviously great growth there, 10%. Just wondering if you can provide a little bit more color, any budget flush dynamic? Can you comment on January trends? And then, as we think about bioprocess, any commentary there? We\u2019ve seen some good results out from your peers. So, can you guide us through kind of the inventory destock noise that we heard earlier last year? Marc Casper : Yes. We had a very good year in pharmaceutical and biotech with high single-digit growth for the year, and in the fourth quarter was 10%. So, when I think about the fourth quarter, we really had strong quarter across the board, biosciences, analytical instruments, our research channel all did very well; bioproduction was very strong; clinical trials business, logistics business also grew, so really very positive. The way I see, the customers really understand the value we bring and we continue to gain share there. From a bioproduction standpoint, it was a good year for bioproduction, grew above the Company average. And as you know, we\u2019re very bullish about the mid and long term prospects for that business; it\u2019s got great tailwinds from a macro perspective. And we like the way we finished the year with a quarter of very strong growth. Tycho Peterson : And then, for the follow-up the Lab Products and Services had a big step up sequentially here. Can you maybe just comment on what drove that? And I think you called that academic being up high single digits, just curious what the driver there was. Marc Casper : The Lab Products and Services, really a very strong performance across all of the businesses. Our channel business had a very good end to the year. And sequentially, really one of the big drivers was our clinical trials logistic businesses returned to nice growth, right. As we mentioned a year plus ago, we\u2019re going to have a difficult first three quarters just based on a large study cancelation late in 2016. So, once we anniversaried that, you saw that business, which was great tailwind, returned to nice growth. So that\u2019s probably the biggest sequential change in that business. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then, can you just comment on the academic high single digit growth? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Marc Casper : Yes. So, academic and government was very strong in the quarter. We saw a good growth across all of the key geographies and we saw really good growth in our analytical instruments, particularly mass spectrometry and electron microscopy in that segment. Operator : Your next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ross Muken : Good morning guys and I appreciate the whole organization welcoming back with such a good quarter. So, Marc, obviously, the macro backdrop is pretty good and the end markets you serve are quite healthy. But, it still feels like last 12 to 24 months incrementally your business is sort of doing better than peers. And it feels like whether it\u2019s mix or share or new technologies, you guys have been kind of gaining momentum on the top line. And so, how, when you think about sort of the more recent performance, are you kind of teasing out? How much of this is sort of the macro and some of the markets or some of the acquisitions versus some of the hard work the organization\u2019s doing to really have better results on the organic line? Marc Casper : So, Ross, thanks for the question. And obviously, the end markets are good. And the biggest change really in 2017 was that industrial and applied turned back to mid single digit growth. So, that helps the industry, and obviously we benefited from it. But, we are performing much stronger over the last couple of years, as you highlighted, based on the success of the growth strategy. And when I think about last year, we delivered 5% organic growth and we would have delivered 5% organic growth even if you took out the contribution from FEI in the organic growth. So, we had a really strong year across the business. And it was really good execution. Our channel business had another really good year, when you look at our analytical instruments business, strength across the portfolio, and it was a good year on spend. So, all of those factors contributed to a very strong 2017, and it\u2019s another step up in performance in terms of our strategy. Ross Muken : That\u2019s helpful. And may be just on China, I mean, lot of attention being focused there. You guys had another fantastic year. In terms of sort of differentiating between both the industrial and biopharma side there, how are you seeing sort of trends and how are you thinking about comps in that region as we enter next year and what\u2019s kind of the assumption baked into the 2018 guide. Marc Casper : We continue to expect that China is going to be our fastest growing major geography within the Company. Our book to bill was above 1 in China and momentum is strong. There is a tremendous amount of interest in the diagnostics area, expanding healthcare and the applied markets, food safety, environmental protection. We\u2019re obviously benefiting a little bit from the industrial recovery as well, but it\u2019s really the alignment with the five-year plan that\u2019s driving the strong growth. And while we obviously will have a challenging comparison in 2018 in China, the team is off to a good start. Operator : Your next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin : So, just one cleanup question and one other one. So, on Q4, can you sort of break out -- you can do this as an aggregate; they don\u2019t have to be individual. But, sort of like what you thought the contributions were from the flu season being stronger, hurricane catch-up, any sort of budget flushes? I\u2019m basically just trying to figure it out to like model Q4 2018 better. Marc Casper : Yes. So, I guess, the way I characterized the quarter, no real hurricane catch-up; we didn\u2019t see a significant impact in Q3 and it might be a small amount but really nothing creating the noise. The seasonal products were very strong. So, that\u2019s probably about half a percentage point in the quarter and then it\u2019s really about year-over-year spending at the end of the year by our customers, was slightly weaker last year, saw a good strength this year. So, maybe, in total a couple of points. Derik de Bruin : Okay, great. Thanks. That\u2019s really helpful. And just I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to actually ask you a DNA sequencing question but I\u2019m going to. You\u2019ve made a lot of news -- there has been a lot of news following your sequencing business in 2017. And I\u2019m just wondering it\u2019s been a while since we sort of have an update on the overall size of that business and sort of like how the business has been growing. Can you guys provide us that? And then, I want to ask what sort of drove the decision to sort of do the relationship with Illumina for the AmpliSeq product? Marc Casper : Derik, in terms of next gen sequencing, represents just under 2% of our revenue in kind of order of magnitude. It\u2019s a business that is growing reasonably well. We\u2019ve had a lot of good product launches during the course of 2017. At the very beginning of this year, we announced a new line of sequencers, two new Oncomine panels, one focused on immuno-oncology, which is obviously very important; and one focused on liquid biopsy. The early feedback from customers on all of the new products is very positive. We\u2019re also launching in chemistry for our sequencers. Terms of Illumina obviously they have a very large install base of instruments. And our amplification chemistry is very well regarded. And we made the decision to supply them with those chemistries so that they can mark it on their install base. And we felt like that\u2019s a good growth opportunity. And given the fact that we continue to launch new products, we were comfortable with that combination of moves. Operator : Your next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Doug Schenkel : So, you closed out 2017 with your net debt to EBITDA ratio below 4 times, as currently built, we see that getting close to 3 times by the end of this year. Is it fair to say that you\u2019re open for business for the right acquisition, based on where your balance sheet is today? And if so, I guess, a multiparter here, how should we think about your capacity, how do we think about the application of your typical ROI criteria in the continue high valuation environment, and how does certainty, on the tax law, impact the M&A environment? Marc Casper : Yes. We\u2019re open for business and being here time, we\u2019ve never been closed. But, we have a very active pipeline. And part of the reason the way we financed the Patheon acquisition was we issued some level -- modest level of equity as part of that, so that we would never take ourselves out of the market at this point in time, because the Patheon integration really is only one narrow part of the Company. So, we felt like we had the management bandwidth to push through good opportunities. And so, we\u2019re in that mode. We really have a substantial amount of capacity. So, I don\u2019t feel constrained financially in terms of deal size from that perspective. In terms of ROI on transactions, as you\u2019ve heard me say in the past, when valuations are higher, we always have used the criteria that we don\u2019t do bad transactions, meaning that we really focus on the downside scenario of the transaction and ensure that we\u2019re going to drive good returns, even if something doesn\u2019t work out. So, it does inform the kinds of transactions that we do in this type of market. And if you look at it, we avoided speculative transactions, we bought really great businesses. FEI is a good example where it\u2019s a business that we spent years looking at and thinking about, understanding the business and bought it at a part of the cycle where it was growing around 3%, we were able to grow it in the first year of ownership in the strong double digits. And that\u2019s kind of a nose we have for M&A. So, we\u2019ll buy things that we feel we understand the downside scenario with and are going to make good returns for our shareholders on ROI under all the different scenarios that are possible. Doug Schenkel : And I just want to go back to two topics that came up earlier in the Q&A session but I don\u2019t think were addressed completely clearly. First, just to be clear, based on what you\u2019re seeing thus far in 2018, are you confident that there was no meaningful pull forward of revenue into Q4 at the expense of Q1? And on the question of bioproduction destocking, the dynamic that was out there across the industry earlier in 2017, are you confident that that\u2019s largely abated? Marc Casper : So, I\u2019ve never heard someone say to answer that question. So, that\u2019s a first. So, Doug, I guess, the year\u2019s off to a good start consistent with our guidance. When I look at how bookings were for the last year, they were above 1. So, we enter the year with a good backlog, and there\u2019s nothing unusual about how the year started that would indicate some sort of customer pull forward or something that was meaningful. So, I think that\u2019s the view. In terms of bioproduction, it\u2019s a business we\u2019ve been in for a very, very long time. We really don\u2019t spend a lot of intellectual energy around quarter-to-quarter movements there because customers shouldn\u2019t pull forward and push out orders all the time. What I would say is that the pipeline is strong, the business had a very good year and the customer activity is really positive. So, we feel good about the outlook for that business for 2018 and feel like the end was a good sign. But, we don\u2019t get too hung up on as a quarter strong or weak. It\u2019s business as lumpy and that\u2019s why I said the mid-term and long-term look really excellent for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to start with Patheon. Could you give us an update on the outsourcing discussions there with customers since the acquisition, just traction on revenue synergies? And then, has the dialogue changed at all since the beginning of the year with tax reform? Marc Casper : Yes. Jack, thank you for the question, good morning. In terms of performance services business or Patheon, the customer feedback has been incredibly positive and we\u2019re having meaningful dialogue with a number of customers. This is a business that doesn\u2019t turn quickly in terms of there\u2019s a long process of getting products, tech transfer and things of that sort. But nonetheless, the early feedback is very good and the revenue synergy work -- we already have achieved some revenue synergies between our clinical trials logistics business and our new pharma services capabilities. So, those are happening and they will ramp up over time. We have really interesting work going on with our bioproduction business and the biologics portion of that business as well. So, we\u2019re very bullish about the revenue growth outlook in the midterm for that business. On the tax side of the equation, I think really the pharmaceutical customers have to think through how does the tax law change their manufacturing strategy because a lot of their older strategies were about putting plants in low tax jurisdictions of which some of the advantages to those are no longer as compelling. And therefore, it\u2019s possible that opens up new opportunities over time. So, that\u2019s something that we will continue to explore with our customers. Jack Meehan : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And just if I could step back, you have long term organic growth target of 4 to 6%, you ended 2017 with a lot of momentum and portfolio is moving in the faster growing areas with FEI and Patheon. Just how would you frame the guidance of 4 to 5% in that context and what are some of the puts and takes as you sit here today? Marc Casper : Yes. As we\u2019ve thought about the outlook for the year, we felt good about the 4 to 5% initial guidance for organic growth. And the way we think about it is, as the year unfolds, obviously we adjust the guidance. We felt like -- we like the way the end markets are, we like the way the year ended, we obviously feel good about our orders as well. The things that we will pay attention to later in the year is we\u2019re going to have a challenging fourth quarter comparison because of the year-end. So, we\u2019re assuming in the guidance a normal year-end spend as opposed to the very strong year-end spend. So, that\u2019s one we\u2019re not going to know obviously until the fourth quarter, but that would be one of the factors. And then, obviously, if GDP growth continues to accelerate, which appears to be accelerating around the world that obviously could be a tailwind as well. And you could flip it the other way on what would be things that would be headwinds would be if it goes in the opposite direction. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Beuchaw : First question is with regard to the analytical instruments business. You saw a nice pick-up there recently. It would be helpful, if you could sort of talk through what you saw second half of the year in a retrospective. How much of this is improvement in the end markets and how much of it is new product flow? And then, for 2018, any color you can give us on how you\u2019re thinking about modeling the business would be really helpful, not only with regard to the sustainability of some of those divers but because we\u2019re including FDI in the organic component, which can be a pretty significant benefit to the organic profile of that business. Thanks. Marc Casper : So, in terms of looking back, and then I will talk looking forward. Looking back in the second half, we obviously had good new products across the portfolio. So, that\u2019s a contributor, mass spectrometry big beneficiary, electron microscopy as well. The other thing in second half is our chemical analysis business, particularly our handheld portable instruments, which kind of represents short cycle industrial recovery, was very good. So, it was very broad base in terms of the growth and the instruments business throughout the year and in the second half. As I think about 2018 and FEI and how to think about it. FEI had very strong growth; our electron microscopy had very strong growth in 2017. That makes for a challenging comparison this year. We anticipate that the business will be a contributor to our growth and grow above the Company average during the course of this year. So, it\u2019s how we would think about it, based on a spectacular 2017, and we see momentum continuing into 2018, but obviously not as big of contributor because of the comparison. Steve Beuchaw : And then, just a couple of housekeeping items, one is, I wonder if you could speak at all what fourth quarter underlying growth was in Patheon, how the impact of some of the Puerto Rico challenges impacted that and do we capture some of that back in the first quarter potentially? And then, Stephen, could you give us any sense for what the working capital outlook is year-on-year embedded in the guidance assumption for free cash flow? Marc Casper : In terms of Puerto Rico, we don\u2019t believe that we will see a pickup in Q1 at normal rates. But, the customers effectively had big products they had to source, so likely bought the product form other source at that point. We may see a little bit of uptick during the course of the year, but I wouldn\u2019t think that\u2019s a particularly big factor. Underlying growth for the Patheon business for 2017, if you -- obviously not in our numbers but mid single digit year-over-year growth for that business. So, solid growth here and obviously they had headwind. So, I feel good about performance there. Stephen Williamson : In terms of working capital assumption for 2018, it is essentially kind of a normal year of need for working capital to grow the business organically at the 4% to 5% level, so not expecting a significant difference in the norm there. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Maybe just following up on Jack\u2019s question about the long-term organic growth rate, 4 to 6. In the past, you\u2019ve always talked about one end market has been a headwind, preventing you from getting towards the upper end. But, in the current setup, I know Marc you noted a few weeks ago, end markets are as healthy as they\u2019ve been. Do you view 2018 as the best shot you can recall getting towards that 6% number, assuming the current macro backdrop holds up and you have full year of FEI contribution? Marc Casper : Every year we\u2019re always working to maximize the performance of the Company and strengthen the strategic position. And as we go into the year, we feel good about the outlook. And historically, we\u2019ve generally been around 4% as our opening view on organic growth; and this year, obviously, we did 4% to 5%. So, it reflects the momentum. And we\u2019ll drive to the best possible performance. Patheon is not a big contributor to our organic growth this year; it doesn\u2019t flow in until the final four months of the year. So, while it\u2019ll contribute, it is not going to contribute meaningfully to organic growth this year. So, we\u2019re going to deliver four really strong quarters, and we\u2019ll see ultimately where that winds up in terms of organic growth. Patrick Donnelly : And then, obviously, your LPS results speak for themselves to a degree but would appreciate if you could just maybe provide some color on the Amazon threat to your business. It seems like that\u2019s got a little more air time this past quarter, in spite of their presence not being particularly new. So, have you seen any change in the market from them, are you expecting anything different? We would appreciate your thoughts? Marc Casper : In Amazon, we take it extraordinarily seriously, right? And we\u2019ve taken it extraordinarily seriously over the last five years as they thought about and tried different things in this market, and they\u2019ve largely been unsuccessful, and there\u2019re reasons for that. And I think a lot of the reasons for that is that we\u2019re relentlessly focused on doing a great job for our customers. And many of you have heard me say, we\u2019re the Amazon of scientific supplies. We do a great job of aggregating a complex set of categories, providing a very cost effective way for our customers to drive productivity, world-class logistics, on-site personnel handling very technically difficult products, hazardous fluids, refrigeration, we have great supplier relationships. And at the end of the day, we\u2019ve built an amazing web capability to make it very easy for our customers to transact with us. So, we\u2019ll take it very seriously. We have seen momentum from Amazon. And we\u2019ve had great performance in our channel business the last couple of years and ended on the strong note. So, we\u2019ll continue to pay attention to it, but feel good about our competitive position. Patrick Donnelly : Very helpful. Thanks. Marc Casper : Operator, we have time for just one more. Operator : Okay. Your next question comes from Dan Arias from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Dan Arias : Marc, just following up on academic, what\u2019s your assumption for NIH funding this year? Obviously some good legislation out there, but it kind of also feels like we could live in continuing resolution land for a while, so just wondering whether your base case, so to speak, as U.S. funding going up in fiscal 2018? Marc Casper : In terms of the outlook for academic and government for the year, we\u2019re assuming in our guidance low to mid single digit growth. We\u2019re assuming that we will get a budget at some point in the year and that in that there\u2019d be a modest level of growth. And that\u2019s why you have the range for the segment between low and mid single digits, just depends on when a budget gets passed. I did have a chance to meet with NIH leadership recently. And they\u2019re operating under a stable environment and expect over time when the budget gets passed, it should get better. If I think about the other end markets, diagnostics and health care, we\u2019re also assuming low to mid single digit growth for this year; pharma and biotech, we\u2019re assuming mid to high single digit; in industrial, we\u2019re assuming mid single digit. It kind of gives you a holistic view of the year. Dan Arias : Yes. That\u2019s great. Thank you. And then maybe just one for Stephen. Stephen, what is necessary for LPS margin to be up in 2018? It looks like you\u2019ll be up against a favorable comp obviously but just wondering more fundamentally what the key factors are to getting back to the mid teens. Stephen Williamson : So, I think the individual businesses are doing well; it\u2019s really been around business mix has been driving the change; this year has been the principal driver. You\u2019re going to see actually benefit from margins from Patheon through the anniversary date for the LPS side of the equation. So, I guess the underlying businesses are actually doing well. Marc Casper : So, let me wrap up the call with a couple of quick comments, the first of which is I\u2019d like to thank Seth Hoogasian, our General Counsel who\u2019s been our General Counsel for more than 20 years, retiring at the end of the quarter. He\u2019s been the silent right hand of the management team for a long period of time. And we wish him a happy retirement and thank him for his service to the Company. And then for the reflection of the year, obviously, 2017 was an excellent year and has put us in a great position to achieve our growth goals for the year. And as always, thank you for the ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. And I look forward to interacting with you during the course of the year. Thanks, everyone.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would like to introduce our moderator for the call today, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts and Presentations, until May 11, 2018. A copy of the press release of our first quarter 2018 earnings and future expectations is available on the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Results.

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our Q1 call. As you saw in our press release, we had a very strong start to the year. We achieved excellent growth in revenue and earnings. Our team executed well to capitalize on the good market conditions, and we continued to successfully execute our growth strategy by building on our innovation leadership, leveraging our global scale and strengthening our customer value proposition. Our great performance in Q1 sets us up to deliver another outstanding year. Let me begin with our financial performance for the quarter. Starting with our primary metric of success, adjusted EPS, we delivered very strong results again in Q1, growing earnings by 20% to $2.50 per share. Our revenue in the quarter was also very strong, increasing 23% year-over-year to $5.85 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 20% to $1.29 billion, and our adjusted operating margin in Q1 was 22%. When I think about the quarter at a high level, the overriding message is that our team executed well and took advantage of the opportunities in our markets to deliver an excellent quarter. Now let me give you some color on our performance by end market, starting with pharma and biotech. We delivered just over 10% growth in the quarter, with continued strength across all of our businesses serving this end market. The underlying dynamics here are robust, and we continue to gain share with these customers by delivering our unique value proposition. In academic and government, we grew in the mid-single-digits during the quarter. And in diagnostics and health care, we had low-single-digits growth in Q1. Conditions here were in line with what we've been seeing for some time. Last, in industrial and applied, we delivered high-single-digit growth in the quarter, driven by continued strength in this end market. It was great to see strong performance in Q1 across all of our Analytical Instruments businesses serving this customer base. So to summarize the performance, the good conditions we saw in our end markets at the end of last year continued in Q1, and our team did an excellent job of identifying the opportunities and delivering results. Now I'd like to review some of the highlights from the quarter. And as usual, I'll cover them in the context of our growth strategy. I'm pleased to report that we continued to make great progress in advancing our strategy to meet the needs of our customers and ensure a bright future for our company. As you know, our growth strategy consists of three pillars. The first being our commitment to develop high-impact, innovative new products. We continued to see great traction from new products we've recently released. For example, you recall that one of the significant new products from 2017 was the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Q Exactive HFX mass spectrometer. I'm pleased to say that it's already a strong contributor to growth less than a year after launch. This example points to the success of our innovation strategy and our ability to continuously develop the best-in-class products that our customers expect from Thermo Fisher. In 2018, we'll spend close to $1 billion in R&D, and we started the year strong with a number of product launches in Q1. In Analytical Instruments, we introduced several new Thermo Scientific products that leverage our leading instrument platforms and digital capabilities to help our customers simplify their workflows and better manage data. One of the highlights was our new line of Vanquish Duo UHPLC systems. The Vanquish Duo platform help scientists in biopharma labs maximize sample throughput while ensuring the quality of their results. And we continue to build on our gold standard Chromatography Data System by introducing the Chromeleon XTR, which allows customers to capture and manage their data across the entire laboratory. In Q1, we also launched new products in electron microscopy portfolio, including the Thermo Scientific Verios G4 extreme high-resolution scanning electron microscope for advanced semiconductor production. The electron microscopy business continues to perform very well, and we had another great quarter in Q1. Just after quarter-end, we were very pleased to learn that our Krios G3i Cryo-EM system for structural biology applications received the 2018 Gold Edison Award, which recognizes the world's best innovations. Finally, in our next-gen sequencing business, we introduced the Ion GeneStudio S5 Series of instruments, which features a flexible chip format that allows multiple experiments to be run on a single platform. The GeneStudio is easily integrated with our Ion AmpliSeq, Ion Chef and Ion Torrent bioinformatics to create a seamless workflow that provides greater sequencing flexibility and speed. And when combined with our expanding Oncomine portfolio of liquid biopsy and immuno-oncology assays, this new platform offers a complete solution that help researchers bring new cancer diagnostics to the clinic. The second pillar of our growth strategy is our ability to leverage our scale in emerging and high-growth markets, and we continued to see strength across these geographies in Q1. Another quarter of outstanding performance in China, India and South Korea led to double-digit growth across the Asia Pacific region. I'll cover a couple of the highlights from the quarter. First, in South Korea, our Analytical Instruments were used by the Korean (sic) [Korea] Institute of Science and Technology's Doping Control Center to identify banned substances in athletes during the major world sports event that took place there this winter. We also provided on-site technical and application support to our Unity Lab Services capability. Another major event for us in the region during Q1 was the first China-U.S. Precision Medicine Summit, which was held in Beijing in late March. Thermo Fisher played the leading role in creating the summit in partnership with the CEO Roundtable on Cancer, the China Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College. Our collective goal was to bring together thought leaders from government, academia and industry to accelerate precision medicine advancements and continue to increase the impact on patient care. You may recall that Thermo Fisher established a Precision Medicine Science Center in Guangzhou last year. We remain focused on leveraging our industry leadership to advance this key initiative, not only in China, but for our customers and their patients around the world. Now, I'll turn to the last element of our growth strategy, our unique customer value proposition. Probably the best example of the power it brings is in the pharma and biotech end market, where our customers are focused on both increasing productivity and accelerating their pace of innovation to keep their pipelines full. As you know, we've continued to strengthen our offering for these customers and our acquisition of Patheon last year was the most significant recent example. I'm pleased to let you know that the Patheon integration continues to go very well and the team has done a great job right out of the gate. Our PPI Business System is already widely utilized. We're achieving our cost-synergy target and the team is making great progress in driving the revenue synergy opportunities as a result of our combined capabilities. But even more important is the feedback we're hearing from our customers, both large and small pharma and biotech companies see the value we can provide. For example, large customers are taking advantage of our ability to help them optimize their manufacturing networks, drive productivity and simplify their supply chains. And small and emerging customers are looking for us for the technical expertise and know-how to develop and produce complex drugs. Thermo Fisher is in a unique position to address these and other challenges with the most comprehensive solution in the industry. I've recently met with the manufacturing leaders of a number of our pharma and biotech customers. They clearly see the benefits we can bring by leveraging our capabilities across the company to support their goals from research through commercial production. And we continue to make our value proposition even stronger for these customers. We've recently announced that we're investing in a new best-in-class supply chain facility in Europe near Baden, Germany and we're expanding our U.S. biologics manufacturing center in St. Louis. Before I cover our revised guidance, I'll make a quick update on our capital deployment. In the quarter, we acquired IntegenX, a small acquisition that nicely complements our technologies used for human identification by adding a rapid DNA platform. It's a great addition to our genetic sciences offering. Turning to our guidance. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. The increase is based primarily on our strong operational performance in Q1, both organically and from the Patheon acquisition. It also factors in the more favorable foreign exchange environment that we saw in Q1. So the headlines are : that we're raising our revenue guidance to a new range of $23.62 billion to $23.86 billion in 2018. This would result in 13% to 14% growth over 2017. In terms of our adjusted EPS guidance, we now expect to deliver between $10.80 and $10.96 per share. This would lead to 14% to 15% growth over the strong adjusted EPS performance we delivered this past year. So to summarize our key takeaways from Q1, we're pleased to start the year strong, and our teams did a great job of capitalizing on the good market conditions. We're also making terrific progress with our growth initiatives and clearly gaining market share. Our excellent results in Q1 really sets us up to achieve another successful year ahead. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everybody. I'll take you through an overview of our first quarter results for the total company. And then, I'll provide some color on our four business segments and wrap up with our updated 2018 guidance. Before I get into the details, let me start with a high-level view of how the first quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered a very strong quarter with 7% organic growth, which is about 2 points ahead of our expectations. This is driven by strong operational execution taking advantage of good market conditions. We were also able to deliver $0.10 more adjusted earnings per share in Q1 than we'd assumed in the midpoint of our previous guidance. $0.07 from operational performance, driven by the incremental organic growth as well as strong contributions from our pharma services business, the former Patheon, and $0.03 from more favorable FX versus our initial guidance. So we're off to a great start to the year. Now let me give you more color on the quarter. Starting with our total company financial performance for Q1. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 20% to $2.50. GAAP EPS was $1.43, up 2% from Q1 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 23% year-over-year. The components of our Q1 reported revenue included 7% organic growth, 12% growth from acquisitions and a 4% benefit from foreign exchange. Looking at growth by geography in Q1. North America grew low single-digits, while Europe grew in the mid-single digits. And Asia Pacific grew in the mid-teens, including another quarter of high-teens growth in China. And rest of the world grew in the mid-single digits. Turning to our operational performance. Q1 adjusted operating income increased 20% and adjusted operating margin was 22%, down 50 basis points from Q1 of last year. As a reminder, Patheon is a scale acquisition with gross margins and operating income margins lower than the company average. The effect was approximately 110 basis points dilutive to total adjusted operating margins in the quarter. The addition of Patheon will continue to be dilutive to our adjusted operating margins over the first 12 months of ownership through late August. Foreign exchange did not have a material impact on operating margins during the quarter. So our underlying operational performance was strong in the quarter at 60 basis points of expansion, driven by productivity, volume leverage, partially offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 46.3% in Q1, down 300 basis points from the prior year. Strong productivity was more than offset by the expected significant dilutive impact of acquisitions and to a lesser extent, unfavorable business mix. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 20.4% of revenue, which is down 190 basis points versus Q1 2017, and total R&D expense came in at 4% of revenue, down 50 basis points versus Q1 last year. Both were primarily due to acquisitions. And R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q1 was 6.7%. Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense was $143 million, up $26 million from Q1 last year, mainly as a result of the incremental debt related to our capital deployment activities in 2017. Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense in the quarter of $1 million. As a reminder, as of January 1, 2018, we adopted the new pension accounting standard and have restated prior years. The impact versus our prior guidance is an increase in operating costs of approximately $3 million per quarter and an offsetting increase in other income. There is no net impact to adjusted EPS. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 11.4%, down 260 basis points versus last year due to the impact of U.S. tax reform, the addition of Patheon as well as the timing of discrete tax planning items. This was in line with our guidance, and we still expect the full year tax rate to be 12%. Q1 average diluted shares were 406 million, up 12 million year-over-year. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations through Q1 was $80 million, and free cash flow was negative $40 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $120 million, and this is in line with our full year guidance. We ended the quarter with $950 million in cash and investments. As for capital deployment activities in Q1, as Marc mentioned, we closed the acquisition of IntegenX, and we also returned $60 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $20.9 billion, down $75 million sequentially from Q4, and our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.8 times total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA. And wrapping up my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 10.1%, up 10 basis points from last quarter and in line with our expectations. So now I'll provide you some color on the performance of our four business segments. Starting with Life Sciences Solutions Segment. Reported revenue increased 10% in Q1 and organic revenue grew 5%. In the quarter, we saw strong growth in our bioproduction, next-generation sequencing and biosciences businesses. Q1 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 19%, and adjusted operating margin was 34.5%, up 270 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong productivity, had good volume pull-through and saw favorable FX. This was partially offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. In the Analytical Instruments Segment, reported revenue increased 19% in Q1 and organic revenue growth was 13%. In the quarter, we benefited from strong growth contributions across all of our businesses in this segment : electron microscopy, chroma/mass spec and chemical analysis. Q1 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments grew 28% and adjusted operating margin was 19.6%, up 140 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw very strong volume leverage and productivity partially offset by strategic investments and the expected dilutive impact of FX. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics Segment, in Q1 total revenue grew 9% and organic revenue growth was 5%. We saw particularly strong growth in our health care market channel. Adjusted operating income increased 4% in Q1 and adjusted operating margin was 25.6%, down 130 basis points from Q1 of the prior year. In the quarter, we drove strong productivity, but this is more than offset by product mix and strategic investments. And finally, in the Laboratory Products and Services Segment, which includes the Patheon acquisition, Q1 reported revenue increased 42%. Organic revenue growth was 6%. In the quarter, we saw a strong growth in both our clinical trials logistics business and in our research channel. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 30% and adjusted operating margin was 11.6%, down 110 basis points from the prior year. In the quarter, we saw very strong volume leverage and productivity, but this was more than offset by product mix and strategic investments. So I'll now move on to our updated full year 2018 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance. And let me walk you through the details. First, revenue. Given the strong start to the year we're raising the midpoint of our guidance by $170 million and tightening the range by $60 million. The $170 million increase to the midpoint consists of three elements : first, a $50 million increase in our organic growth outlook for the year, so we now expect full year 2018 organic growth of about 5%. Second, a $60 million increase from acquisitions, primarily reflecting the strong start to the year by Patheon, but it also includes the impact of adding IntegenX. And third, a $60 million increase in revenue to reflect a more significant benefit from FX in Q1 versus our initial guidance. Turning to adjusted earnings per share, we're increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10. This comprises $0.05 from strong Q1 operational performance, $0.07 from both favorable FX environment and $0.02 of dilution for the acquisition of IntegenX. To sum this up, the increased 2018 revenue guidance is now a range of $23.62 billion to $23.86 billion and this will represent 13% to 14% growth versus 2017. We expect acquisitions to contribute just over 7% to our reported revenue growth in 2018, and FX is expected to be a benefit of just under 2%. And our updated adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2018 is now a range of $10.80 to $10.96, with a midpoint of $10.88. This represents growth of 14% to 15% versus 2017. A few other details behind the revised 2018 guidance. We're now assuming that foreign exchange is a $360 million revenue tailwind for the year or just under 2%. The FX tailwind on adjusted EPS is now assumed to be $0.20 or just over 2%. Given the ongoing volatility in FX rates, we've continued to take a conservative approach to FX guidance versus current spot rates. In terms of adjusted operating margins, we continue to expect to deliver 20 to 30 basis points of expansion for the year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, this represents 70 to 80 basis points of expansion. We continue to expect net interest expense to be in the range of $550 million to $555 million, and we're now assuming other income and expense to be a net income of just under $10 million versus our previous forecast of an immaterial net expense. As I mentioned earlier, this is largely driven by the adoption of the new pension accounting rules. From an EPS standpoint, there's no net impact versus our prior guidance, it's just a switch in P&L categories. We continue to expect an adjusted income tax rate of 12% for the year. Due to the timing of discrete planning items, the rate was slightly lower than this in Q1 and will be slightly higher for the remaining quarters of the year. But for the year as a whole, we still expect the tax rate to be 12%. In terms of capital deployments, my model continues to assume $500 million of share buybacks in the second half of 2018. We also continue to assume we'll return approximately $275 million of capital to shareholders through dividends. Our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures. We're assuming net capital expenditures will be approximately $700 million to $730 million. No change from previous guidance. And for free cash flow, we're expecting about $3.8 billion for the full year, consistent with previous guidance. We continue to expect full year average diluted shares to be in the range of 405 million to 407 million. And finally, a couple of comments on phasing for the rest of the year. We expect organic growth in Q2 and Q3 to be about the company full year level. And as a reminder, we have very strong comps in Q4. But in terms of adjusted EPS phasing, we continue to expect the same phasing as 2017 when you look at each quarter of the year as a percentage of the full year. In summary, we started the year with an excellent Q1, and we're in a great position to achieve our goals for the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to open it up for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning, guys, and congrats. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thank you, Ross. Good morning. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : So maybe, could we start on sort of China? The outperformance there continues, I mean it's quite remarkable given the size and scope of the enterprise to be up high teens. Can you give us a little color kind of underlying what the mix is there in terms of semi versus industrial versus pharma? Because it seems like you're getting pretty broad strength in that market, and the pharma market in particular seems to be kind of notable standout, at least versus where maybe some of us were thinking comparative to the cyclical parts. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Ross, thanks for the question. So China is an area that we have had a very good track record for a long period of time, and we've been delivering high teens growth, 2016, 2017 and into the first quarter of 2018. The outlook continues to be very strong. In terms of where it's coming from, the health care, pharma, biotech has been quite robust. Academic spend has been good, and industrial spend certainly has improved as we've seen out geographically as well, improvements in industrial and applied. So it's really broad-based, not driven by any one particular area. It was really exciting that we orchestrated the first ever China-U.S. Precision Medicine Conference. We had 400 participants there, and co-hosted that with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the CEO Roundtable on Cancer, so really, very strong. The outlook looks good. One of the questions that I've been asked in other venues is, how is the headlines in the papers affecting China customer sentiment? And no effect. Very robust outlook. Mark Stevenson, our COO, was there a couple of weeks ago. I'm heading off to China on Sunday. And the team is really excited. It's very, very positive market for us. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks, Marc. And just maybe sticking on pharma for a second, it seems like Patheon notably kind of exceeded what most of us were looking for and that business has kind of improved last couple of quarters after having a fairly mixed go of it prior to the acquisition. Can you give us a little underlying color of what you're seeing in some of those key segments for Patheon? How those conversations are going at the pharma level in terms of incremental business development, and then talk about the recent facility expansion you highlighted? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Sure. So, in terms of our pharma services business, it's off to a good start. The Patheon acquisition integration is going very well. When I think about the performance, as Stephen noted, we're ahead of where we thought we were going to be in Q1, and part of our revenue and earnings increase for the guidance for the balance of the year or for the full year is based on Patheon's strong performance. So that's very encouraging. I've had the chance to meet with quite a number of customers in the first four months of the year and bringing colleagues from the former Patheon business with me to meet some of the colleagues and open up new doors. Really, it's a very, very encouraging feedback. As you know, it's a long-cycle business. It takes a while to go through decision, tech transfer, but the pipeline of activity has been fantastic, right? So not only is the business doing well short-term, but the outlook, we continue to be very, very bullish on. So, great start, lots of work to do, and we're looking forward to it. We had two expansions that we announced in the quarter, one in our clinical trials business, which we actually made the facility a bit larger to also incorporate some of Patheon's capabilities. And that's a world-class supply chain set of capabilities for clinical materials in Europe and really allows us to serve the growing business there. And secondly, we announced earlier this week the expansion of our St. Louis biologics facility, part of our 4-factory network for biologics production. This is something that Patheon had been evaluating and presented to us during the diligence process. So it was something that was very well thought through. We wanted to just understand it in more detail post ownership and feel great about it. So that's an expansion that will meaningfully increase our single-use technology capabilities in St. Louis for our biotech and pharmaceutical customers. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thank you so much, Marc. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Ross. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Derik. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, a couple of questions. We've been getting a bunch of incomings from people asking a little bit more color on FEI. I think there's some concern about some of the \u2013 the numbers coming out of some of the semiconductor customers and people are just sort of worrying about sort of the trends in the business. If I remember correctly, when you guys acquired FEI, about 35% of the business was semi capped at the time. Sorry. Could you refresh me? And sort of like reflection was sort of like the growth rates have been in that business and sort of like your outlook for it? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes. So, Derik, thanks for the question. Our electron microscopy business continues the trend of very strong performance. We saw that strong performance in materials science applications. That's both semiconductor and all other applications, things like batteries for automotive, things like advanced materials research, as well as strong growth and momentum in our life sciences or structural biology applications. The business grew well above the company average as did all of our Analytical Instruments businesses. So when you look at the Analytical Instruments Segment, it wasn't really electron microscopy-driven, but actually it was strength across chroma/mass spec, chemical analysis and electron microscopy. When you look at the performance of FEI, synergies are on track. Integration is pretty much done. And when I think about the outlook there, bookings continue to be strong. So, we feel very good about it. And in terms of kind of the materiality, FEI, if we didn't have FEI as part of our numbers, we would have grown 6% in the quarter. So the company had a great quarter. Electron microscopy had a great quarter from a top line. So, hopefully, that kind of answers the various perspectives on electron microscopy. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, that's a lot more color than I expected. So thanks, appreciate that. And then just I'm going to squeeze in two, because I've just been getting these and they're sort of related to each other. I've got a bunch of questions on just the sort of like as we see sort of changes in interest rates, sort of how your current balance sheet is set up? And if there's any issues in terms of needing to re-financing and sort of fixed and floating rates and, I guess, sort of how this is \u2013 how sort of like the changing environments impacts your capital deployment strategy in terms of \u2013 does it change up with your M&A targets or metrics? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So in terms of the M&A portion, we've used the same weighted average cost of capital since I joined the company, as is Stephen in 2001, which is a hurdle rate of 8.5%. So, in terms of the interest rate movements or potential movements, we've been using the cost of capital assumption that's been greater than what our true cost of capital is. So there's no effect there. And obviously, when we're deploying capital, we're looking for double-digit returns. In terms of what we've assumed in our model, we've assumed the Fed to increase rates 25 basis points each of the quarters. So that's assumed in the interest cost. I don't know Stephen, if you want to make... Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes, I'd add some additional color. Derik, when we think about the long-term model that I talked about at the last analyst meeting, basically that assumes an increase in rates going forward. So I don't see that unless rates spike very fast, but I think we're basically modeling that out in terms of the company's performance going forward. We've got just over $5 billion of debt that's variable rate right now. In terms of the maturities, we're making sure we've got a good ladder in terms of maturities so we can manage the debt appropriately. And about half of that variable rate debt actually is outside of the U.S. in euros. So I think we're managing it appropriately. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. Marc, I want to follow up on your comment a minute ago about Analytical Instruments because you're showing accelerating growth here against comps that have gotten a little bit more difficult. And obviously, FEI has been a big part of that. But as you mentioned, the overall Analytical portfolio is doing better. How much do you think is just the market doing a little bit better versus maybe share gains versus maybe you being exposed to some faster growth segments? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes. So, Tycho, you've covered the company a long time, and to see all three of our instrument lines do well, the chemical analysis piece is really driven by market, right? So that's encouraging in terms of the acceleration. The chroma/mass spec, clearly, is share gain. The business is doing very well and very strong growth. So that one is straightforward. The market is good, actually. When I look at it geographically, the chroma/mass spec business, it was good in China, it was good in India, it was good in the U.S. So that business is performing very well. But market, chemical analysis, probably good market in chroma/mass spec with strong share gain as well. And as I mentioned earlier, electron microscopy, we have a good position there, and our business is performing well across the three applications of the two materials science ones and life sciences. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then a follow-up on Patheon. We had a couple of people asking with the news this week, the additional capacity expansion. Are you able to say how much of that is committed at this point? Or how do we think about utilization ramping as that comes online? And then at the time of the Patheon deal, you had also talked about the opportunity set being pretty wide for bolt-ons around that. So I'm just curious as to how actively you're looking at complementing what you had there with M&A? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes. So, Tycho, thanks for the question. Because it's single-use technology expansion, what we're doing is really expanding the shell of the building, but you add the physical capacity of the reactors as you get customer commitments, so that you don't wind up. It's not a big stainless steel facility where you start with very low utilization after ramp. It's rather you kind of add as you go. So we feel good about what the revenue outlook is and it kind of lines up with the expansion of capacity during 2019 and beyond. In terms of the pipeline, we have a very active M&A pipeline across our various businesses, including our pharma services business. And we'll continue to evaluate the various transactions. And if they're good fits with good returns, then we'll do that. But, as you know, we continue to be a very disciplined acquirer. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just one quick clarification. Was there any flu contribution in Specialty Diagnostics? I had a few people asking about that. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes. So in terms of flu, we saw stronger growth in our health care market channel, which benefited from the stronger flu season in the U.S. At the company level, flu was negligible in terms of the impact. When you look at the Specialty Diagnostics business, there was a little bit of an offset to the strong flu which was the first quarter was a particularly weak seasonal allergy season. So you got benefit of flu which is lower margin and a little bit of softness in seasonal allergy which is higher margin. So that probably \u2013 as you kind of work your way through numbers, that helps reconcile things. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. So thanks for all the Patheon updates. At the clinical trial logistics business, so strong growth in the quarter. How are booking trends there and what new outsourcing opportunities are you seeing with the integrated offering? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So the clinical trials business had a nice start to the year and a good outlook for the full year. So that business has returned to robust growth which is in line with what we thought it would do. So that's good to see. The feedback from the customer base in terms of the combined offering of both formulation and the packaging logistics and manufacturing capabilities we have has really been very positive. That's actually been the area where we've gotten our first revenue synergies already in the book. And the reason you would do that or get that faster is at shorter decision-making time, right. You're dealing with clinical materials versus commercial products. So we're starting to see the synergies there, and we're making the offering as integrated and as seamless as possible for the customer base which will be very positive over time. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And then geographically could you give a little bit more color on the U.S. market? I think I heard low single digits. Just how the various businesses are performing domestically? Thanks. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes. So, Jack, North America very similar to what we've been seeing, low single-digit growth in the quarter. And nothing really jumped out as a particularly different trend than what we've seen in the last year. So we've been able to deliver the very strong organic growth for the quarter with that low to mid-single-digit-type growth that we've been seeing in North America, and that's what our expectation is. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you, Marc. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. I just want to go back to free cash flow. It was negative in the quarter. This seems largely attributable to the increase in working capital in the quarter. It was a figure that was light of our forecast. And while you indicated that free cash flow was in line with your expectation, you would need to ramp Q2 through Q4 free cash flow at a steeper rate than we've typically seen you generate and that's to get to your reiterated full year free cash flow target of $3.8 billion for the year. So with that in mind, just a few questions. One, why was Q1 free cash flow negative? Is this just typical Q1 timing? Second, how is Patheon impacting free cash flow? And what's the long-term target there? Third, what gives you confidence in your ability to ramp the way your guidance implies over the balance of the year? And fourth, you materially beat revenue and EPS expectations for the quarter. You increased guidance for the year, but you didn't change your free cash flow outlook. I'm wondering why. Thank you. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Okay. So thanks for the four-part question. So when you think about the negative cash flow in Q1, as you can see from the cash flow statement, it's really driven by working capital. A piece of this is in Q4. We had a very strong contribution from working capital, and that was slightly higher than we had anticipated in \u2013 as we were entering Q4. So we've seen a little bit of that unwind as we've gone into Q1. And that's really then offset by the strength and the outlook in terms of overall for the earnings for the year. So that's why we still feel very confident about the $3.8 billion for the full year. And when you look on the history of our cash flows, they're very much \u2013 they're favoring towards the end of the year, Q2 and Q3, in particular. So, yes, there's nothing really to read into this. It's really just around the change in the working capital, little bit on cash taxes and cash interest. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: And the Patheon impact? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes, the Patheon is basically as we'd expected. So we previously \u2013 before Patheon expecting to deliver about 90% of adjusted net income into free cash flow. Patheon has slightly had very capital intensity of a business and the overall of that brings the company average to 88%. And that's kind of what we guided to for the year. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And real quick, just to sneak in one more. On NIH, how is activity and demand from U.S. academic, government, research customers trended subsequent to the new fiscal 2018 NIH budget release? And does the NIH budget change impact your growth expectations for the end market as you've incorporated assumptions into guidance? Thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Doug, thanks. In terms of NIH, if you go back to our guidance at the end of January, our assumption in the guidance was that we would get a budget at some point in the early part of the year and that that budget would increase. So the $3 billion increase that we saw in March was in line with what we're expecting to happen. Obviously, it happened late in the quarter, so it really had no effect on what we saw in the North America spend in the market. And generally, when you look at academic and government, the North America was modest growth in the quarter and good strength in Europe and good strength in China. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for the time here. Just a couple of clarifications on channel dynamics. I guess, first, I'd start with diagnostics. If I take the results in Specialty Diagnostics, certainly a good number, actually a little ahead of us, little bit of help from flu. But then if I look at the results on the diagnostics and health care channel, maybe a little lighter than we expected. I wonder \u2013 I appreciate that you called out that it was in line with internal plan. Can you just help us parse through the deltas there on the trends so we can maybe piece the model together a little bit more finely? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes. So, Steve, I'll take that one. So when you think about Specialty Diagnostics growing 5% and diagnostics and health care are growing low-single digits. In terms of like gap, in terms of the diagnostics products we have good traction with some applied end markets particularly around food safety and that shows up in industrial and applied. And then outside the Specialty Diagnostics, you see the impact of timing of some large orders in some businesses there. And the combination of those two things create that dynamic, slightly different growth rates. When you look at the actual, we give low single-digit ranges and specific numbers for the segments. It's not that materially different between the two. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. And then one for Marc on bioprocess. It's been a long time since I've seen such a big spread between revenue growth in bioprocess and order growth in bioprocess. And to be fair, of course, there is comment on what we're seeing outside of Thermo as we don't see your numbers. But if we roll the numbers up, it looks like strong order growth against revenue growth that's still maybe mid-single digits. Is that a reasonable way to think about the market? It still hasn't really popped back in a strong way, but really strong lead indicators. We just love to hear any observations you have on how things are evolving there. Thanks. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes. I mean if I think about the quarter for pharma and biotech, first starting at the one level above your question, which is, it's a great quarter, right, 10% growth. And when you look at it, we saw strength across our entire business and we saw really strong performance in bioproduction, chroma/mass spec and in our channel business. And then, when you look at the bioproduction piece, it was a great quarter, right, with very strong growth. So I'm not sure about this bookings mid-single-digits, it's not reflective at all of our performance in the market. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Well, love to see the share gains. Thanks, Marc. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Good morning. A couple of quick questions for you guys. First, if you could just remind us on your exposure to India and generics? And any comments related to that end market? And then I had one follow-up. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Well, what's the follow-up? What's the second one? Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: The second one is just it sounds like the guidance increase for organic growth here for the full year seems to be largely due to the outperformance here in the first quarter. I'm just wondering why you don't think or at least not factoring in here kind of that stronger trends continuing or being sustainable over the remainder of the year? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Sure. Good question. So India is less than 2% of our revenue, double-digit growth, been on that trend for a long period of time. So it's really \u2013 there's not much more in India other than the business is doing well. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: And not a concentration in generic manufacturing customers. So... Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: No, we cover the full market, including that customer base. From an organic perspective, obviously, very strong start to the year. We were pleased to raise our guidance from 4% to 5% to about 5%. And we raised the guidance by $50 million organically. We obviously also raised it for the strong \u2013 on top of that for the Patheon performance as well, which doesn't show up in the organic calculations. When we think about the balance of the year and why we did that level, I felt like the right thing to \u2013 from a prudent standpoint to do, but with one quarter behind us, that perspective. If the market conditions continue to play out like we saw in Q1, this is going to be a very, very strong year. So we're going to maximize our share gain and capitalize on all the opportunities and play it out that way. Just as a reminder, we have a challenging comparison in the fourth quarter with the 8% growth last year in the fourth quarter. So the strong start to the year gives us a little bit of buffer for a range of outcomes on the fourth quarter, but everything we see right now is quite positive. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. Marc, maybe just on the industrial/applied markets, can you talk through the core industrial growth rates in various geographies? Wondering specifically on how the U.S. and China trended in that market. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes. Patrick, thanks for the question. So industrial and applied markets is very strong with high single-digit growth. Really, saw it strongly in our instrument business. The chroma/mass spec, chemical analysis, which is a lot of your spectroscopy-type instruments, electron microscopy for the materials science applications. Asia was really the stand-out. It was not at all limited to China, but China was strong. Japan actually had a good quarter. We saw it in Korea. So, Taiwan was good. So, really, broad-based across Asia Pacific and reasonable market conditions in Europe and in North America. But really, the strength was driven by broad-based strength in Asia Pacific. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then maybe now some of the hurricane disruptions are farther on the rearview here, can you update us just on Patheon cost synergies? How utilization is trending in some of the facilities? I know that's where the synergies are going to come from. So I'm curious on how that's trending. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes. So in terms of the cost synergies, we're running right on track from the cost synergies and the funnel on the revenue synergies looks very encouraging, which should really be very helpful to the 2019 numbers as we build that. But those are running on track from that perspective. From the hurricane impact, I did go down and visit our sites in Puerto Rico in March. And really, the team there has done a remarkable job. We got back up into production in January, so no impact financially in terms of this year. But actually, the team across our sites there actually took the adversity of a tough situation and actually made the business stronger. Really, I was very impressed, and came away inspired by what the teams are doing. So we're off to a good start in Patheon, not only in Puerto Rico but across the board. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Patrick, just some additional color. So we're rolling out the PPI Business System across the Patheon sites. That's essentially being completed in terms of the first seven key sites and rolling out to the rest. And it's been really well embraced by the team. And it's going to be a big driver long-term of the cost synergies and the capacity utilization. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: And we said we were running slightly ahead of the $0.30 accretion that we expected for the first full year. So, things are going well there, Patrick. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Appreciate it. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. So, on the LPS segment, I was hoping you can give some more color on the margin declines. Stephen, I think you mentioned mix and some strategic investments, but anymore color you could offer would be helpful. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes. So in terms of LPS, in terms of the mix dynamic, it was primarily due to the channel business, which is lower-margin than the rest of the businesses in that segment growing faster than the Lab Products business, which is a higher-margin business in that segment. So that was really the mix dynamic. And then investment-wise, we continue to invest in the capabilities here, serving key end markets. And we continue to invest in the service and e-business capabilities, e-commerce capabilities within the channel business. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is open. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thanks. Marc, just another one on industrial. Obviously, the things there have come back nicely. So, I guess, when you talk to customers, does it feel like there's a potential for sort of a natural pause once you get past this initial wave of pent-up spending? Or do you think, for the most part, order trends are pretty smoothly upward for a while? Just trying to get a sense for the second or third inning of what the rebound might look like. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: That's a hard one to know. In bookings, we're good, right? So which gives you some revenue visibility going forward and obviously the teams have a very active funnel of potential new orders. But that's going to be driven by ultimately if they converge it's just going to be a function of macroeconomic outlook, geopolitical, things of that sort. But right now, very encouraging in terms of what we're seeing. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then, Stephen, to your point in the prepared remarks, LSS margins have been kind of creeping up pretty steadily here. Is mid-30s the right way to model that segment these days before just thinking about mid-single-digit organic? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes. I think we get very good volume leverage off that business. So we got good margin expansion potential for that going forward. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, got it. Thank you. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Dan. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Operator, we have time for just one more. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hey, guys. Congratulations on the quarter. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Paul. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : As you look at the past cycles on PMI, what are you think Marc where we are? You think first three months of this or a year or what's your thoughts? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes. In terms of the discussion with the industrial customer base, it's been very positive. We went through a long period of very difficult conditions in the industrial base. So you're benefiting from two different factors : a) older fleet out there, so customers are wanting to get the benefit of a new fleet of instruments as well as capacity expansion. And we actually \u2013 we got our first big new expansion in the mining portion of our business. It's a very small portion of our business, but that's very encouraging, right? Because those are multiyear projects and based on the forecast of the economic growth, it's going to be good. So, at least right now we feel like the outlook continues to be very positive in the industrial end markets. Thank you for the question, Paul. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Marc, with the media business, isn't that going to help op margins at Thermo with media integrated with Catalent. Could you talk to that? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes. So in terms of our media capabilities, it should be \u2013 one of the things I've been super excited about is the collaboration between our bioproduction team which would be media and our biologics team, which would be Patheon and the knowledge sharing and the learning that we're getting. So, over time, that clearly is going to improve the margins for our contract manufacturing activities as well as raise our expectations and performance for bioproduction. So feel very good about it. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Let me wrap-up the call. Obviously, we're pleased to deliver another very strong quarter. We feel we're in a very strong position to deliver on our growth goals for the year. As always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. And we're looking forward to seeing you at our Investor Day in New York City on May 23, which you know I always consider as my favorite day of the year. Look forward to seeing all of you. Thanks.

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thank you Ken. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our Q2 call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered another terrific quarter. We achieved excellent growth in revenue and earnings. Our team executed well to capitalize on the continued strength of our end markets. We also continued to make great progress in advancing our growth strategy by launching new products that address key customer needs leveraging scale in emerging markets and delivering our unique customer value proposition. As a result we continue to both strengthen and capitalize on our competitive position. With an excellent first half behind us, we're in a great position to achieve another very successful year. I'll cover the highlights for the quarter starting with an overview of our financial results. Our adjusted earnings per share grew 20% to $2.75 per share in Q2. Our revenue in the quarter was also very strong increasing 22% year-over-year to $6.08 billion. And adjusted operating income increased 21% to $1.4 billion. And our adjusted operating margin in Q2 was 23.1%. While we're clearly benefiting from favorable end market dynamics, our performance is primarily the result of our commitment to a proven growth strategy well executed over a long period of time and that has now put us in a unique competitive position and allowed us to continue our share gain momentum. Now let me give you a little color on the performance by end market. In Q2, we saw strength in all of our end markets whether you slice it by customer set or geography. Starting with pharma and biotech, we delivered mid-teens growth in the quarter with ongoing strength across our businesses serving this end market. Conditions here have remained robust and we continue to gain share with these customers by delivering our unique value proposition to help them drive innovation and productivity. In diagnostics and healthcare, we grew in the mid-single digits in Q2 with broad-based strength across our businesses serving this end market. Turning to industrial and applied, we delivered mid-single digit growth in the quarter, highlighted by continued strong customer demand in our analytical instrument businesses. Last, in academic and government, we grew in the high-single-digits in Q2. We did well in this end market in all geographies and it was good to see an increase in the flow of funds in the U.S. Let me make a quick comment on our overall performance from a geographic perspective. We saw good conditions in our end markets across the globe and we continued our strong momentum in China with better than 20% growth in the quarter. So the strength of our global competitive position coupled with strong market conditions and great execution by our team led to excellent growth during Q2. Now, let me make some remarks on our business highlights in the context of our growth strategy. As you know, one element of our strategy is developing high impact innovative new products. Our ongoing success here is a result of the deep insights we gain from our customers. We collaborate closely to ensure that we're putting our industry-leading R&D investment to work in a way that creates the most value for them. We had a number of great examples in Q2 for customers working in research, applied markets and the clinic and I'll cover a few of them this morning. First, at the American Society of (sic) [for] Mass Spectrometry Conference in June we had a number of launches including two new instruments that expand our leading Orbitrap platform. The Thermo Scientific Q Exactive UHMR Hybrid Quadruple system creates an integrated workflow to streamline protein analysis in structural biology applications. And the Thermo Scientific ID-X Tribrid system combines our leading technologies to improve small molecule characterization in applications ranging from drug discovery to food safety. In our next-gen sequencing business, we developed a new Oncomine panel in collaboration with Children's Hospital in Los Angeles. This assay specifically identifies mutations that indicate cancers in pediatric and young adult patients. And in Specialty Diagnostics, we launched the Thermo Scientific B.R.A.H.M.S. KRYPTOR GOLD instrument in Europe. This is an automated immunoassay analyzer that helps customers process blood samples much faster increasing lab productivity while providing the assay quality that KRYPTOR is known for. One last comment on innovation is that we opened a Precision Medicine Science Center here in the U.S. during the quarter. The center will give customers access to the comprehensive range of technologies we offer to help them advance their work in genomic, proteomic and metabolomic analysis. It complements the Precision Medicine Center we opened last year in China and promotes the global collaboration necessary to make real progress in individualized patient care. The second element of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in emerging and high growth markets. As I mentioned earlier, we saw continued strength across these geographies in Q2. The highlight was China where we delivered another outstanding quarter. Our strategy of leveraging our unmatched scale and depth of capabilities along with great tactical execution is enabling us to take full advantage of the many growth opportunities we have. This sets us up very well to help our customers in China meet the objectives outlined in the country's five year plan. Precision medicine is one of those key priorities in the plan and you may recall that earlier this year we organized a scientific summit in Beijing with global thought leaders from government, academia and healthcare. One of the outcomes is that we're now providing a range of our Analytical Technologies, to help build an infrastructure in China for multi-omics applications in support of precision medicine. This is another great example of the advantages we have because of our industry-leading scale and depth. Our long-term focus on expanding our presence in the region has clearly created a competitive advantage for us and we feel very good about our prospects. Now, I'll turn to the last element of our growth strategy, which is our unique customer value proposition. The key point I want to make here is that we're always making it stronger both organically and through complementary M&A. This allows us to deepen our customer relationships and drive share gain. Let me give you a couple examples of how we executed our M&A strategy to create more value for our customers and strengthen the position of our businesses to drive growth. First, you know about the addition of our electron microscopy business through the acquisition of FEI a couple of years ago. Since then, the business has performed extremely well as part of our company. We recently announced our agreement to acquire Gatan, a leading manufacturer of filters, cameras and software for electron microscopes. Adding these capabilities will allow us to improve performance of these systems to help electron microscopy customers accelerate their discoveries. We expect to complete the transaction by the end of 2018. Another great example of enhancing our customer value proposition is our biosciences business. I haven't talked about this business in a while, and to remind you, this is the industry leading life science reagent and consumables offering that we created through a combination with Life Technologies in 2014. At that time, the business was growing in the low-single-digits. We had a clear strategy on how to accelerate the growth and we've seen the fruits of that strategy. Today, the business is growing in the high-single-digits. We expanded customer access by leveraging our scale in emerging markets, our Fisher Scientific channel, and the strong customer relationships we've established through our corporate accounts program. We implemented our PPI Business System to drive operational excellence and significantly expand our margins while creating additional capacity to accelerate our investments in R&D to further strengthen our portfolio. We launched a number of successful new products like the Attune Flow Cytometer that we've highlighted in the past. We also made investments in new web and digital capabilities helping to further differentiate our strong Invitrogen premier brand. Both the electron microscopy and biosciences examples reinforce our commitment to enhancing value for our customers by adding new capabilities and then leveraging our scale and depth to continually make the business stronger. To give you a quick update on the Patheon acquisition we're excited about our growth prospects for this business. The integration is going very smoothly and the business is performing well with another quarter of very strong growth in Q2. From a synergy perspective, we're running slightly ahead on our year one synergy targets as well. We're already seeing strong development of the revenue synergy pipeline and believe this will have a meaningful impact on growth over the long-term. Before I cover our revised guidance, I'll give you an update on capital deployment. As a reminder, we outlined our objectives at the beginning of the year, which were a combination of delevering from the Patheon acquisition, maintaining an active M&A pipeline, and returning capital to our shareholders. So far this year we've made great progress in delevering and Stephen will give you the details. From an M&A perspective, we've committed $1 billion through strategic bolt-ons including the pending acquisition of Gatan for $925 million and we've also returned $390 million of capital through dividends and stock buybacks including $250 million worth of shares that we repurchased in July. So we continue to successfully execute our capital deployment strategy to create value for our customers and shareholders. Turning to our guidance. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. The increase is based primarily on our strong operational performance, partially offset by a less favorable foreign exchange environment. We're raising our revenue guidance to a new range of $23.68 billion to $23.86 billion for 2018. This would result in 13% to 14% growth over 2017. In terms of our adjusted EPS guidance, we now expect to deliver between $10.89 and $11.01 per share. This will lead to 15% to 16% growth over the strong adjusted EPS performance we delivered in 2017. So to summarize our key takeaways from Q2, our teams continue to do an outstanding job of executing our growth strategy to strengthen our competitive position. And our excellent results in the first half of 2018 sets us up to achieve another very successful year. With that I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Marc and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our second quarter results for the total company, provide some color on our four business segments, then conclude with our updated 2018 guidance. I'll start with a high level framing of our Q2 performance versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. You saw in the press release we had a very strong quarter with 8% organic growth and 20% adjusted EPS growth. This was driven by great operational execution and continued strong market conditions. We delivered $0.14 more adjusted earnings per share in Q2 than we'd assumed at the midpoint of our previous guidance. Of that $0.11 was driven by stronger organic growth, $0.01 by continued strong contributions from the Patheon acquisition, and $0.02 from more favorable below the line FX in the quarter. So another excellent quarter. Let me give you more details on how Q2 played out. Starting with earnings per share. This quarter we grew adjusted EPS by 20% to the $2.75 and GAAP EPS was $1.85 up 19% from Q2 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 22% year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue included 8% organic growth, 12% growth from acquisitions and a 2% benefit from foreign exchange. Looking at growth by geography. As Marc mentioned, our markets were strong across the globe in Q2. North America grew mid-single digits. Europe grew in the high-single digits. Asia Pacific grew in low-teens with \u2013 including another quarter of very strong growth in China, and the rest of the world also grew in the low-teens. Turning to our operational performance. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 21% and adjusted operating margin was 23.1%, down 10 basis points from Q2 last year. As a reminder, Patheon is the scale acquisition with gross margins and operating income margins lower than the company average. The effect was approximately 90 basis points dilutive to total adjusted operating margins in the quarter in line with our expectations. The addition of Patheon will continue to be dilutive to our adjusted operating margins through Q3. Foreign exchange contributed about 20 basis points to operating margin during the quarter. So net of acquisitions and FX, our underlying operational performance was strong in the quarter at 60 basis points of expansion driven by good volume leverage and productivity, partially offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 47.3% in Q2, down 110 basis points from the prior year. Strong productivity was more than offset by the expected significant dilutive impact of acquisitions. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 20.2% of revenue, which is down 50 basis points versus Q2 2017 and total R&D expense came in at 4% of revenue, down 40 basis points versus Q2 last year. Both of these were primarily due to acquisitions. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q2 was 6.6%. Looking at our results below the line. Net interest expense was $139 million, up $23 million from Q2 last year mainly as a result of the incremental debt related to our capital deployment activities in 2017. Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of $9 million, which is $13 million favorable versus Q2 2017 driven primarily by changes in non-operating foreign exchange. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 12.3% down 80 basis points versus last year primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform and the addition of Patheon. As expected, the adjusted tax rate was slightly higher than last quarter due to the timing of discrete tax planning items. Q2 average diluted shares were 406 million, up 13 million year-over-year. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations for the first half of the year was $1.5 billion and free cash flow was $1.2 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $300 million. This represents 19% year-to-date free cash flow growth. We ended the quarter with $940 million in cash and investments and we returned $70 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. And early in Q3, we completed $250 million of share buybacks. We expect to complete another $250 million later in the year for a total of $500 million for 2018. This is in line with our previous guidance. Our total debt at the end of Q2 was $19.4 billion down $1.5 billion sequentially from Q1. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.3 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA down from 3.8 times last quarter. And wrapping up my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 10.3%, up 20 basis points from last quarter. So now I'll provide you some color on the performance of our four business segments. Starting with Life Sciences Solutions, reported revenue in this segment increased 12% in Q2 and organic revenue growth was 9%. In the quarter, we saw very good growth across all of our businesses in the segment; clinical next-gen sequencing, bioproduction, biosciences and genetic sciences. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 17% and adjusted operating margin was 33.3%, up 140 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull-through, good productivity and had a favorable impact from FX. This was partially offset by strategic investments. In the Analytical Instruments Segment reported revenue increased 13% in Q2 and organic revenue growth was 9%. In the quarter, we saw very good growth across all of our businesses in the segment, chemical analysis, chromo mass spec and electron microscopy. Q2 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments grew 25% and adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, up 230 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw very strong productivity and volume leverage, partially offset by strategic investments. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics Segment. In Q2, total revenue grew 8% and organic revenue growth was 5%. We saw strong growth in our transplant diagnostics and clinical diagnostics businesses and also in the healthcare market channel. Adjusted operating income increased 8% in Q2 and adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, flat compared to Q2 of the prior year. In the quarter, we saw good volume leverage, had a favorable impact from FX and this was offset by strategic investments and business mix. Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Services Segment, which includes the Patheon acquisition, Q2 reported revenue increased 42%. Organic revenue growth was 9%. In the quarter, we saw strong growth across all businesses in the segment, led by our clinical trials logistics business and our research and safety market channel. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 37% and adjusted operating margin was 13.2%, down 50 basis points from the prior year. In the quarter, acquisitions were slightly accretive to the segment margins and we saw good volume leverage. However, this was more than offset by business mix and strategic investments. So now I'll move on to our updated full year 2018 guidance. You saw in the press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance. Let me walk you through the details. I'll start with revenue. We're raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $30 million and tightening the range by $60 million. The $30 million increase to the midpoint consists of three elements. First, $160 million increase in our organic growth outlook for the year. We now see the most likely outcome for 2018 full year organic growth to be 6%. Second, a $20 million increase from acquisitions, reflecting the continued strong performance of Patheon. And third, given the movement in exchange rates, we now expect a less favorable FX environment for the full year which reduces revenue at the midpoint by $150 million. Turning to our adjusted earnings per share. We're increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.07. This reflects the following changes from the prior guidance; a $0.06 reduction due to less favorable FX; a $0.03 reduction due to the expected gross impact of tariffs in the second half of the year; and these two headwinds are more than offset by $0.15 increase reflecting stronger operational performance as well as $0.01 increase due to expected lower interest costs. So to sum this up, our 2018 revenue guidance is now a range of $23.68 billion to $23.86 billion, which represent 13% to 14% growth versus 2017. We now expect acquisitions to contribute about 7% to our reported revenue growth in 2018 and FX is expected to be a benefit of 1%. And our updated adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2018 is now a range of $10.89 to $11.01 with the midpoint of $10.95. This represents growth of 15% to 16% versus 2017. A few other details behind the revised 2018 guidance. We're now assuming that foreign exchange is a $210 million revenue tailwind for the year or 1% and FX tailwind on adjusted EPS is now assumed to be $0.14 or 1.5%. We estimate the gross impact of tariffs on the company for the second half of 2018 is approximately $14 million or $0.03 of adjusted earnings per share. We plan to offset this and have reflected the benefit of these offsets in our updated operational guidance. So there's no net impact to tariffs on 2018. In terms of adjusted operating margins, we continue to expect to deliver 20 basis points to 30 basis points of expansion for the year. Excluding the impact of Patheon, this represents 70 basis points to 80 basis points of expansion, no change from the previous guidance. We expect net interest expense to be in the range of $540 million to $550 million. We're now assuming that other income and expense to be net income of just over $10 million, a slight improvement to our prior guidance due to non-operating FX benefits realized in Q2. We continue to expect an adjusted income tax rate of 12% for the year. And as mentioned in my earlier remarks, we've recently completed $250 million of share buybacks and we expect to complete another $250 million later in the year for a total of $500 million in 2018. This is in line with our previous guidance. The $500 million of buybacks will fully deplete the current authorization. Later in the year, we expect to replenish the authorization at a level consistent with the long-term capital deployment strategy outlined at our recent Analyst Meeting in May. We continue to expect the full year average diluted shares will be in the range of 405 million to 407 million. We assume that we'll return approximately $275 million of capital to shareholders through dividends, no change from previous guidance. And our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures. So it doesn't include any impact from the pending acquisition of Gatan. We're assuming net capital expenditures will be approximately $700 million to $730 million, no change from previous guidance. And for free cash flow, we're expecting about $3.8 billion for the full year, consistent with previous guidance. And, finally, a couple of comments on phasing for the rest of the year. We expect organic revenue growth rate in Q3 to be higher than Q4 due to the strength of the prior year comparison in Q4. Then in terms of adjusted EPS phasing, we expect Q4 to be just over 25% higher than Q3. So, in summary, we delivered another excellent quarter in Q2 and we're in a great position at the halfway point to deliver a very successful year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Congrats. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thank you, Ross. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : So maybe let's start on China, Marc. I mean, the result is just spectacular. You're north of 20%. It's probably going to be the best in the peer group for the quarter. I guess, as you sort of look at the underlying dynamics there, you have some unique exposure, but in general, it sort of implies continued sort of dominance in share and the like. And that's in the face of \u2013 obviously, you made the point on sort of some of the tariffs and uncertainty. How are you feeling about the various end markets there and sort of the cadence for the rest of the year, given maybe some of the incremental uncertainties? Some are worried about on the raw materials or sort of basic industry side. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Ross, thanks for the questions. So let me talk first about China and the performance and then I'll talk a little bit about tariffs. The business is performing extremely well with just over 20% growth in the quarter and about 20% for the first half. Very strong momentum, broad-based across the various customer sets. I was there at the beginning of the quarter and looking forward to going back a little later in the year. One of the things is the customer base is very bullish about their outlook. So, some of the things that you see in the papers about trade and things of that sort is really not a dialog amongst the customer base. So for the customer base it really is business-as-usual and the markets are very strong. We really do have a unique competitive position there because of our scale and depth of capabilities and the scientific labs we have across the country. Our R&D teams thinks that the scale really helps and our long presence in the market does, and you're seeing us really benefit from that from a performance perspective. A quick comment on tariffs. Really, tariffs is really targeting things primarily outside of our industry. So there's really very little exposure. It's not affecting the customer outlook. As Stephen said, there is a gross impact on cost of about $0.03 in the second half of the year from those tariffs that have enacted and scheduled to be enacted. And we are fully going to offset that operationally through our pricing actions and our sourcing and supply chain actions. So we gave extra color on the call because it's something new that everybody in the world is looking at and we want to just articulate it, but we will navigate through that and don't anticipate any issues. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Great. And maybe just one for Stephen. I think you called out, in terms of the EPS cadence for the second half, sort of, implying obviously core growth better in 3Q, but it seems like earnings growth may be better in 4Q given some of the margin dynamics. I just want to confirm, one, that's the case? And then secondarily, I want to see if I heard something right. Did you say that Q4 is going to be 25% above 3Q? I just want to make sure that that's \u2013 because that seems greater in terms of magnitude than what we normally see. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So you got the numbers correct, Ross. I think, a couple of dynamics to call out. One is that the impact of bringing Patheon into the company's numbers and the profitable stub period in Q3 are such that the headwind on our margins in Q3 from the Patheon side of things, equivalent scale to what you've seen in Q2. And then in Q4, we'll have strong margin expansion, really driven by two factors which are non-repeat, some things that happened in Q4 last year, the impact of the hurricane in Puerto Rico. Site was down for a significant amount of time and we expended a lot of cost to get the site back up and running. And the second factor is, we did a large one-time bonus payment in Q4 last year related to the tax reform and that's not going to repeat in Q4 this year. So that gives you strong margin tailwind for Q4, in fact gives you the dynamic to drive that 25% difference. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you so much. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Ross. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Derik. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, just a question on \u2013 so I have one sort of like big picture question and then one more focused one. I think I'll start with the focused question first, like Thermo historically has not been a big player in the small molecule drug quality control, quality assurance market given the Dionex was not yet an (32:17) acquisition. Can you talk a little bit about how you're positioned in the biologics market for QA/QC and sort of like some of the technologies that are required there and sort of \u2013 you do have an opportunity to gain better share. And just curious it's like \u2013 how does the profitability and how do these markets sort of compare to each other when you look at the opportunities in those small molecules and biologics? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, Derik. Thanks for the question. In terms of the QA/QC applications in biologics, we really are considered one of the thought leaders in how that has evolved with the multi attribute method in mass spectrometry that we've partnered with a number of biotech players on this being adopted. So based on the strength of our Orbitrap platform, we're very well positioned, as biologics become a bigger and bigger portion of the total pharma and biotech industry from a QA/QC perspective and the profitability of our mass spectrometry franchise is quite strong. So from that perspective, we really are in a great position to drive sustained growth. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then follow up question just more on the big picture. You've had three really spectacularly strong quarters now of growth. I think you did \u2013 I think it's 8%, 7%, 8% organic revenue growth in the last three quarters. This obviously begs the question about more difficult comps going forward looking at it. I guess is there anything you're sort of seeing on the horizon that could potentially pop up. I guess what are your concerns about the end markets? And what are your concerns about as you look forward and look into next year, I know, it's a little bit too early to give guidance but I'm just sort of curious in like your confidence in sort of being able to sort of maintain the upper end of your 4% to 6% core growth target? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, Derik. Great question. So if I look at where we are, it's very positive environment and at the same point, our competitive position is really being valued by our customers such that they're driving more business to us. You're seeing in the differential growth versus the others in the industry. When I look at the outlook, it's great to have 6% organic growth as our guidance for the year and that assumes that there's a small increase versus our previous guidance in the second half for the year. If the market conditions maintain at the rate that we have seen for the last three quarters then obviously we're going to have a spectacular year. So we are very excited about our second half outlook, our full year outlook and we don't see any storm clouds on the horizon as I think about 2019. Obviously, we'll give you 2019 guidance in late January, but at least sitting here right now it all looks very positive. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. I'll get back in the queue. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. Great quarter. Marc, I'm wondering if you can comment a minute on Gatan. I know you mentioned it in your prepared comments. But just curious how this fits in with FEI overall? How much customer overlap there is? What the opportunity is to maybe cross-sell here? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. So we're very excited about Gatan. It is a really good strategic fit with the business. When you think about what we're doing here is we want to be able to help electron microscopy customers get even more value from their investments in the systems and looking to get really the benefits of the components that Gatan provides to the industry including filters, cameras and software. So the goal here is to make it easier for the adoption of the technology and as you know, electron microscopy business is growing very well. So we're trying to expand the market through this capability. It's an extremely compelling transaction financially as well and we'll get into the details of that when we close the transaction towards the end of the year and we'll lay out all the financials then. But the economics are also very attractive as well. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then as we think about biopharma, you're obviously putting up great numbers, up mid-teens. You commented on gaining share. We did have a peer yesterday talk about budget flush issues. So is it suffice to say, you didn't necessarily see any of that in the quarter? And can you also comment on bioprocess and the trends you saw there? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. So mid-teens growth in pharma and biotech, feel good about that. We saw strength across all of our businesses that serve the customer base and that range from bioproduction was excellent, chromo mass spec, clinical trials logistic and our research and safety channel. So we saw strength across the board, from consumables, production, chromatography instruments, mass spectrometry instruments, so a very good quarter. I think it really reflects the unique customer value proposition that we have and how we are uniquely positioned to drive our customers' innovation and productivity. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then one last quick one for Stephen. Just on CapEx around Patheon. Should we assume that this is kind of the current steady-state run rate? Or how should we think about Patheon CapEx? Will that be increasing going forward? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. I think you'll see CapEx within this range. It's built into the number for the full year. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Tycho. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, and good morning. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Jack. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So obviously, very good growth in the quarter. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on the share gain commentary and just highlight some of the top areas you think this is resonating and just in that, in particular, I'd be curious to get your thoughts on the biopharma services and logistics business. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. So Jack in terms of the share gains, it's quite broad-based. I mean, when I think about the company, you can look at it and say, well, the company as a whole had a very strong quarter. But as you disaggregate the pieces, we fared very well versus the narrower competitors in the field. So our business has performed well. Some of the highlights where I think we saw a nice share gain in the quarter, our bioscience reagents business, our chromatography and mass spectrometry business, our research and safety market channel. Those were the three large businesses all strong. Clinical trials logistics, very strong quarter as customers continue to move more and more of what is in-house activity to a trusted partner like Thermo Fisher Scientific. We're really seeing the benefit there of how customers understand the logic of why we acquired Patheon and they're actually doing even more clinical trials business with us because of it. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And then just as a follow up. I want to dig in on the Specialty Diagnostics performance. That was the one that posted only consistent growth this quarter of 5%. So just talk about what you're doing on the innovation side to get the growth up and any updates on Cascadion would be great? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Sure. So Jack, a good quarter in diagnostics and healthcare, broad-based strength whether it was transplant diagnostics, clinical diagnostics or healthcare market channel. Outside of the business but serving that customer base, we also had good performance in our clinical NGS business serving the diagnostics and healthcare market. Cascadion, got our CE-IVD clearance in the quarter and we are starting commercialization outside the U.S. Not a meaningful contributor this year. Expect it to really start to ramp in 2019 and we'll be showcasing the instrument at the American Association of (sic) [for] Clinical Chemistry Conference, which is happening in Chicago, next week along with a number of other instruments that we are launching across our portfolio. So lots of good things going on in the diagnostics and healthcare business and a very solid quarter with mid-single digit growth. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Looking forward to seeing it then. Thanks guys. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Doug. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Maybe just to start on Patheon. You appear to have done much better than expected in the quarter with Patheon both in terms of revenue and margins. I'm curious if any of the strength is related to Thermo cross-selling to larger biopharmaceutical customers or if it's still too early for that effort to really move the needle. And then moving down the P&L, I'm just curious what the key drivers were to some of the margin improvement and how we should think about sustainability? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. Doug, the integration is going really well and the customer feedback is extraordinarily positive about the combination and also just leveraging the relationships and trust that the two companies have built over time. So it's been very positive. In terms of the revenue synergies, we are clearly seeing a lot of interest momentum pipeline and some wins. But because of the cadence of the business a win today can show up in revenue 18 months from now. So it doesn't affect the short term but it does affect the long term growth prospects of the business. Some of the wins are showing up in the clinical trials business which is a much shorter cycle business. So that's clearly positive. So I feel very good about how that's going and it's been great to be able to raise our outlook for that business in each of the last two quarters. So performing well. Stephen, you want to...? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, from a margin standpoint, it's a combination of the kind of higher level of growth that's printing at a decent margin and then good progress on the synergies. And I'd just remind you one of the key synergies there was using our PPI Business System to make an impact across the operational sites and we're getting good traction there. The teams are very engaged and driving that at a very granular level across the key sites across Patheon's business. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. That's really helpful. And I guess for my second topic I just want to go back to guidance and give you an opportunity to address one thing that's coming up in a few of our discussions this morning. You increased full year core revenue guidance by $160 million which is close to the magnitude of the second quarter beat. By extension, this implies that core revenue growth targets for the second half really didn't change all that materially. I just want to make sure this is just largely a function of conservatism and not something that you're seeing that suggest you shouldn't stick your necks out in spite of the fact that you put up pretty monstrous first half. It sure doesn't seem like there's any issues, but I just want to make sure none of us are missing anything here. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, Doug. It's a good question. We obviously have had a very strong first half. We specifically did raise the outlook a little bit for Q3 and Q4 organically, based on the market conditions. If the market conditions continue the way they were in the first half, it will truly be a spectacular year. Right now there's nothing that we're seeing that is indicating a change in that trajectory. So I feel good about the prudence of the guidance, but obviously our teams are going to focus on maximizing performance and capitalizing on every opportunity. So we don't see any issues, but as always, we want to be able to close the year and meet or exceed expectations. And I think we've put appropriate guidance at this point. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning and thanks for the time. I wonder first if you could just unpack the academic channel for us a little bit. Historically, we've all thought about the NIH as an important barometer and that's something that you flagged lately as being a positive. But there are actually a lot of positive guidelines coming out of Europe now as well and then your China quarter was particularly strong. So wonder if you could unpack academic for us a little bit on a regional basis. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. So, Steve, very strong quarter with high-single-digit growth, just below the company average in Q2. Geographic strength across the board. Starting with the U.S., it's good performance. NIH funds were flowing well and we were really excited by the NIH's announcement in May to allocate $130 million for research based on cryo-electron microscopy which bodes well for future demand. So that $130 million target had no effect, obviously, on what was in the quarter. But for 2019, it's very encouraging. Turning to Europe, very positive with the Horizon program that was announced. So Horizon 2020 is \u2013 we're getting closer to the end of the decade. They announced the next program which is a seven year program, $100 billion commitment to research funding across the continent which really helps because academic institutions like to know in advance of what the funding environment is going to be. So that was a big commitment in Europe. And the UK government preparing for Brexit has really had some very focused initiatives to make sure that they maintain their prior heritage in life sciences research and their ministers have had a number of meetings with industry to talk about their commitment as well. So U.S. looks good. Europe looks good. China continues to be strong and you see that obviously in the results. So very encouraging environment right now in terms of what we're seeing as well as the longer-term outlook across the globe. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just a couple of little housekeeping items. One to follow-up on Doug's question about Patheon, I wonder if you could zoom out a little bit and just talk about how your thinking is evolving about the category. It sounds like you feel very, very good about your performance relative to the category on the funnel. But as we look across the broader pharma services space across trials, CROs and CMOs, it does seem like the environment is good, maybe better than you thought it might be at the time of the deal. Does that impact your thinking? And then on FEI, any color on growth there organically now and forward relative to the broader AI franchise would be really helpful. Thanks so much. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Sure. So the acquisitions that have been integrated over the last couple years are performing extraordinarily well. In terms of Patheon, our pharma services business on a pro forma basis meaning as if we had owned Patheon in the prior year would have been low-double-digit growth in the first half. So very, very strong performance and it's a reflection of good execution and a very good market as well. In terms of electron microscopy, we would have grown as a company 8% with or without the contribution of electron microscopy. Electron microscopy had a good quarter with growth rates, obviously, similar to the company average. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks again. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Marc, can you just talk through the performance in the U.S. in the quarter? I've seen some mixed data points particularly on the pharma side. It would be helpful just to hear your perspective and outlook here. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: We had mid-single digit growth in the U. S. in the quarter. It's good, there's good conditions. Academic funding was good and we didn't really see any dramatic pockets of weakness in the U.S. In fact relative to the last number of years, strong mid-single digit growth is actually a really nice spot to be from the domestic perspective. So, we really didn't see anything meaningful on the weakness side. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then maybe just on industrial applied coming in mid-single digits growth, maybe a little bit lighter than high single in the first quarter, but still pretty healthy. Can you just provide some color on what markets performed well here, how are you feeling about the environment going forward given some various macro data points that are out there? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. Our Analytical Instruments business had strong growth in the quarter, chrom and mass spec, chemical analysis in particular. We obviously had some challenging comparisons in electron microscopy in that segment, still had nice growth. But those would be some of the factors in driving the mid-single digit growth in industrial and applied. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Maybe if I could just sneak one last one in on the M&A side. Obviously, you did the Gatan deal during the quarter adding to the FEI franchise. Can you just talk through the general kind of pipeline going forward, any markets you see as particularly attractive? I know last question you touched, it was CDMO, CRO market. Thoughts on adding to your franchise there or would you prefer to just let Patheon execute for the time being? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. We have a active M&A pipeline across our businesses. And one of the things as we think about is we have a very disciplined M&A process and the selection criteria that we use really has differentiated our performance, right? So while we look at many things we have a very active pipeline. We're going to be very selective in terms of what we do. And we have a lot of firepower, so from the ability to be able to execute on transactions, both management and financially. So we'll continue to progress that pipeline and do the right transactions for strengthening our competitive position as well as creating shareholder value. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is open. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thank you. Marc, to the... Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Good morning, Dan. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Morning. Just only the point that's been made a couple of times already. Obviously, you guys are headed where you've been historically in terms of the organic top line. So I guess when you think about the incremental dollars that are just being put back into the business, I'm curious whether you'd call out certain product areas or categories that are being earmarked to bid for more investment or would you say, you're maybe sprinkling it pretty evenly across the business? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. No, we don't sprinkle it evenly because we run the company in a very disciplined faction and we invest at the right levels so that our businesses have good outlook. There are a few areas that we are putting a bit more money to work because the market conditions were better than we thought and therefore we want to fully capitalize on them, areas like chromatography and mass spectrometry, just given the momentum there and our strong position. We're increasing rates of investment there, would be an example. I would even say the acquisition of Gatan would be an example. It's obviously an M&A move, but we have a lot of momentum in electron microscopy and we want to further bolster those capabilities there, would be an example. In biosciences, an area where I highlighted, it's obviously been an area that shows just the benefits of a good strategy and execution every day of the year. Taking a business that had a number of years of low-single digit growth and we transformed it to mid-single digit, now sustainably high-single digit, that's another area where we've increased our investments in digital, we've increased our investments in the Web to really sustain a very, very bright outlook for that business. You're seeing it in the new product launches, whether it's in flow cytometry, you're seeing it in cell biology. So we have specific areas that we're investing in to capitalize on our competitive position as well as the momentum we're seeing in the market. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Super. And maybe at the risk of crossing Ken here, if I could sneak one more in for Stephen. Just curious, at a high level, whether there's a particular segment that you think there's more margin opportunity over, call, the next year or so when you're just thinking about mix and investment going forward? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. When you think about how it played out over the last couple of years. The volume leverage really comes through strong in, clearly, the higher margin businesses. So Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments have shown great volume pull-through on the organic growth. So that's really where you'll see a lot of the margin expansion of the company. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies & Company. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Most of... Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Hi, Brandon. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : ...my questions have been addressed already, but one for you Stephen. In the context of having raised the full year outlook two quarters in a row now, would be curious if you could just speak to the free cash flow guidance which remains unchanged? And it seems to imply only about 4% growth in the second half. So is that just some conservatism or timing between first and second half of the year? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. It's really around timing. We had a very strong Q4 last year. Look at the two years combined, I think, it's 19% growth for the two years on an average per year, so in terms of free cash flow growth and yes, it's gone up higher in the range of the $3.8 billion and we're going to now work hard to deliver as much free cash flow as we can. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Very good, thanks. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: We have time for one more. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Good morning. A couple of quick things for you guys. I guess first as it relates to Patheon, I believe you mentioned it's growing in the low-double digit so far this year. Just was wondering if you're expecting a similar level of growth as it enters the organic growth calculation in the back half of the year? And then secondly, as it relates to tariffs, I know you called out $14 million or $0.03 which you expect to offset. But just wondering, does that take into account the tariffs that have been more recently proposed, but not implemented or just the tariffs that have been implemented so far? And then I guess finally, in the 9% LPS (sic) [LP&S] growth, just any color on \u2013 that's obviously a very strong number for that segment. How much of that is sort of an increase in the overall end market versus the share gains that you're also calling out there? Thanks so much guys. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So I'll do some of it and I think Stephen will cover some. So in terms of the growth in the Lab Products and Services Segment, as a reminder, the Patheon growth does not flow into the numbers because we haven't anniversaried the transaction. We had very strong performance in our clinical trials logistics business and our channel grew very strong in the quarter. So those were the big drivers there. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. So on the Patheon side, we've got a couple of deferred revenue rev rec comps that we'd be hitting in Q4 and some will hit us in Q3. Underlying the growth in that business is running ahead of the deal model, so when you think about the true underlying pro forma. So it's not going to be a significant contributor in Q3 or Q4, to the total company growth. And then the tariffs piece is really \u2013 we basically baked in what's been enacted and what we expect to be enacted in \u2013 assuming it's mid second half of the year beginning of Q4. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So let me wrap up the call. We're obviously pleased to deliver an excellent first half of the year. We're in a great position to achieve a very successful 2018. And as always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. We look forward to updating you at the end of the next quarter.",

So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our Q3 call and, Ken, happy birthday. I'm very pleased to report that we continued our strong growth momentum and delivered another excellent quarter in Q3. Our team executed very well in a strong market environment and continued to capture opportunities to drive growth. Our outstanding performance underscores the impact of our proven growth strategy. We're clearly delivering a differentiated experience for our customers, and that's driving meaningful share gains across our businesses. We have a lot of highlights to cover this quarter and I'll start with an overview of our financial results. As you saw in our press release this morning, our adjusted EPS grew 13% to $2.62 per share in Q3. Our revenue in the quarter increased 16% year-over-year to $5.92 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 12% to $1.31 billion and our adjusted operating margin in Q3 was 22.1%. The combination of great execution by our team and strong market conditions led to outstanding results again this quarter. Our performance puts us in great position to deliver a fantastic 2018. Now, let me give you a little color on our performance by end market. All of our end markets were strong in Q3. We took advantage of the favorable conditions and effectively leveraged our customer value proposition to drive growth. In pharma and biotech, we delivered high-teens growth in the quarter and continued to see strength in all of our businesses serving this end market. As you know, we're uniquely positioned to enable success for our pharma and biotech customers and that results in significant share gain for Thermo Fisher. Turning to diagnostics and healthcare, we grew in the mid-single digits in the quarter and saw strong growth \u2013 strong demand in this end market. In academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digits. It was great to see a continuation of the positive funding dynamics in the U.S. during the quarter. And finally, in industrial and applied, we delivered high-single digit growth in Q3 led by strong performance across our Analytical Instruments businesses. A quick comment on our overall performance from a geographic lens : we continued to see good conditions in our end markets globally and this was highlighted by another very strong quarter in China where we delivered more than 20% growth. So, it was another great quarter. We executed very well to capitalize on the strong market conditions across the board. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, our results point to our proven growth strategy and our ability to execute consistently over a long period of time. We've been building on our leadership position by making significant investments in R&D, leveraging our scale in high-growth regions, and providing increasing value for our customers. I'm going to cover a few of the highlights from the quarter that reinforces the success of our strategy. As you know, one of the elements of our growth strategy is our ongoing commitment to developing high impact innovative new products. I've highlighted quite a few so far this year and Q3 is another great example of how we develop products that make a huge difference for our customers. We had a number of launches across our businesses in the quarter, but I'll single out a few of the new instruments that we've introduced. First, at the meeting of the American Association of Clinical Chemistry in late July, we launched the Phadia 200 which recently received the CE mark for sale in Europe. This is a fully-automated benchtop system that can perform up to 700 different ImmunoCAP and EliA tests to diagnose allergies and autoimmune diseases. Phadia 200 is perfect for smaller diagnostic labs and its flexible menu of tests minimizes the need to send samples offsite. This helps clinical labs retain control over the samples and improve operational efficiency. At the Microscopy & Microanalysis Conference in August, we launched a number of new products that expand our leading electron microscopy portfolio to enable discoveries for both academic and industrial customers. One of the highlights was our new Thermo Scientific Phenom Pharos desktop scanning electron microscope. This is a first of its kind instrument that features advanced detectors to generate high-resolution images in a benchtop model. It's easy to operate and allows researchers to capture an image in less than 25 seconds. The Phenom Pharos makes advanced microscopy technology accessible to a much broader customer base for a range of material science applications. In our biosciences business, we introduced a new digital microscope for cell imaging during the quarter, the Invitrogen EVOS M5000 system, which is designed to provide biologists with a simplified process for cell imaging that produces publication quality images in minutes. I was thrilled to participate in the unveiling of this new product when I visited our site in Bothell, Washington. Last, in mass spectrometry, we introduced the Thermo Scientific ISQ EM single quad, which raises the standard of performance for productivity in high volume LC-MS labs. This new system has the power to detect and quantify small and large molecules for a range of applications from drug development to manufacturing quality control. Another element of our growth strategy is the advantage we gain by leveraging our scale in emerging and high growth markets. We had strong performance in these regions again in Q3 with China leading the way. We're very pleased that our efforts to expand our presence in these markets have produced strong results for some time, but what's even more exciting is that we see many untapped opportunities for future growth. Take China for example. As I mentioned earlier, we had another outstanding quarter there with strong demand across all of our end markets, but especially from our life sciences customers. As you know, we've been doing business in China for many years, supporting national priorities like better health care, a cleaner environment and safer food. When I think about how the market has evolved, a few years ago there was limited life science research activity in China. Today, it's a growing contributor to our results. And we're benefiting from the Precision Medicine and Cryo-EM Centers that we've established there, which are giving our customers exposure to our leading life sciences technologies. I'm looking forward to spending time with our China team next week to participate in the ribbon-cutting of our new commercial office in Beijing and I also plan on meeting with a number of our life sciences customers who are eager to learn how we can help them advance their work. Now I'll turn to the last element of our growth strategy which is our unique customer value proposition. As a reminder, we leverage our value proposition to help our customers accelerate innovation and enhance productivity. This has allowed us to establish scale relationships that give us differential access to our customers. And, of course, we continue to strengthen our value proposition to build on these relationships and gain share. As an example, the acquisition of Patheon a little over a year ago has further differentiated our value proposition for pharma and biotech customers. We've created a strong pharma services capability by combining Patheon's drug formulation, development and manufacturing services with our clinical trials logistics. With our full suite of services, our customers can better leverage our deep expertise while optimizing their capital investments. We're continuing to invest to further strengthen our pharma services business and began construction in Q3 to expand our manufacturing site in St. Louis. We produce biologic therapies for the treatment of various cancers and inflammatory disorders there. Once completed at the end of 2019, St. Louis will be the largest outsourced single-use biologics site in North America. To enhance our bioproduction offering, we announced during Q3 that we signed an agreement to acquire BD's Advanced Bioprocessing business, which provides media supplements that are highly complementary to our cell culture media. Adding these products will allow us to help customers maximize yield and reduce variability in the production of biologic drugs. So, we continued our strong momentum in each element of our growth strategy in Q3 to become a stronger partner for our customers and widen our lead versus the competition. Before turning to our guidance, I'll give you a quick update on our capital deployment strategy. We made great progress on all fronts. We significantly de-levered, and Stephen will give you those details. In addition, we're on track to deploy a total of $2.2 billion this year. This includes $1.5 billion of M&A. We've closed the IntegenX acquisition and look forward to completing the acquisitions of Advanced Bioprocessing and Gatan. We also continue to have a very active deal pipeline. We will also return $775 million of capital, which is a combination of $275 million of dividends and $500 million of stock buybacks. Let me take a moment to give you a quick update on the integration of Patheon now that we've passed the one year anniversary of the acquisition. The integration continues to go very smoothly, the business is performing well and our results are running ahead of our original expectations. We're very pleased with the progress we're making in driving revenue synergies, so let me give you a couple of examples. First, we had some nice quick wins in our clinical trials business by providing these services to our legacy Patheon customers. Second, legacy Patheon is benefiting from access to our broader customer base, which bodes very well for the future. We have a number of revenue synergy opportunities as a result of the combination, and we're excited about the growth outlook for our pharma services business. So we continue to successfully execute our capital deployment strategy to create value for our customers and shareholders. Turning to our guidance, as you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. The increase is based primarily on our strong operational performance, partially offset by a less favorable foreign exchange environment. We're raising our revenue guidance to a new range of $23.99 billion to $24.09 billion for 2018, resulting in 15% growth over 2017. In terms of adjusted EPS, we now expect to deliver between $11 and $11.06 per share. This will lead to 16% to 17% growth over the strong adjusted EPS performance we delivered in 2017. So, to summarize our key takeaways from Q3, we executed well to take advantage of the strong conditions across our end markets, we're continuing to build on our leadership through our proven growth strategy, we're deploying our capital to strengthen the company and create shareholder value, and we're effectively delivering a differentiated customer experience to drive share gain. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our third quarter results for the total company, provide some color on our four business segments, then conclude with our updated 2018 guidance. Before I get into the details of our financial performance, I'll provide a high level view of how the third quarter played out versus our expectations during our last earnings call in July. As you saw in our press release, we had a very strong quarter with 10% organic growth and 13% adjusted EPS growth. It was driven by great operational execution and continued strong market conditions. We delivered $0.12 more adjusted earnings per share in Q3 than we had assumed at the midpoint of our previous guidance. This is driven by $0.10 stronger operational performance and $0.05 better below-the-line driven by FX, lower interest costs and lower tax. And this is partially offset by $0.03 of increased reinvestment in the business; so another excellent quarter. Let me share some more details on Q3. Starting with earnings per share, this quarter we grew adjusted EPS by 13% to $2.62 and GAAP EPS was $1.75, up 31% from Q3 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 16% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue increase included 10% organic growth, 7% growth from acquisitions, and a 1% headwind from foreign exchange. Looking at growth by geography, as Marc mentioned, our markets were strong across the globe in Q3. North America and Europe both grew in the high-single digits. Asia-Pacific grew in the low-teens including another quarter of very strong growth in China. And rest of the world grew in the high-single digits. Turning to our operational performance, Q3 adjusted operating income increased 12%, and adjusted operating margin was 22.1%, down 80 basis points from Q3 of last year. As expected, the impact of acquisitions and FX was approximately 90 basis points in the quarter. So, operationally, we increased margins 10 basis points. We saw very strong volume leverage and good contributions from our PPI Business System, but this was largely offset by business mix and strategic investments. Regarding the investments, given the continued strong market conditions and a very strong topline growth, we're taking the opportunity to selectively increase investments in a few of our businesses to help maximize our long-term growth prospects. We've been able to make these additional investments and deliver 12% year-over-year increase in adjusted operating income dollars, so a very strong quarter. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 46.2% in Q3, down 220 basis points from the prior year. Strong productivity was more than offset by the expected dilutive impact of our acquisitions and unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 20.1% of revenue, which is down 120 basis points versus Q3 2017, and total R&D expense came in at 4.1% of revenue, down 20 basis points versus Q3 last year. Both of these were primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q3 was 6.8%, up 20 basis points from Q3 2017, reflecting the increase in strategic investments. Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense was $121 million, down $11 million from Q3 last year, driven primarily by improved interest income. Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of $14 million, which is slightly favorable versus Q3 2017, driven primarily by changes in non-operating foreign exchange. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 11.5%, down 30 basis points versus last year, primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform. The adjusted tax rate was lower than last quarter due to the timing of discrete tax planning items. Q3 average diluted shares were 406 million, up 6 million year-over-year. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations for the first nine months of the year was $2.7 billion and free cash flow was $2.3 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of about $400 million. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and investments. Early in Q4, we've repurchased $250 million of our shares, bringing the total repurchases for 2018 to $500 million. This is in line with our prior guidance. We returned $70 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $18.8 billion, down $600 million sequentially from Q2. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.1 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA, down from 3.3 times last quarter and down from 4.4 times at this point last year. This demonstrates the strength of our cash flow and our commitment to delever. Wrapping up my comments in our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 10.4%, up 10 basis points from last quarter and up 60 basis points from Q3 last year, as we continue to generate very strong returns. Now, I'll provide some color on the performance of our four business segments, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Reported revenue in this segment increased 9% in Q3 and organic revenue growth was 10%. In the quarter, we continued to see strong growth in this segment led by bioproduction, biosciences, and clinical next-gen sequencing. Q3 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 32.9%, up 20 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull-through and good productivity, which is partially offset by unfavorable business mix, strategic investments and the expected impact of acquisitions. In the Analytical Instruments Segment, reported revenue increased 12% in Q3 and organic revenue growth was also 12%. In the quarter, we saw very good growth across all of our businesses in the segment. Q3 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments grew 15% and adjusted operating margin was 22%, up 40 basis points year-over-year. We saw very strong volume leverage and productivity, partially offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics Segment, in Q3 total revenue grew 6% and organic revenue growth was 7%. Strong growth in this segment was led by our healthcare market channel and the transplant and clinical diagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income increased 2% in Q3 and adjusted operating margin was 25%, down 90 basis points from the prior year. In the quarter, we saw good volume leverage and productivity. This was more than offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. Finally, in the Lab Products and Services Segment, which includes the legacy Patheon business, Q3 reported revenue increased 28%, organic revenue growth was 11%. In the quarter, we saw strong growth across all businesses in the segment led by our clinical trials logistics business and our research and safety market channel. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 12.1%, down 50 basis points from the prior year. In the quarter, we saw good volume leverage and productivity. However, this was more than offset by business mix and strategic investments. I'll now move on to our updated full year 2018 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance. Let me walk you through the details. I'll start with revenue. We're raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $275 million and tightening the range by $80 million. The $275 million increase to the midpoint consists of two elements : a $315 million increase in our organic growth outlook for the year and $40 million less favorable FX. The $315 million organic growth increase factors in the stronger Q3 performance and a $45 million organic increase for Q4. So our guidance now assumes 7% organic growth for the full year. Turning to adjusted earnings per share, we've increased the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.08. This reflects the following changes from the prior guidance : a $0.17 increase in operational performance, which is $0.12 in organic growth pull-through and $0.05 lower interest and tax; a $0.01 reduction due to less favorable FX; and a decision to make $0.08 in additional strategic investments to maximize our long-term growth prospects. To sum this up, our 2018 revenue guidance is now a range of $23.99 billion to $24.09 billion, which represents 15% growth versus 2017. Acquisitions are expected to continue to contribute about 7% to our reported revenue growth in 2018, and FX is expected to be a benefit of 1%. Our updated adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2018 is now a range of $11 to $11.06, with a midpoint of $11.03. This represents growth of 16% to 17% versus 2017. Now I'll provide a few other details behind the revised 2018 guidance. We're assuming that foreign exchange will be about $170 million revenue tailwind for the year, approximately 1%. The FX tailwind on adjusted EPS is assumed to be $0.13 or 1.4%. There's been a slight change in the composition of tariffs, but we continue to expect that the 2018 gross impact for the company is $14 million, and we're executing actions to fully offset the impact in 2018, so we continue to expect that tariffs will have no net impact this year. We now expect adjusted operating margin expansion to be between zero and 10 basis points for the year. Operationally, we're increasing margins 50 to 60 basis points. And as expected, the impact from acquisitions is approximately 50 basis points. We expect net interest expense to be in the range of $525 million to $530 million, it's a reduction of approximately $20 million from our previous guidance due to higher interest income and active management of our debt portfolio. We're now assuming other income and expense to be net income of just over $20 million, a slight improvement to our prior guidance due to non-operating FX benefits realized in Q3. We expect an adjusted income tax rate of 11.9% for the year, a 10-basis point improvement from our prior guidance due to benefits from our tax planning. Our guidance continues to assume $500 million of share buybacks in 2018. As I mentioned earlier, all of these have now been executed. We expect that the full year average diluted shares will be in the range of 405 million to 407 million, no change from previous guidance. We continue to expect to return approximately $275 million of capital to shareholders through dividends. Our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures. We continue to assume that net capital expenditures will be approximately $700 million to $730 million. And for free cash flow, we're expecting about $3.8 billion for the year, consistent with previous guidance. So, in summary, we delivered another excellent quarter in Q3 and we're in a great position to deliver a very successful year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to open it up for Q&A. Operator : Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. Congrats on the quarter. Marc, I want to start with the Analytical Instruments business. Great organic growth, the comp was even more difficult than it was last quarter. Can you maybe parse out some of the components there? How much of that was FEI versus other pieces? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. So, as a reminder \u2013 Tycho, thanks for the question. We have three businesses in our Analytical Instruments business : materials and structural analysis which is electron microscopy and spectroscopy; chromatography mass spectrometry and chemical analysis. All three businesses had double-digit growth; very strong quarter. It was great to see continued momentum in electron microscopy; orders were strong. Chromo mass spec really doing a great job. And chemical analysis actually really had a terrific quarter. So great strength across the businesses. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then maybe just for the follow-up, you're obviously putting up exceptional numbers. The comps do start to get a little bit more difficult and, obviously, the macro outlook is a little bit shaky. So, as we think ahead to next year, I'm just wondering if you can talk qualitatively about what markets you think could accelerate versus decelerate. Do you think pharma given that you've anniversaried Patheon and added BD Biosciences can actually accelerate? And how do you think about China heading into next year as well? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: The end markets are fantastic, Tycho, and we see that across geographically, we see it across the four end markets. The company is executing very well. I feel very proud of how our colleagues are working around the world. And we are gaining share across a large number of businesses, and that bodes well for an excellent 2019. So we're super excited. And of course, we look forward to giving the guidance and all the details. We'll do that in late January next year. But outlook is great. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good morning, guys, and happy birthday, Ken. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thank you, Ross. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : I'm sad I didn't get the birthday invite for the 30th, but maybe next time. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Don't hold your breath. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : So maybe let's start on the pharma channel. Obviously, given what we've seen in terms of your results, it feels like pretty broad strength there as well as on the bioproduction side. So, give us a feel for kind of how you're thinking about the sustainability of some of the trends there and where you feel like you're gaining share, because I think it's probably still benefits from actions made years ago as you kind of integrated into that customer base and, obviously, touched them in a unique way. So just give us a feel for kind of the product segments and the duration in terms of some of that upside we're seeing. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, Ross, another very strong quarter in pharma and biotech. And from a business perspective, bioproduction was very strong, chromatography and mass spectrometry, the research channel and our pharma services business, which includes both clinical trials and legacy Patheon, all had very good quarters. And if I omitted any, it wasn't because they didn't have good quarters. We saw excellent momentum across our portfolio. The way I think about the end market is we have very scale relationships with these customers, whether they're smaller companies or larger ones. Commercially, we serve them in a different way. We have great access to the decision-makers because of the scale of those relationships. And every time we bring a new capability in, it allows us for yet another dialog across the whole portfolio, not just what we add to it organically or inorganically, and that has driven great momentum in the business. So, the [objectives] that we outlined in 2006 in terms of how we're going to serve pharma and biotech, it keeps getting better and better in terms of our performance and, obviously, the underlying end market is strong as well. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : And maybe, Stephen, just on the margin side, obviously, we knew the pull-through this quarter wasn't going to be as good, and next quarter, obviously, you're forecasting fantastic margin expansion. Maybe can you just give us a little bit of the puts and takes because I've gotten just a bunch of questions, but I know there was some pieces particularly around Patheon that impacted this quarter and kind of reverse next quarter. So, any other detail around that sort of sequential cadence would be helpful. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. So, in terms of margins in the current quarter, the business mix is really driven by the very high growth across the company. All businesses grew well, but just in terms of the relative growth and the relative profitability of the parts created some of the mix dynamics. So, Specialty Diagnostics, which had a great quarter for diagnostics, but was significantly below the company average, but higher than the average profit margin so that put some mix pressure on the reported margins. And then in the Lab Products and Services, we got some relatively lower profitability service lines, for example, the channel which had exceptional growth, and that also then created some reported mix pressure in the margins. Overall, we grew adjusted operating income dollars 12%, which is really what counts at the end of the day, but in terms what the noise, in terms of the mix of how that came through. As think about Q4, we're looking at more \u2013 a tighter range of organic growth across the businesses, so there's less mix dynamic. Also sequentially, Q3 to Q4, as you said, we've got the pharma services business will be significantly more profitable due to the non-repeat of the impact of the hurricane that we had in Q3 last year. It's one of the largest pieces to that. So those are the main drivers. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks and good morning. Marc, I was hoping you could elaborate on what you're seeing on the ground now in China related to trade and tariffs. And given the strength of the quarter, was there anything that you think had pulled forward into the third quarter from the fourth quarter or beyond? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. So, Jack, thanks for the question. China was very strong and another better than 20% quarter. It's better than 20% year-to-date. Bookings once again grew faster than revenue; positive book-to-bill. Reviewed with the team the performance and they feel very good about the outlook. In terms of pulled forward, we're not seeing anything, nothing that we've noticed out of the ordinary in terms of customer buying behavior. But looking forward, as I mentioned earlier, I'll be in China next week and seeing a number of customers, spending time with the team, (34:20) government, things of that sort. It's a great market and we're so incredibly well positioned to serve the various segments from food safety to life sciences to diagnostics. It's just a great market that's served us well in the past, and we look forward to a great future. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And similar to that, just was hoping you could elaborate on what expectations are built into the fourth quarter. You've got a great start to the year, about 8% year-to-date organic. I think that implies about 3% to 4% is caked in for the fourth quarter. So, are you assuming anything related to budget flush? I'm guessing no, but if you could elaborate on what's built in that would be great. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, Jack. Thanks for that. This is an important question. Thank you. So, in terms of the outlook, for Q4, what's implied in our guidance is that we increased our Q4 outlook by about 1 point, as Stephen mentioned, organically. So, when I think about what's assumed, obviously, we're a few weeks into the quarter, so we have good visibility into how things are shaping up. And the assumption on year-end money is the exact same assumption that we've used all year, and it's our normal convention, which is that we will see normal year-end spend relative to the very strong year-end spend we saw last year. And if we see a strong year-end spend or a budget flush beyond sort of the normal, then this will truly be yet another just a spectacular quarter and, either way, we're going to have a fantastic year and setting ourselves up for a great 2019. So, we won't know the budget flush numbers until a couple of weeks left in the year, so it's one of those things where normal is the right way to think about how you do guidance and, if it's better, great, and if it's not, then we're well-positioned to achieve our numbers. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, Marc. Operator : Your next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. It's Mike Ryskin on for Derik. I have a couple of quick questions. You highlighted a few times share gains across the business, meaningful share gains. Can you add a little bit of color where you're seeing some of the biggest strength? I mean, obviously, I think it looks like a lot of its in pharma, but a little bit more color on specific product segments or geographies or customer types. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Mike, thanks for the question. In terms of share gain, we're growing faster than the rate of growth in China. That's through a geographic lens. I would say we're also growing probably faster than the rate of growth in North America as well. From an end market perspective, we're growing faster from a pharma and biotech than others and, from a product perspective, it's fairly broad-based, but it's nice to see continued really strong growth in chromatography and mass spectrometry, that's done very nicely. Our biosciences business is something I featured in our last quarter's call, continues to have great momentum. So that's another area. And bioproduction, looking at what's been reported in terms of results from a couple of companies that reported so far, we grew faster than those that have reported. So, those would be examples. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. And then about the investments you talked about making, again, where are they coming in? The investments you talked about in this quarter and then going forward, is there any area you're emphasizing? And along that line, the Phadia product you launched in Europe, how does that fit in into the market and can you talk a little bit about how that's positioned? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Sure. I'll talk about the new instrument and Stephen will talk about the investments. So, we launched \u2013 we have a very strong allergy and autoimmune franchise globally, and we refreshed one of the key products, which is the lower and in terms of volume instrument platform for smaller labs to be able to run their full menu of allergy and autoimmunity tests on that new updated platform. Why that's relevant is, in many markets, the economics of keeping the tests in-house are better than the economics of sending the samples out. So, by having the ability to serve that smaller customer set with a very up-to-date instrument, it allows them to improve their economics. So we're very excited about that new product launch. And our allergy and autoimmune business continues to perform very well. Stephen, you want to talk about investments? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. So, in terms of the investments, given the strong market conditions and our strong top line growth, we're taking the opportunity to selectively increase investments in a few of the businesses to help maximize long-term growth prospects. So the additional investments are really in four businesses : biosciences, chrome and mass spec, electron microscopy, and pharma services where we're on great growth trajectory and we believe, by selective additional growth investments, we can continue that business momentum. And so the investments are really made to accelerate R&D commercial effectiveness programs and scale up production capacity. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Hey, Doug. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Over the years, we've heard you talk a lot about your value proposition in biopharma and how successful you've been there. It looks like you're gaining share across all end markets, so I'm curious if you'd be willing to provide an update on how you're progressing with your efforts to essentially apply that biopharma playbook \u2013 biopharma value proposition playbook to other end markets? Essentially, how are those efforts progressing? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. So, Doug, thanks for the question. So, the value proposition has done very well in more than just pharma; biotech business has obviously done exceptional there. It's done very well in serving the reference lab accounts around the world from a diagnostics and healthcare perspective where they're very focused on productivity. That's been a big driver. Your big industrial companies also are big adopters of the methodology; the chemical, petrochemical, those types of customers also. So that's a customer lens. But, interestingly enough, when you think about those other segments, our geographic strategy of leveraging our scale in Asia-Pacific and the high-growth regions, that really has served those three end markets incredibly well because we just provided an amazing experience in terms of service and support because of our scale to those markets, and that's allowed us to drive very strong growth beyond just pharma and biotech. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And thank you for that, Marc. And going back to, I guess kind of an earlier question, just building off of an earlier question. You're on track to deliver organic growth well above your three-year target this year. You've talked over the last few calls about what the key drivers have been. I'm curious, one, what's been most surprising? And then, looking ahead, how should we think about your three-year growth target in the context of a strong 2018? Do you think your \u2013 is it fair after four really strong quarters where, on a trailing basis, organic growth has been about 8% to conclude that the core growth rate of the business has improved? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. We're performing very well. The end markets are good, right? And we're executing well and our customers really value what we do for them and that's driven good share gains. So, as you parse through the end markets, we're clearly growing faster than others and that's good performance. When I think about the three-year outlook, we're going to finish this year stronger than what we assumed in the May Analyst Meeting. So, our jumping off point is going to be great. And the fundamentals of our industry are fantastic, right? So, we are excited about the long-term prospects that we outlined in May and we're very well positioned to deliver those results and continue to create significant shareholder value. If I think about how this year has unfolded and am I surprised? No, I'm not surprised. The team has done a really good job. I think the amount of dialog that we've been able to generate post the acquisition of Patheon has been very good for as, for the whole business. It really has just reenergized excitement in the pharma and biotech end market, which was \u2013 been doing really well, so I think that's been really good. And I would say that the North American market is doing better than what we've seen for a number of years, right? And I can't tell you whether that's tax reform or what the underlying driver is, but fundamentally, our North American business is growing at a rate that's better than what we've seen and that really is terrific. So, we feel good about how the year's shaping up. We feel good about our outlook and we're super excited about the midterm outlook as well, as well as long term. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, and thanks for the time. I'll ask one for Marc and one for Stephen. The one for Marc is I wonder if you could zoom out a little bit on the Patheon business and the environment around Patheon. Clearly, the synergies, the commercial synergies and the call point strengths between Patheon, CTS and the rest of your businesses are driving some accelerated interest and synergy there, but do you think that what you and maybe some others are delivering in terms of scale for contract manufacturing is driving a structural change to the way that your partners think about the appeal of that type of service, think that there's been a change to the structural growth rate of that segment of the market? And then, my question for Stephen actually jumps off on some earlier comments on Patheon and it's more about growth in margins into 2019. I think, if we think about 2018, we didn't have a benefit for the full year from Patheon because it wasn't in the organic build fully. We did have a margin impact. Can you talk at all prospectively about what you see for the impact to topline and margins given the announced acquisitions, some of which are closing soon, and Patheon, which of course becomes a part of the organic going forward? And I'll apologize here for the very long-winded question. Thanks, guys. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So, Steve, in terms of the growth rate for pharma services, it's an attractive market. It's got good growth prospects. We're performing well; the business is actually growing faster than what we assumed in the deal model and the outlook looks good. I believe that a company like Thermo Fisher, given its trusted relationships that we've built over a very long time, will have a huge impact on changing the dynamic in the industry. The dialog is certainly very positive, but it hasn't happened yet in terms of change in the structural dynamics of the industry at this point. It's more in the early phases of enthusiasm and exploratory conversations. It's good to see that the revenue synergies actually have materialized faster, right? And remember that it's a very long cycle business. So, what we have is not only what showed up in the P&L, but we have visibility to what the longer-term growth is and it looks good, because the customer feedback is positive. So we'll continue to execute to really drive good growth and good profitability into the business. And Stephen will talk a little bit about margins. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. So, Steve, in terms of the margins, actually Ross's question earlier about the sequential change Q3 to Q4, I highlighted in 2018 the non-repeat of the impact of the hurricane. The other piece for 2018 and the sequential part in our margins is that, for the first nine months, we've been basically bringing in Patheon's financials into the company, incorporating them into the overall company. That's put a pressure on margins of about 90 basis points in the quarter. We're through the anniversary date now, so you don't get that impact going forward. It's just natural margin expansion from that business and the impact of synergies, plus the benefit of the hurricane. So Q4 would be strong margin expansion. As the outlook for 2019, we think about the strong growth in that business both from a market standpoint plus the additional action of the share gain that we're taking in terms of setting up and the synergies, that strong growth will print at a good margin coming into that business to expand \u2013 basically, to expand the margins of the pharma services group. So, you'll see that come in the overall margin expansion of the company in 2019 and beyond. Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks so much. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is open. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks. Marc, on academic demand, obviously the segments that are exposed there are doing well. So, I'm just curious about the extent to which you feel like the businesses are actually benefiting from the funding improvement in the U.S. versus just share gains and some really good execution. Do you feel like at the end of the day organic growth is higher because the NIH budget is up? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely, Dan. The environment is good. It's nice to see how NIH has been funded. I think it's been 20 years or so since NIH had its budget locked up in advance of the fiscal year. It's a long time. So, having clarity going into the first nine months of 2019 on a budget increase is really excellent. And obviously, we're excited about the cryo-electron microscopy program that got $130 million of allocation earlier in the year on a multiyear basis. So that bodes well for us as well. So the market conditions are good in North America. It's flowing through our business and we feel good about that. And we continue to see a good outlook for academic and government around the world. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then maybe just following up with one on the Analytical segment, specific to FEI. Is the semiconductor portion of that business seeing any impact at all from the ups and downs in the macro picture? I know there's a skew towards R&D there and, obviously, things look good overall, so I'm just curious if you've been seeing any fluctuation on that side of the business. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So, thanks. Materials and structural analysis had a very good quarter. Electron microscopy, a portion of that business, had a very good quarter. And the materials science applications, which includes semiconductor and all of the other things from batteries to all of the basic materials science research, did very well. We had good growth in the pieces of it. So it's broad-based strength. And we feel well-positioned to serve the semiconductor market, and also because China, in particular, is building up a large infrastructure to support their own semiconductor needs that bodes well for some period of time ahead. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a bunch. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe, Marc, just on the macro front, given some mixed industrials earnings this week, lower European PMIs this morning, can you just talk through how you're feeling on the more macro sensitive areas like chemical, core industrial markets? Any trends you see in there recently that make you feel kind of constructive going forward? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Patrick, thank you for the question. Chemical analysis is probably our instrument business that probably has the best sort of what's going on purely from a macro GDP perspective; very, very strong Q3 and good bookings growth. Won some nice mining orders which will ship in the future. I always like to look at mining because it gives you a sense of sort of what the longer-term outlook is. And when you see growth there, that typically is positive. So the signs that we see are good, right? And it was nice to deliver high-single digit growth in the industrial and applied markets. So, we pay attention to all of the other macro trends, but in our business things continue to look very good. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful color. Thanks. And then maybe just on the tariff initiatives to minimize that impact, could you just provide a little more color what you guys are doing there and then also the confidence level that we're not going to see any impact in 2019 for you? Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. It's a good question. So, we provided like super-granular detail on tariffs and it will probably stop at some point because the point of doing that is, this category of products is not the focus of what the tariffs are in China in particular because the Chinese government needs these products to advance their initiatives, right? So many of these categories aren't tariffed and it's not been a huge economic impact. And what we've done is we have increased pricing in certain places. We are making adjustments to our supply chain. That takes a little longer obviously, but we're comfortable in our ability to fully offset that impact in 2018 and then make the structural changes that we need to make, if any, to position ourselves for great success going forward. Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Appreciate the color. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Hi, Steve. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Two questions for you. First, Stephen, you made some comments regarding some incremental investment spending it looks like going to $0.03 worth in the third quarter and maybe another $0.05 in the fourth quarter. Just wondering is that something that continues into or through 2019 at a similar type of run rate? Just wondering how sustainable and then one quick follow-up as well. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So, in total, its $0.08; it's roughly $15 million in Q3 and $20 million in Q4. So, we're going to be investing in these businesses appropriately given the top line environment and the long-term outlook. So there will be some continuation going forward, but that's matched with good growth prospects for the businesses. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Got you. And then could you just remind us in the fourth quarter last year, how much of an impact there was to your SG&A from the one-time bonuses you guys paid out related to tax reform? Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yes, approximately $30 million. Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: $30 million. Thank you. Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning. A bit of a follow-up to that last macro question, Marc. Yesterday had two competitors sort of raise a yellow flag around some end markets in Europe. Just curious what you're seeing from a macro perspective there, especially around the pharma and more cyclical industrial areas. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: We got high-single digit growth in Europe. Business is performing well. I was in Europe towards the end of the quarter; met with customers, met with our teams. They feel good about the environment. I'm heading back in November. And the business is performing well. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Fair enough. And then last one would be would love to hear some of your comments on the Advanced Bioprocessing business acquisition, kind of what you see is the growth trajectory of that asset, and how synergistic you see it as with the rest of the Thermo bioprocessing portfolio, and perhaps the size of the customer base would be useful. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah. So, we'll get into more of the details when we close the transaction. It's about a $100 million business; very complementary to our offering in bioproduction. As a reminder, we're the market leader in single-use technologies and in the cell culture media. The supplements, which is what this business is that we're acquiring, used in conjunction with media allows customers to get better yields and reduce variability in the production process. So it's very positive. It's one of those things where it's one plus one equals more than two because you are able to leverage the customer relationships were each company has strength, you're able to optimize offerings, you're able to leverage the expertise of both commercial teams and those relationships. So we're really excited about it and it'll be a nice accretive transaction to the business. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Operator, we have time for one more. Operator : Your next question comes from Daniel Brennan with UBS. Your line is open. Daniel Gregory Brennan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Hey, Marc. Thanks. So, a couple questions. First, going back to biopharma, I'm just wondering, Marc, could you provide a little more color in terms of the share gains that you're seeing? How much of this is from namely you're seeing new customers as you kind of synergize across all the different buckets of products you have versus maybe using a little bit of price that you can now leverage across a broader set of products? Or simply did the customers really appreciate the ability to bundle and just kind of have logistically a lot of your great products in one bag? Just trying to look for little more color on that. Thanks. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, Dan. Thanks for the question. Effectively, every biotech and pharmaceutical customer around the world has some relationship with Thermo Fisher Scientific today. But what we're seeing is that the multiproduct line and service line relationships, we're just getting larger and larger relationships where customers are just working with us and more and more service lines because our businesses are doing a good job of creating value for them, and therefore they want to work with this more closely. And because of the scale of our company, the depth of our offering and the ability to really have very, very meaningful relationships in terms of impact with those customers, they want to spend more time with us and that creates new opportunities. So, that's how I think about it. And we're seeing great momentum across the customer base from that perspective. Daniel Gregory Brennan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, could I ask just on M&A, just kind of what looks most interesting to you today, Marc, from an M&A perspective? And does the more volatile macro, does that help or hurt your ability to do deals? Possibly, it could swing either way, just wondering. Thanks. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Yeah, the pipeline is quite busy, so I feel good about it, and I think the short-term ups and downs of the macro probably don't have a very significant effect on the M&A environment. So, it's our job to apply our strict criteria and identify the right opportunities that are going to strengthen the company and create shareholder value. And I feel good about the one transaction we've closed, the two that we're in the late stage of finalizing, and the many interesting ones we're looking at. So we're well-positioned. Interestingly enough, what's nice as we go into the year is we de-levered from over 4.4 times leverage a year ago to 3.1 times leverage. As we enter 2019, we have a lot of firepower and we'll be able to capitalize on that on the right opportunity. So, it's a very exciting time from a capital deployment perspective. Daniel Gregory Brennan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: Thanks, Dan. Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.: So, let me wrap up the call. With three strong quarters behind us, we're in a very strong position to achieve a very successful 2018. As always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific and we look forward to updating you on our fourth quarter call. Thanks, everyone.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President-Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call. Kenneth J. Apicerno: Good morning and thank you for joining us.

So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc N. Casper: Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our 2018 Q4 and year-end call. As you saw on our press release, we delivered a fantastic year. We had excellent growth momentum all year long and Q4 was no exception. We're pleased to report that we delivered very strong growth in both the quarter and the year. Our team executed well to take advantage of the good conditions that continued across our end markets in 2018. Our performance speaks to the success of our growth strategy and our ability to strengthen our position and continue to gain share. Our commitment to launching great new products, building scale in high-growth in emerging markets, and enhancing our customer value proposition has created a clear competitive advantage for us. We also continue to complement our growth with an effective capital deployment strategy. We completed two nice bolt-on acquisitions that strengthened our customer offering while returning capital to our shareholders and reducing debt. Our outstanding performance in 2018 has further strengthened our leadership position and sets us up for long-term success. I will cover some of the highlights later in my remarks, but first I will hit the financials from the quarter and the year at a high-level. Starting with the quarter, our revenue increased 8% in Q4 year-over-year to $6.51 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 12% to $1.61 billion and our adjusted operating margin expanded 90 basis points in Q4 to 24.8%. We delivered very strong adjusted EPS growth in the quarter with a 60% increase to $3.25 per share. Turning to our results for the full-year. We increased revenue by 16% to $24.36 billion in 2018. Adjusted operating income increased 16% to $5.62 billion, with adjusted operating margin of 23.1%. We are especially pleased to deliver another year of strong earnings performance in 2018 with a 17% increase in our adjusted EPS to $11.12 per share. Our excellent earnings growth is the combination of a well executed growth strategy, effective capital deployment and the power of our PPI Business System that we continuously leveraged to make our better even better. So is a fantastic year by all accounts and that sets us up well for 2018. Now I'll turn to our performance by end market. As I mentioned, conditions remain strong across the board consistent with what we saw all year. And we effectively leveraged our customer value proposition to drive outstanding growth. Let me provide you with some more color. So starting with Pharma and Biotech, the unique depth of capabilities we can offer these customers is clearly giving us an advantage and allowing us to continue to gain share. We delivered low teens growth in the quarter and we continued to see strength in all of our businesses serving this end market. Our leading position in Pharma and Biotech led to mid teens growth for the year. In academic and government, it was great to see the continued strong demand across our life science solutions and analytical instruments businesses in Q4. And our research channel also performed well. We grew in the mid-single digits during the quarter and for the full-year. Turning to diagnostics and healthcare, we had good growth in our transplant diagnostics, amino diagnostics and clinical diagnostics businesses in Q4. In this end market, we grew in the mid-single digits for both the quarter and for the full-year. Finally, in industrial and applied, we delivered 10% growth during the quarter led by strong performance across our analytical instruments businesses. For the full-year, we grew in the high single digits. So we\u2019re really performing at a high level and leveraging our unique scale and depth of capabilities to capitalize on the opportunities we saw across our end markets. We continue to strengthen our strategic position and that bodes very well for our future. Now let me discuss our accomplishments in the context of our growth strategy. We're making great progress across all three pillars of our strategy, and that's really making a difference for our customers, as you can see in our results. Starting with the first pillar of our strategy, high-impact innovation, we continued our strong momentum of new product launches across our portfolio. We're committed to innovation and we invested $1 billion in R&D in 2018. Our impressive lineup of new products during the year, and our strong revenue growth shows that we're getting a great return on that investment. I will recap a few of the highlights. In our analytical instruments business, we continued to strengthen our Thermo Scientific brand by building on our leading platforms across chromatography, mass spectrometry and electron microscopy. In fact, of the top 15 innovations in 2018, that were recognized by the readers of Analytical Scientist Magazine, five of them came from Thermo Fisher. The Orbitrap IDX Tribrid and the Q Exactive UHMR mass spectrometer systems that we launched at ASMS are seeing strong adoption from our customers. And the Q Exactive HF-X that we launched a year-ago made R&D magazine's list of the top 100 innovations in 2018. These examples reinforce the tremendous value we continue to create through our leading Orbitrap franchise, whether our customers are discovering new drugs or working in applied markets such as food safety. In our electron microscopy business, the Verios G4 scanning electron microscope that we launched early in the year is gaining good traction with our Materials Science customers. And it's great to see that our Glacios Cryo-EM for life sciences which we began shipping in 2018 is ramping up nicely, and customer feedback is quite positive. Turning to our life science solutions business, we continue to strengthen our Ion Torrent line of Next-Gen sequences with the GeneStudio S5 series of benchtop instruments launched in 2018, and our Invitrogen EVOS M5000 digital microscope for cell imaging that we highlighted in Q3, is off to a very good start. Finally, in our specialty diagnostics business, we launched two important instruments in 2018, the B\u00b7R\u00b7A\u00b7H\u00b7M\u00b7S KRYPTOR GOLD automated immunoassay system and the Phadia 200 benchtop analyzer to help doctors diagnose allergy and autoimmune conditions. So clearly an excellent year for innovation and we look forward to continuing our momentum in 2019. Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy, our strong performance in high-growth emerging markets, reflects how we\u2019re effectively leveraging our scale to create competitive advantage. These markets now represent 21% of our total revenue or about $5 billion. In 2018 not only do we delivered excellent growth again in China, but we had broad-based growth in these geographies, including double-digit growth in India. Let me spend a couple minutes on China, which as you know is our largest market outside the U.S. Our team has consistently grown our business there faster than the market. We had another strong quarter in China in Q4 and that led to 20% growth for the year. We're clearly benefiting from the scale that we\u2019ve continued to build, which allows us to deliver a differentiated experience to our customers. Our commercial infrastructure, in particular, is driving strong growth and share gain. In 2017, you may recall that we opened two customer demo centers in China to showcase our capabilities in precision medicine and Cryo-EM. In 2018, we established a new commercial office and customer training center in Beijing, and we also opened our first Bioprocess Design Center in November. This new center which is located in Shanghai, features our latest advances in bioprocessing technology. The goal is to facilitate collaboration between our biologics customers and our own application scientists to design optimal bioprocessing solutions for this high-growth market. We continue to increase our scale and depth of capabilities in China to meet the needs of our customers, and we\u2019re excited about the opportunities we have going into 2019. Our confidence comes from China's continued focus on national priorities supporting public health, the environment and food safety, which aligns directly with our company mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition. And we delivered that by leveraging our unique capabilities to help our customers meet their goals for innovation and productivity. What's important here is that we continued to enhance the value we can offer, whether it's a new product innovation or more comprehensive product and services offering. And our results show that our customers really value the unique benefits that we can provide. Let me use our Pharma and Biotech customers as an example. We've been growing significantly faster than the market here for quite some time. And in 2018 our growth accelerated to the mid-teens. Our offering for these customers was very strong and we further strengthened our capabilities through the acquisition of Patheon in August of 2017. Customer reactions have been incredibly positive whether they\u2019re small emerging biotechs that don't have the in-house capabilities or large pharmaceutical customers that need to increase capital efficiency. The integration of Patheon has gone very smoothly. The business are performing well and delivering strong growth, and it's in a great position given the strong commercial momentum that we\u2019re seeing. We continue to increase our capabilities to serve this attractive market, including the expansions of our clinical trial supply chain facility in Rheinfelden, Germany, our Biologics Production Center in St. Louis and our sterile [indiscernible] in Italy and North Carolina. From a synergy perspective, we\u2019re on track to deliver on our [indiscernible] synergy targets of $120 million. Our PPI Business System is having a significant positive impact on this business. So we are excited about the opportunities we have through our leading Pharma Services offering. There's still much more to be done, but we feel very good about the outlook for this business based on our progress to date. To wrap up our growth strategy discussion, we're committed to strengthening our position to be the best possible partner for our customers, and we're clearly seeing the results. Turning now to capital deployment, as you know we have a great track record here in creating value for our shareholders by being good stewards of capital and we continued that in 2018. First our goal is to reduce debt to strengthen our balance sheet following the Patheon acquisition. We started the year with 4x leverage and we ended the year with just over 3x leverage after reducing debt by $2 billion. Second, we deployed a little more than a $0.5 billion on two bolt-on acquisitions. The largest was the advanced bioprocessing business of Becton Dickinson that we closed in Q4, which added a complementary self portrait [ph] products for our Biologics production customers. We also continued to return capital to our shareholders buying back $500 million of stock during the year and increasing our dividend by 13% versus 2017. One last comment here, you saw our announcement on Monday regarding the sale of our Anatomical Pathology business, which is incorporated into our 2019 guidance. Once we close which we expect in Q2, the transaction will give us additional capital to put work -- put to work over time to create shareholder value. Stephen will give you more details during his remarks. So it was a very productive year from a capital deployment perspective as well. To summarize our performance, our strong Q4 really capped off a fantastic year on all fronts. Our team executed very well to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth. We strengthened our industry leadership by advancing our growth strategy and continuing to gain share. We also effectively deployed our capital to create significant value for our customers and our shareholders. Looking ahead as you would expect, we're planning to extend a long track record of consistent and strong financial performance in 2019. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factored into our revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly cover the highlights. In terms of our revenue guidance, we expect to deliver between $24.88 billion and $25.28 billion in 2019, which would result in a reported revenue growth of 2% to 4%. We're initiating adjusted EPS guidance for 2019 in the range of $12 to $12.20 per share. This will lead to 8% to 10% growth year-over-year. Our outstanding results in 2018 really sets us up for another successful year ahead. With that, I will now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Great. Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I will begin with an overview of our fourth quarter and full-year results for the total company. Then I will provide some color on our four segments and conclude with a detailed review of our 2019 guidance. Before I get into the details of our financial performance, I thought it would be helpful to provide a high level view of how the fourth quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of the last earnings call. As you saw in the press release, we had a strong finish to 2018, delivering 8% organic growth in Q4 and for the full-year. This is driven by continued strong market conditions, great operational execution and continued share gains. From an earnings standpoint, we delivered adjusted EPS that was $0.09 higher than the midpoint of our previous guidance. This is driven primarily by pull through on our strong organic growth and to a lesser degree by less adverse FX environment. For full-year 2018 we delivered 8% organic growth, 16% growth in adjusted operating income, and 17% growth in adjusted earnings per share. Overall, excellent financial results in 2018. Now let me give you more color on our performance. Starting with our earnings results, as you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS in Q4 by 16% to $3.25. For the full-year, adjusted EPS was $11.12, up 17% versus 2017, GAAP EPS in the quarter was $2.22, up 71% from Q4 2017; and for the full-year, GAAP EPS was $7.24, up 30% versus the prior year. On the top line, our Q4 reported revenue grew 8% year-over-year. The components of our Q4 reported revenue increase included 8% organic growth, approximately 1% growth from acquisitions, and a foreign exchange headwind of approximately 2%. For the full-year 2018, reported revenue increased 16% year-over-year. This include an 8% contribution from organic growth, 7% positive impact from acquisitions, and a 1% benefit from foreign exchange. Looking at growth by geography, our markets were strong across the globe in Q4. North America and Europe both grew in the high single digits, Asia-Pacific grew in the low teens, including another quarter of very strong growth in China and rest of the world grew in the mid-single digits. For the full-year, North America grew in the mid-single digits, Europe and the rest of the world grew in the high single digits, and Asia-Pacific grew in the mid-teens. Turning to our operational performance, Q4 adjusted operating income increased 12% and adjusted operating margin was 24.8%, up 90 basis points from Q4 of last year. We feel strong productivity from our PPI Business System and good volume contributions partially offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. For the full-year, adjusted operating income increased 16%. And adjusted operating margin was 23.1%, which is 10 basis points lower than 2017. We feel strong productivities from our PPI Business System and good volume contributions. However, this was more than offset by the impact of acquisitions, strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. Moving onto the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 46.9%, down 10 basis points from Q4 prior year. In the quarter, strong productivity on volume pull through was more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. For the full-year, adjusted gross margin was 46.7%, down a 150 basis points from 2017, strong productivity of volume pull through was more than offset by the impact of acquisitions, unfavorable business mix, and strategic investments. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 18.3% of revenue, which is down 90 basis points versus Q4 2017, driven by a strong top line growth. And total R&D expense came in at 3.9% of revenue, flat compared to Q4 last year as we continue to reinvest in our businesses. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q4 was 6.2% and for the full-year was 6.5%. Looking at results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $127 million, down $19 million from Q4 last year, driven primarily by lower level of debt and improved interest income. Net interest expense for the full-year was $530 million, an increase of $19 million from 2017. Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of $12 million higher than Q4 2017, primarily due to changes in nonoperating foreign exchange. In 2018 as a whole, we saw a $27 million of nonoperating income benefit from FX. At this point we do not expect majority of this to repeat in 2019. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter were 12.2%, down 110 basis points versus Q4 last year and in line with our previous guidance. Our full-year adjusted tax rate was 11.9%, which is a 110 basis points lower than full-year 2017, primarily reflecting the beneficial impact of U.S tax reform. Q4 average diluted shares were 405 million, 0.5 million shares higher year-over-year. For the full-year, average diluted shares of 406 million, up 8 million from 2017. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the full-year, cash flow from continuing operations was $4.54 billion and free cash flow was $3.83 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of approximately $700 million.  Our primary focus for use of our cash flow in 2018 was to reduce debt post the acquisition of Patheon. Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $19 billion, down $2 billion from the prior year. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.1x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, down from 4x at this point last year and down from 4.4x immediately post the Patheon acquisition. This demonstrates the significant strength of our cash flow and our commitment to maintain a solid investment-grade debt rating. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash. During 2018, we also continued returning capital to shareholders with $500 million of share buybacks and $275 million in dividend. In addition, as Marc mentioned, we successfully deployed capital to strengthen our customer value proposition through strategic acquisitions, including our recent acquisition of Advanced Bioprocessing. To wrapping up my comments and our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 10.9%, up 50 basis points from last quarter and up 90 basis points from Q4 last year as we continue to generate very strong returns. Now I will provide you with some color on the performance of our four business segments for the quarter, starting with Life Science Solutions. In Q4, reported revenue in the segment increased 8% and organic revenue growth was also 8%. In the quarter, we continued to see strong growth in this segment led by the bioproduction, biosciences, and clinical next-gen sequencing businesses. Q4 adjusted operating income in life science solutions increased 11% and adjusted operating margin was 36.8%, up a 130 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong productivity and volume pull-through, which is partially offset by unfavorable business mix, the impact of acquisitions and strategic investments. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 11% in Q4 and organic revenue growth was 12%. In the quarter, we continued to see very good growth across all of our businesses in the segment. Q4 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments grew 20% and adjusted operating margin was 26.6%, up 210 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw a very strong volume leverage, good productivity, and benefited from positive business mix. This was partially offset by strategic investments. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics segment, in Q4, total revenue grew 4% and organic revenue growth was 5%. Growth in this segment was led by our transplant diagnostics, neuro diagnostics, and clinical diagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income decreased 4% in Q4 and adjusted operating margin was 24.5%, down 190 basis points from the prior year. In the quarter we saw good volume leverage. However, this was more than offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. Finally in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q4 reported revenue increased 8%. Organic revenue growth was 9%. In the quarter, we saw strong growth across all our businesses in the segment led by the Pharma Services business. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 14% and adjusted operating margin was 13.1%, which was higher than the prior year by 60 basis points. In the quarter, we saw good productivity and volume leverage. This was partially offset by strategic investments and business mix. With that, I would like to review the details of our 2019 guidance. We're initiating a 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range of $12 to $12.20, which is 8% to 10% growth over 2018. This includes $0.10 of net dilution from the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business that we announced earlier this week. In terms of revenue, our guidance range is $24.88 billion to $25.28 billion, which is growth of 2% to 4% over 2018. Let me now cover the key assumptions that we factored into our full-year 2019 guidance. We are expecting to deliver 5% organic revenue growth in 2019. With regards to FX, in 2019 we are assuming that [indiscernible] year-over-year headwind of approximately $400 million of revenue or 1.6% and $0.21 of adjusted EPS or 1.9%. The majority of this headwind is expected in the first half of the year. As I mentioned, our guidance reflects the divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business, which I referred to you as the AP business. In 2018, this business had revenue of approximately $315 million, of which approximately $100 million was sold through our channel businesses. We will continue to sell AP products through our channels after the divestiture. To write-off the estimated $0.10 dilution impact of 2019, we are assuming the transaction closes in Q2. This would create a year-over-year headwind of approximately $170 million of revenue and $60 million headwind of adjusted operating income. Both of these are net of the retained channel business. In the calculation of the adjusted EPS impact, we're assuming that the net sale proceeds are placed on deposits and earn interest income for the remainder of the year. The cash taxes and transaction fees related to the sale are expected to be approximately $125 million. These will be reflected in our free cash flow in 2019. We expect the acquisition to be completed in 2018 will contribute approximately $85 million to our reported revenue growth in 2019. This is principally from the acquisition of Advanced Bioprocessing. We are assuming that there is no change in the trade tariff environment in 2019. This means that our guidance includes the year-over-year headwind from tariffs of approximately $30 million or $0.07 of adjusted EPS to reflect the full annualized gross impact of the tariffs that are currently in place. Turning to the adjusted operating margin, we are assuming that we offset a 20 basis point headwind from tariffs on the sale of the AP business and deliver 60 basis points of expansion year-over-year. Moving below the line, we are assuming $1.25 billion of debt repayments in 2019, and we expect net interest expense to be about $480 million. This is approximately $50 million lower than 2018 and is driven by lower average debt level and higher cash balances, partially offset by assumed higher interest rates. We are assuming that other net income will be about $20 million, which is $18 million lower than 2018 due to assumed lower below the line FX benefits in 2019. We expect that 2019 adjusted income tax rate to be 11%. The improvement from our 11.9% rate in 2018 primarily reflects the finalization of our tax planning initiatives tied to U.S tax reform. We are assuming net capital expenditures to be between $800 million to $850 million for the year. This represents an increased investment of approximately $100 million over 2018, driven by capacity and capability expansions in our Pharma Services and bioproduction businesses. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $4.1 million in 2019. The increase over 2018 is primarily driven by expected strong earnings growth. In terms of capital deployment, we are assuming that we will return approximately $300 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends and that guidance also assumes a total of $750 million of share buybacks in 2019, which were completed earlier this month. We estimated full-year average diluted share to be approximately 403 million, and our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions and with the exception of the sale of the AP business, our guidance does not assume any future divestitures. Finally I want to touch on quarterly phasing for the year. In terms of organic revenue growth, we are expecting that Q4 is lower than the yearly average, but the other three quarters are about the same level of growth. In terms of adjusted EPS, we are expecting the same phasing of 2018 when you look at each quarter as a percentage of the total year. So at a high level, in 2019, we expect to deliver 5% organic revenue growth and 8% to 10% adjusted EPS growth. Embedded in the adjusted EPS growth is the headwind of approximately 3% from the -- from FX and the sale of the AP business. The underlying adjusted EPS growth is 11% to 13%.In summary, our 2019 guidance reflects the continuation of very strong financial performance. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth J. Apicerno: Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. Congrats on the quarter. Marc, I want to start maybe just in terms of what\u2019s embedded in guidance for Pharma. Obviously, that\u2019s been such a meaningful growth driver for you. It could be up double-digits again this year and how are you feeling about customer M&A? And then any update there on kind of pay down revenue synergies and the St. Louis expansion on [indiscernible]? Marc N. Casper: Sure. Tycho, thanks and good morning. We're assuming in terms of the year with 5% organic growth for the full-year. We are assuming high single-digit growth in Pharma and Biotech is embedded in the guidance based on the strength of the end market and how well our value proposition is resonating with these customers. We expect the year of continued share gain. In terms of the industry consolidation, as you know, we typically benefit from that consolidation because those customers are looking for synergies and given the unique capabilities that we have, we are very much part of delivering the synergies to those customers. And we\u2019ve already had meetings with some of the companies that are thinking about getting bigger and that creates good opportunities going forward. In terms of the receptivity to our Patheon acquisition, which we call Pharma Services, the customers are extremely excited that Thermo Fisher has expanded our capabilities there beyond our historical clinical trials business, and we have a very strong set of wins commercially and that bodes well for the future. And timeline for our St. Louis expansion, it should be completed towards the end of the year, so revenue really is a 2020 event from that expansion. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then for a follow-up, can you just comment on the decision to sell Anatomical Pathology? Was it really just a function of being a slower growing business in noncore? And are you looking at other divestitures? I know there's nothing embedded in guidance for additional [indiscernible]? Marc N. Casper: Yes, so Tycho, the Anatomical Pathology business as you know, our job as a management team is really to create shareholder value. And we think that the transaction is both good for Thermo Fisher and good for the Future of the AP business. And we don't have any other divestitures that we're contemplating at this point of time. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you. Marc N. Casper: Thanks, Tycho. Operator : Next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Ross Muken : Good morning, guys, and congrats. So maybe, Marc, just picking up China, obviously lot of headlines, but it continues to be a huge sort of [indiscernible] of strength for you. I guess, how are you thinking about sort of progression of that business this year and have you seen anything in the phasing of orders, whether in the end of 4Q from a month-on-month perspective or into early this year that gives you any pause in any parts of the business? Marc N. Casper: Yes, Ross, thanks for the question. In terms of China, very strong year, continuing really a trend of many very strong years. And as a reminder, the 5-year plan within China is very focused on expansion of healthcare and improving environmental protection and food safety. It's really creating an improved quality of life for China. So there is strong demand underlying within the market and because of our unique competitive position, we\u2019ve continued to outpace the market growth. Orders were strong throughout the year. The phasing in Q4 was very good. We did spend time in person with our China leadership team in the first week of January and they\u2019re quite bullish about the prospects for 2019 in terms of both what's going on in the market in terms of -- and also terms of how our customers are perceiving our capabilities and the pipeline of momentum. So 20% organic growth for the year, a very strong fourth quarter as well, good orders. And I\u2019m looking forward to going to China at the end of this quarter to spend time with our team and customers. Ross Muken : Excellent. And maybe just one clarification on the guide and then sort of a follow-up on it. I'm guessing as with prior practice, Gatan is sort of not contemplated or the accretion from that in the guide given your commentary on sort of revenue expectations for the year in terms of M&A. And then secondarily, post Anatomical Pathology assuming that closed in the second quarter, you have a pretty substantial warchest now. How are you just thinking about what we should think from Thermo this year in capital deployment wise? I mean, I know we got the buyback, but more M&A focused just given it seems like you\u2019ve got is bigger sort of [indiscernible] and balance sheet capabilities you\u2019ve had in some time? Marc N. Casper: So, Ross, in terms of Gatan, we don't have that in our results. So we will do that as soon as that closes and our expectation is that it will close in the back half of this year. In terms of the capital deployment, as you know in our long-term 3-year model, primarily we spend and deployed capital on M&A. And we do that over time and we strengthened the balance sheet substantially and Anatomical Pathology will give us even more firepower to deploy over time. And as you know we're incredibly disciplined, so we don\u2019t know the timing of M&A, and we\u2019re not particularly focused on the awareness doing the right deals for our shareholders to create value and over time you will see us continue to deploy capital. From return to capital perspective, as Stephen said, we've done our buybacks and we're assuming in the model for the year. Ross Muken : Excellent. Thanks, Marc. Operator : Next question comes from Derik De Bruin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Derik De Bruin : Hi. Good morning. Two questions. The first one would be talking about Patheon, I think one of the concerns when you did the transaction was the fact that the margins in the business were quite a bit lower than Thermos. Can you talk about where the gross margin operating margin is on the Patheon business now and sort of what improvements you\u2019ve done on that one? And then I\u2019ve a follow-up. Marc N. Casper: Yes, so from the Patheon business, our -- as you know, when we acquired the business, it was kind of a mid single-digit type growth business. And where we have really focused in year one is in two different things. The first of which is to accelerate the momentum of that business and we grew just about 10% for the year in that business. It was really nice to see that step up in momentum. So that was the first. The second was to apply PPI widely across the network and that is having a huge impact on margin. So we are in the mid-teens margins now. We will expect that to be increase slightly this year. And the reason for that is we have a couple large expansions that we're doing in St. Louis and in our [indiscernible] finish network, and when you do that you actually higher the quality and production people in advance so that they\u2019re trained in advance of when the capacity comes online, so you can get the benefit. So you expect that margins will be similar this year, and then in the future you would see very nice expansion going forward. So that's how I would think about where we are with the Pharma Services business. Derik De Bruin : Great. And then just a follow-up on the academic and government market. I mean, we\u2019ve obviously had some -- the shutdown in the U.S., we've got Brexit and some other government shenanigans going on. I guess, what do you think about the academic and government market and should we model that a little bit more conservatively in Q1, given all the moving parts? Marc N. Casper: Yes. So what I would say is for embedded in our guidance for the year is low single to mid single-digit growth in academic and government. We had mid single-digit growth in 2018 in the market. And obviously what we are just paying attention to is a little bit more on Europe. We've seen good strength in China. As you know, 70% of the U.S government was funded or is funded through September 30. So the most important thing was NIH and so that's been fine and looks good for the year. And we\u2019re just paying attention to Europe, so we are giving ourselves a little bit wider range of outcomes for this year. But we feel that between low and mid should be a reasonable outcome for the year. Derik De Bruin : Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open. Doug Schenkel : Hey, good morning guys and thank you for taking my questions. My first one is regarding your long-term organic revenue growth target of 4% to 6%. You clearly grew well above that in 2018, market was helpful. You walked through how the three pillars of your growth strategy are playing out successfully. That being said, I was wondering if you would be willing to maybe breakout how much of the strength in 2018 was better than normal end markets versus your portfolio evolution versus your strong execution? If it's possible to answer that, I think it would help us. We try to assess the sustainability of you generating growth in the higher end of the long-term growth range and the possibility that you might increase the range at some point in the future? Marc N. Casper: Yes. So, Doug thanks for the questions and good morning. As you know in our long-term model, what we\u2019ve assumed is 3% to 5% market growth and to grow at least a point faster than the market. That\u2019s sort of the high-level assumption. When I look at 2018 performance, the market was clearly strong. And we accelerated our share gain meaningfully during the course of the year, right? So that was a fantastic execution by the team. When I think about the actions we\u2019ve taken and one of the things we said at the May Analyst Meeting is as we've invested more and more in the business as we have taken life technologies from a low single-digit growth business to a mid to high as we really driven the synergies on the revenue for FTI, as you see the things we're doing within the Patheon acquisition, a year and half after the close, you get a sense that we're driving to the higher portion of our long-term guidance, because we\u2019ve changed the mix of the company through adding a ton of value to the businesses we\u2019ve acquired and strengthening the businesses that we\u2019ve owned historically. So the 5% starting point for the year is actually the start -- the strongest starting point that Stephen and I could remember in our many years of the company. So we're very bullish about the outlook and we will think about the longer-term model back in May when we look forward to seeing everybody in New York and we'll figure out what the right posture is at that point. Doug Schenkel : Okay. That's helpful and those last couple remarks are a good segue to my second topic, which is really just making sure or clear on guidance logic and guidance philosophy. Again, Europe against an impressive, but still very difficult 8% core revenue growth comparison heading into 2019. That said, you are up against the tough comp in the last couple of quarters including 7.8% in Q4 17, you grew 9% in the third quarter of this year, another 8% I think plus in the fourth quarter. And if I look at the 2-year stacked average growth rates over the past year and then look at what is implied in your guidance for 2019, one would have to assume that the stack [ph] growth rate actually moderates in '19 to get down to around 5% core growth in '19. You certainly haven't said anything that suggests that things are slowing in any geography or end market. I just want to make sure it's fair to conclude that the biases to the upside if underlying end markets and geographic trends continue, and that you continue to execute the way you have over the last several years. Again, everything sounds great. I just want to make sure we\u2019re not missing anything and that guidance is really just the function of the comp and the fact that it's still January? Marc N. Casper: Yes. So very thoughtful. As I think about the year, what is assumed in our initial guidance is that GDP growth will be a bit slower in 2019 versus 2018, because you have uncertainties associated with things like Brexit and trade wars, right? So that's underlying the assumption to start. When you look at the fundamentals of our business, we are not seeing a slowdown in the momentum, right? So the guidance contemplates that the world could get more challenging, but you actually look at what's within our actual order book and sort of customer pipeline, it's very strong. So that's how we\u2019re thinking about the year and as Stephen has said a couple of times during the course of last year, if the market conditions stay as we have enjoyed over the last year and a half, this will be -- if last year was fantastic, this will be spectacularly fantastic, I don\u2019t know. But it'll be just an outstanding year and this guidance allows us to deal with a bit slower GDP growth if that happens. Stephen Williamson : Yes, Doug, [indiscernible] phasing of organic growth kind of expectation for the year as I described in my prepared remarks. Doug Schenkel : That\u2019s great. Very helpful, guys. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Good morning. I was hoping you can elaborate on the outlook per FTI this year across the various customer classes and what your outlook assumes for overall growth in that business? Marc N. Casper: Yes. So, Jack, thanks for the question. So our electron microscopy business had another outstanding year. And when you look at how we've added value to that business, as a reminder, those are low single-digit growth business prior to the acquisition. And we have really accelerated the growth of material sciences, because of the strength of the combination of the portfolio. Our PPI Business System has made their factories more competitive, has improved the lead times and actually has spurred additional demand. And the adoption of Cryo-Electron Microscopy in the life sciences application has been very strong and in fact the Glacios product that we launched started shipping in 2018 also has contributed to the growth. When you look to the outlook for the business, our assumption is that our industrial and applied end market will have a bit of a slower growth because of difficult comparisons, particularly in the second half of the year. We\u2019ve good visibility of about six months in our electron microscopy business and it looks good. But we know we have a difficult comparison in the second half of the year, given the strength of that business and we're assuming that the growth will moderate because of that and obviously as the quarters unfold we will know whether that assumption was spot on or not. Jack Meehan : Thanks. Then as a follow-up, I was hoping you could weigh in on the Specialty Diagnostics margin and the implications for growth. I think it's been a few quarters you\u2019ve talked about the strategic investments and mix there or so, as we turn to 2019 do you think we can start to see margins moderate and expand and maybe talk about Cascadion and where some of those other strategic investments, how those are expected to ramp in terms of contribution? Marc N. Casper: Yes, I will talk about growth and then Stephen to talk about -- a little about the margin side of the equation. Nice to see the mid single-digit growth. Steve has done a nice job of capitalizing on opportunities. We are -- we launched our Cascadion product in Europe on a very limited release, so we could get hands-on customer feedback. And the R&D teams are working on menu expansion. Our assumption is that a minor revenue contributor in 2019, but ramping over time and we're excited about the longer-term there. So, Stephen, you want to talk about margin? Stephen Williamson : Yes, in terms of margin share, we\u2019re investing -- so clearly investing ahead of the Cascadion launch, another commercialization, making investments in regulatory infrastructure across the globe and also making some good health care economics investments to make sure that we can -- all these are tied to continuing the growth profile for this segment. So I think about this investments going forward, we will continue to invest appropriately, but this will be one of the businesses with lower margin expectation -- expansion expectations versus the other three. Jack Meehan : Understood. Thank you, guys. Marc N. Casper: Thanks, Jack. Operator : Next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steve Beuchaw : Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for the time here. Just a couple of things that have been touched on in the Q&A already that I would like to press on in a little bit more detailed way. When I think about the relative performance of Thermo -- and I\u2019m sorry to bring up a point -- brought up a number of times before, but what really sticks on of course is that the trajectory of market share gains is less about the end markets I think. So my question is, as you look at the portfolio and you think about '19 relative to '18 and '17, is there any reason why the trajectory of share gains maybe most acutely informative -- certainly feel free to correct me on that, is basically stable or maybe even better. Just be helpful to hear how you think about the incremental growth embedded in the plan from share gains? Marc N. Casper: Yes, Steve, thanks for the question. So when I think about share gain, it's very broad-based across the company, right? And I could think about it from a few different lenses, right? If you think about it geographically, China has been a real area of our share gain relative to the market growth. If you look at it by end market, as you said Pharma and Biotech, clearly we are growing much faster than the competition. And when you look at it by product line, it's a very broad-based, but you see it clearly in our biosciences business, our mass spectrometry business or chromatography business or bio production business, or electron microscopy business, all grew meaningfully faster than the others. I\u2019m sorry forgot a few others, but it gives you a sense that we have very strong share gain. As I think about what's embedded in our outlook, the minimum goal that we have is at least 1% growth faster than the market, and we obviously did meaningfully better than that in 2018 and our teams are very excited about the prospects for 2019 and they\u2019re going to go out and execute the best they possibly can and drive a very good year for us. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. Thank you for that. And then just one -- sorry, it's a little bit of a fine point, but I wonder if you could peel back the layer of the onion a little bit more on the traction that you're seeing with some of the new Phadia launches. It seem like that\u2019s been one of the most important drivers of the top line acceleration [indiscernible] in the second half of '18. Can you give us a sense for the sustainability of the incremental growth there? Do you think that is share gain or is it more likely that that\u2019s a refresh cycle with existing Phadia customers? How do you think about that? And then I will jump back in queue. Thanks again. Marc N. Casper: Thanks, Steve. So our allergy business and autoimmunity business had a nice share, good growth. And really, we are a very large percentage of the market. So it's really as we expand our menu and as we help, do the health care economics about the importance of allergy testing, particularly around asthma and all of the effects of asthma that's really what drives the -- drives the growth of that business, expands the market. In the U.S., we\u2019ve -- we enjoyed good growth and that really is migrating from skin protesting to blood based testing, and so we when we think about the business really is all about market expansion and the benefits the patients get from having allergy test. So that\u2019s how we thought about it and the business is doing well and the outlook is very positive for that business as well. Steve Beuchaw : Thanks again. Marc N. Casper: You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Next question comes from Patrick Donnelly, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Thanks. Good morning. Marc, maybe just can you talk through the outlook in Europe. Obviously, the macro data there is signaling lower growth. You have that layered on with potential shocks of the system like Brexit, given typically political instability tends to disrupt areas like government spending as you\u2019ve touched on. So it would be helpful just to hear your prospective outlook there for the different segments? Marc N. Casper: Yes. So, Patrick, thanks for the question. So embedded in our guidance is for Europe for the year is low single-digit to mid single-digit growth. It is what we're assuming within 5% organic growth for the year. When you look at the -- by the segments, we're assuming that academic and government will be a little bit weaker embedded in the guidance versus 2018. At the same point, Horizon 2020 funding looks good and I had the opportunity last week to meet with a couple of the ministers in the U.K government and their commitment to preserving the important life sciences heritage that exists in that country is very strong. So, I think the actions of the governments are taking actually reinforce a reasonable outlook for academic and government, but just given the potential for economic growth to mute -- be a little bit more muted. We are assuming that there's a little bit more pressure there, so we will see how that plays out. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. Makes sense. And maybe just one on the bioprocessing market, given healthy results from you guys, competitors earlier this week, that market clearly seems like it's still pointing up. Can you just talk through the durability of the growth there, drivers that give you confidence in the continued strong growth driving that biopharma segment and then is that were the most upside the guidance is? Marc N. Casper: So in terms of bioprocessing, we had a very strong year and as you\u2019ve seen more and more of the molecules have gone from small molecule to large molecule and that really bodes well for the bioprocessing business. And as a reminder, of the four main segments of the activity that exist in bioprocessing, we are the market leader in two, which is [indiscernible] and in single use technologies. And as you know we don\u2019t play in a very large way in purification or filtration. So we are enjoying strong growth because of our strength of the position and good market conditions. When I think about the outlook, I would say we feel good about the assumptions of high single-digit growth for Pharma and Biotech in aggregate. And we will work hard to continue to drive to the highest possible growth in that end market. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is open. Daniel Arias : Good morning, guys. Thank you. Stephen, maybe just extending the thought on the margin commentary, last quarter you called out the EPS impact from the strategic investments for 2018. Is there a number associated with those types of things for 2019, if we were just sort of trying to track how much of the top line step up that you're seeing is coming back into the business? Stephen Williamson : I guess, when I think about Q3 and Q4 step up investments we did, that was approximately just over $30 million of more investments. I think about the whole year next year where its 60 basis points of expansion and that includes the right level of strategic investments across all of the businesses. So it's hard to study separately. There's 30 -- about $30 million step up was [indiscernible] kind of the end of the year additional spending in investment level. Now are kind of more of a -- more normal run rate tied to the [indiscernible] organic growth. So I don\u2019t give specific numbers on the strategic investments in each of the businesses or in total, but it's going to be an appropriate level of spending given the top line growth that we\u2019re expecting for the year. Daniel Arias : Okay. Thank you. And then maybe, Marc, on the tariffs in the manufacturing option that you have is offset just in terms of shifting production around. I\u2019m just curious have you had to do that in a meaningful way at this point or is that just sort of part of the contingency plans if things escalate further? Thanks. Marc N. Casper: So in terms of the tariffs, we've taken some incremental pricing actions, we've taken some incremental sourcing actions, and we have the plans in place to address supply chain if the tariffs really remain permanent. So we know what we would do, but we haven't done a lot of that at this point because it takes a bunch of activity, which we easily can do. But I don't want to do it and then have them move it back or its kind of the way. So we're kind of weighing and seeing a little bit to figure out what the landscape will be on those particular actions. Operator, we have time for just one more. Operator : And your last question comes from Daniel Brennan with UBS. Your line is open. Daniel Brennan : Thank you. Thanks for the question. Congrats on the quarter. So, Marc, I was hoping on China, can you just let us know what did actually grow in the quarter? What assumed in for '19 and maybe specifically for your biopharma business there. As we understand it, the countries are [indiscernible] transition from a generic orientation towards the therapeutic focus. So how is your biopharma business doing today in the outlook? Marc N. Casper: Yes. So we had a very strong quarter. It was -- I think it was something on 19% -- 19%, 19.5% something like that for the quarter, 20% for the year. We're assuming mid-teens growth. This was embedded in the 5% guidance. Feel like that\u2019s a reasonable assumption at the starting point. If I think back over history, we've had different levels. I think mid-teens will be one of the more bullish starting points that we had in the year. Remember, we had double-digit in the past and others, but we feel good about the outlook for the share. Daniel Brennan : And in terms of your biopharma business there, Marc? Marc N. Casper: [Multiple speakers] really good. If you go five years ago, there was very little other than Chinese traditional medicine. And it's been extremely robust given the emergence of innovative drugs and medicines coming out of the country. So we\u2019ve had really good growth there and that also adds sustainability to that market. So let me wrap up the call. It's been a fantastic year. But I\u2019ve to say we are more excited about the opportunities ahead. We look forward to updating you over the course of 2019. And as always thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks everyone. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our Q1 call. As you saw in our press release, we had a strong start to the year. We delivered another quarter of excellent growth on both the top and bottom line. We continue to effectively execute our growth strategy to put Thermo Fisher in the strongest position to serve our customers. We launched a number of innovative new products, capitalized on our leadership in high-growth and emerging markets and strengthened our unique customer value proposition. We also continue to effectively deploy our capital, announcing our acquisition of Brammer Bio and returning capital to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. I'll cover each of these topics in more depth in my remarks, but first, let me recap the financials.  We delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving a 12% increase to $2.81 per share. Our revenue in Q1 grew 5% year-over-year to $6.12 billion. Our adjusted operating income for the first quarter increased 7% to $1.37 billion, and we increased our adjusted operating margin in Q1 to 22.4%. So our team executed well to effectively meet the needs of our customers and carry our strong growth momentum into 2019.  The strong conditions we've been seeing in our end markets for some time continued in Q1, and we captured the opportunities we had to drive growth and gain share. From a geographic perspective, we saw good growth across all of our major regions.  Let me provide you with some color on our performance by end market. Starting with pharma and biotech. This end market remained very strong, and we delivered double-digit growth during the quarter. We continue to see broad-based strength in our businesses that serve these customers. As you know, we have a unique customer value proposition for pharma and biotech because we can help them to accelerate innovation and enhance productivity across their business.  In academic and government, we had low single-digit growth in Q1. Looking at this end market from a geographic lens, we delivered another strong quarter in China, saw good conditions in North America and more muted conditions in Europe.  Turning to diagnostics and health care. We delivered mid-single digits during this quarter with strong contributions from our clinical diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses.  Finally, in industrial and applied, we delivered a high single-digit growth in Q1. Our performance this year was led by strong -- by strength across our Analytical Instrument businesses. To summarize our performance, it was a great quarter. Our teams capitalized on the good conditions in our end markets, and we continued to gain market share.  You can clearly see the impact of our growth strategy in our results. Now let me touch on some of our business highlights in the quarter. As you know, our strategy is based on 3 pillars : launching innovative new products, leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets and continuing to enhance our customer value proposition. This is our formula for success, and we continue to execute well to create a clear competitive advantage with our customers. I'll start with innovation and as you've come to expect from us, we kicked off the year with a range of great new product launches. Let me take a moment to highlight just a few.  In Analytical Instruments, we showcased a number of new products at Pittcon last month under our Thermo Scientific brand. In molecular spectroscopy, we launched our Nicolet Summit FTIR spectrometer, which is designed for QA/QC and teaching laboratories that perform high-volume materials characterization. The Nicolet Summit reduces analysis time and provides real-time feedback on sample quality to optimize customer productivity. And in chromatography and mass spectroscopy, to enable safety in food and animal feed, we introduced a new dioxin analyzer workflow that incorporates our triple quad TSQ 9000 GC mass spec system to enable customers to detect dioxins at the lower levels now required by European Union regulations.  At a major trade show in Shanghai, we unveiled the Thermo Scientific Helios 5 DualBeam, our latest and most advanced focused ion beam scanning electron microscope to date. This new system is designed for materials characterization and analysis at the nanoscale. It sets the industry standard by helping customers develop new products using complex advanced materials. Last, in Specialty Diagnostics, we received FDA clearance for a new ImmunoCAP test for peanut allergies. This blood test is designed to help doctors better identify which patients may be highly sensitive to a certain protein in peanuts that can cause severe allergic reactions. This can be a game changer for patients in terms of appropriately managing their allergy and preventing a life-threatening event.  Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy. Our continued strong performance in high-growth and emerging markets reflects how well we're leveraging our scale to create an outstanding experience for these customers. Building off of our significant growth in 2018, our China business continues to be strong, delivering another quarter of better than 20% growth. I was in Asia earlier this month, and there's a lot of enthusiasm from our colleagues and our customers about the opportunities ahead. In China specifically, we continue to see broad-based growth across our end markets. We're providing technologies to advance precision medicine, enable the flourishing biotech industry and reduce air pollution to give you a few examples.  And we continue to build on our industry-leading scale across the Asia Pacific region to meet customer demand and strengthen our competitive advantage. For example, in Beijing and Delhi, we opened new Customer Solution Centers to help scientists in the food and beverage industry develop advanced analytical workflows that improve quality and safety. These new facilities are strategically placed to help scientists, partners and regulatory agencies collaborate more effectively.  In Singapore, I took part in the ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate our most recent expansion there. This is a great example of how we continue to scale our instrument manufacturing operations to more efficiently deliver products to our customers globally and meet growing demand. Clearly, a lot of opportunity in the high-growth and emerging markets, and we continue to execute well to consistently deliver strong performance. Turning to the third pillar of our growth strategy : our customer value proposition. We continue to increase our capabilities and leverage them across the company to help our customers meet their goals.  A great example is pharma and biotech, which as you know, is our largest and fastest-growing end market. We have industry-leading scale, depth and access that differentiates us in serving these customers. Importantly, we continue to build on our position to be an even stronger partner for them at every stage, from research to drug development to commercial manufacturing. One of the more significant highlights in the quarter was our agreement to acquire Brammer Bio for $1.7 billion. Brammer Bio is a leader in viral vector manufacturing, helping pharma and biotech customers provide breakthrough gene and cell therapies to patients with rare diseases.  As you know, these novel therapies involve altering the genes inside a patient's cells to treat or cure disease. Modified genes usually have to be delivered using a viral vector because they can effectively carry the genetic material into the cell. Brammer Bio has a unique position supporting gene cell therapies because it has expertise in a number of different virus types. Their capabilities cover viral vectors used in a majority of gene therapy clinical trials. These therapies hold great promise for patients who are battling diseases like hemophilia, ALS and Parkinson's.  This is why the market is so exciting and growing at a rate of better than 25% annually. Brammer Bio expands our CDMO capabilities and will be part of our pharma services business after the close. It also complements our leading biosciences and bioproduction portfolios serving the gene therapy market. Given our scale, depth of capabilities and customer reach, we believe we can meaningfully contribute to helping our customers launch new breakthrough therapies. For example, we provide regulatory expertise to accelerate bringing these drugs to markets and experience in building and expanding capacity with world-class quality systems. This gives our customers the confidence to outsource their critical development and manufacturing activities to Thermo Fisher. We're excited about the opportunities this combination represents for our company, our customers and, of course, the patients who benefit. It's another example of our disciplined M&A strategy at work, and we look forward to closing the transaction this quarter. One final comment regarding pharma services. Last month, we announced a $150 million investment to build additional capacity and capabilities at our sites in Monza and Ferentino, Italy and Greenville, North Carolina. This investment will further expand our global sterile manufacturing network. These projects are part of our strategy of deploying CapEx in this business to meet increasing demand from our customers who rely on our biologics, development and manufacturing expertise.  In summary, we're very pleased with these -- with the progress we're making in building our pharma services capabilities. The integration work is essentially behind us. The business is benefiting tremendously from our PPI Business System, and we're hearing incredibly positive feedback from our customers. We're building on our strong foundation by expanding capacity and capabilities through a combination of capital investments and M&A. And finally, most importantly, the business is performing very well.  On that note, let me give you a quick summary of our capital deployment activities so far this year. As I just mentioned, we announced our acquisition of Brammer Bio for $1.7 billion in cash. We also returned significant capital to our shareholders during the quarter. We repurchased $750 million of our stock in January and also increased our dividend by 12%. So an active start to the year on the capital deployment front, and our M&A pipeline remains very robust.  Let me now turn to our guidance for 2019. As you saw in our press release, we are raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. This primarily reflects our strong operational performance in Q1 and the acquisition of Brammer Bio, which as I mentioned, we expect to close in Q2. Stephen will get into the assumptions behind our guidance, but let me cover the highlights.  We're raising our revenue guidance to a new range of $25.17 billion to $25.47 billion, which will represent 3% to 5% growth over 2018. In terms of our adjusted EPS, we're raising our guidance to a new range of $12.08 to $12.22 per share, which will lead to 9% to 10% growth year-over-year. Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize our key takeaways from Q1. We delivered another excellent quarter of financial performance on both the top and bottom line. We continue to execute our proven growth strategy to be an even stronger partner for our customers and gain share. We effectively deployed our capital to create significant value for our customers and our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our first quarter results for the total company then provide color on our four business segments, and I'll conclude by providing our updated 2019 guidance. Before I get into the details of our financial performance, let me provide a high-level view of how the first quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call in January.  As you saw in our press release, we delivered a very strong quarter with 7% organic growth in Q1. This was driven by continued strong market conditions and share gains enabled by great operational execution. We delivered adjusted EPS that was $0.08 higher than we'd assumed at the midpoint of our previous guidance. This is driven by $0.04 in operational performance, $0.03 benefit of quarterly phasing of tax planning initiatives and $0.01 from less adverse FX in the quarter versus our original guidance. So we're off to a great start to the year.  Now let me cover more detail on Q1, starting with earnings per share. This quarter, we grew adjusted EPS by 12% to $2.81. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $2.02, up 41% from Q1 last year.  On the top line, our reported revenue grew 5% year-over-year. The components of our Q1 reported revenue increase included 7% organic growth, 1% growth from acquisitions and foreign exchange headwind of 3%.  Looking at growth by geography. Our markets remain strong across the globe. North America and Europe both grew in the mid-single digits. Asia Pacific and rest of the world both grew in the double digits. And we had another great quarter in China, growing over 20%.  Turning to our operational performance. Q1 adjusted operating income increased 7%, and adjusted operating margin was 22.4%, up 40 basis points from Q1 of last year. We saw strong productivity from our PPI Business System and good volume leverage, partially offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. Foreign exchange was a headwind of just over 3% on our operating income growth in the quarter and negatively impacted margins by 10 basis points.  Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in Q1 was 46.3%, flat to Q1 last year. In the quarter, strong productivity and volume pull-through was offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investment. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 19.9% of revenue, which is down 50 basis points versus Q1 2018, driven by a strong top line growth and productivity actions. Total R&D expense came in at 4% of revenue, flat compared to Q1 last year as we continue to reinvest in our businesses. And R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q1 was 6.7%.  Looking at our results below the line for the quarter. Net interest expense was $122 million, down approximately $20 million from Q1 last year, driven primarily by debt reduction. Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of $12 million, higher than Q1 2018, primarily due to changes in nonoperating foreign exchange. Our Q1 adjusted tax rate was 10.1%, which is 130 basis points lower than Q1 2018, driven primarily by the impact of our tax planning initiatives tied to U.S. tax reform. Q1 average diluted shares were 403 million, which is 3 million lower year-over-year, mainly as a result of our share buybacks partially offset by option dilution.  Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations in Q1 was $650 million, and free cash flow was $455 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $195 million. We ended the quarter with $1.1 million in cash and investments. And in terms of capital deployment, as Marc said, Q1 was an active quarter. We continue to return capital to shareholders with $750 million of share buybacks in January. And in February, we announced a 12% increase in our dividend. We were also active with M&A, committing $1.7 billion for the acquisition of Brammer Bio. So over $2.5 billion of capital deployment actions were taken in the first quarter.  Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $18.1 billion, down $840 million sequentially from Q4. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.9x total debt to adjusted EBITDA. To wrap up my comments on our total company performance. We continue to increase ROIC, which is now at 11.1%, up 100 basis points from Q1 last year.  I'll now provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. Starting with Life Science Solutions. In Q1, reported revenue in this segment increased 7%, and organic revenue growth was 8%. In the quarter, we continue to see very good growth in this segment, led by our bioproduction, biosciences and clinical next-gen sequencing businesses. Q1 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions increased 8%, and adjusted operating margin was 34.9%, up 40 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull-through and good productivity, which is partially offset by strategic investments, unfavorable business mix and the headwind from foreign exchange. In the Analytical Instruments Segment, reported revenue increased 5% in Q1 and organic revenue growth was 8%. In the quarter, we continue to see very good growth across all of our businesses in this segment. Q1 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments grew 15%, and adjusted operating margin was 21.3%, up 170 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw very strong volume leverage and productivity and a favorable impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix.  Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics Segment. In Q1, total revenue grew 1%, and organic revenue growth was 4%. In the segment, growth in this segment was led by our clinical diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income was flat versus prior year, and adjusted operating margin were over 25.3%, down 30 basis points from the prior year. In the quarter, we saw good volume leverage and favorable business mix. However, this was more than offset by strategic investments.  Finally, in Laboratory Products and Services Segment, Q1 reported revenue increased 4%. Organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter, we saw a strong growth across all of the businesses in the segment, which includes our pharma services, lab products and research channels businesses. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 2%, and adjusted operating margin was 11.3%, which is 30 basis points lower than the prior year. In the quarter, we saw strong productivity and good volume leverage. This was more than offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix.  So now I'd like to move on to our updated full year 2019 guidance. As you saw in our press release and as Marc mentioned earlier, we are raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. Let me walk you through the details. I'll begin with revenue. We're raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $240 million and tightening the range by $100 million. The $240 million increase to the midpoint consist of 2 elements. First, $100 million increase in our organic growth outlook for the year to reflect on strong Q1 performance. As a reminder, our initial guidance for the year assumes 5% organic growth in 2019. We're raising that guidance to reflect a strong Q1 performance, and we now expect full year 2019 organic growth to be between 5% and 6%. The second element of the increase in our revenue guidance is an addition of $140 million to reflect the acquisition of Brammer Bio, which we expect to close during Q2.  Turning to adjusted earnings per share. We're increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 and tightening the range by $0.06. The $0.05 increase to the midpoint consists of 3 elements : a $0.04 increase to reflect our strong Q1 operational performance, a $0.04 increased to reflect the addition of Brammer Bio, and a $0.03 reduction to account for more adverse FX environment versus our previous guidance. To sum this up, our 2019 revenue guidance is now a range of $25.17 billion to $25.47 billion, which would represent 3% to 5% growth versus 2018. And our updated adjusted EPS guidance for 2019 is now a range of $12.08 to $12.22, which would represent growth of 9% to 10% versus 2018.  A few other details behind the revised 2019 guidance, starting with FX. Currency rates continue to change in Q1. The mix of the FX rate changes have no net impact on revenue, so we continue to assume that FX will be a headwind on the full year revenue of approximately $400 million, or 1.6%. However, the mix of FX rate changes did impact the pull-through, and we now expect FX to be a headwind to adjusted EPS of $0.24 or 2.2% for the full year. The guidance continues to incorporate $0.10 of net dilution for the pending divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business, which we announced in January. I want to note that with the exception of the Anatomical Pathology business divestiture and the Brammer Bio acquisition, both of which are expected to close in Q2, our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures.  We're assuming there's no change in the trade tariff environment in 2019 versus our previous guidance. As I mentioned last quarter, our guidance includes a year-over-year headwind from tariffs of about $30 million or approximately $0.07 to adjusted EPS to reflect the full annualized growth impact of the tariffs that are currently in place. Adjusted operating margin is now expected to be between 23.6% and 23.7%, which would result in margin expansion of 50 to 60 basis points for the year.  Moving below the line. We're continuing to assume $1.25 billion of debt repayments in 2019, and we expect net interest expense to be about $470 million. This is approximately $10 million lower than our previous guidance. Presuming that other net income will be about $25 million, which is $5 million higher than our previous guidance, we continue to expect the 2019 adjusted tax rate to be 11%. As I mentioned earlier, due to the timing of discrete tax planning items within the year, we had a lowered rate in Q1 at 10.1%, and we expect the rate in the remaining quarters to be closer to 11.3% and no change to the full year.  We're now assuming net capital expenditures to be between $925 million and $975 million for the year. This is $125 million higher than our previous guidance to factor in the expected facility expansion investments that will be made in Brammer Bio. We expect to offset the Brammer CapEx investment with strong operational cash flow performance. And as a result, our free cash flow estimate for the full year continues to be approximately $4.1 billion. We assume we'll return approximately $300 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, no change from previous guidance. And we estimate that the full year average diluted shares will be approximately 404 million, an increase of 1 million from our prior guidance.  And finally, a few comments on quarterly phasing for the year. Our expectation for the level of organic revenue growth in Q2, Q3 and Q4 is unchanged from our prior guidance. In terms of adjusted EPS, for the remaining 9 months of the year, we expect that it'll be phased across those 9 months in a similar way to the same period in 2018. So in summary, we started the year with an excellent Q1, and we're in a great position to achieve our goals for the year.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth Apicerno : Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Ross Muken : Congrats. So coming off of some peer commentary yesterday, to see your China business up, obviously, a pretty remarkable sort of print. I guess, as you think about sort of the moving parts in China, obviously, we know about the huge push right now on the innovative biotech side. But obviously, we're seeing some peers call out generics and food and some of the other areas. It seemed like based on your mix, much of your end markets, maybe ex academic, were strong. And I don't know if that holds true for China. So maybe a little bit of sector commentary on China would be helpful to start, because obviously, this has been a -- just a remarkable run you had, where that business has put up 20% now for quite some time. Marc Casper : Ross, thank you for the question. So I was in China in early April. I spent some time with our team, government and customers. We had a very good quarter. We had bookings that were stronger than revenue, and it was broad-based in terms of the momentum. So we really didn't see any headwinds in the Chinese end markets. So we had a good quarter in the academic and government sector. Industrial was fine. Pharma and biotech was fine, and we had smaller exposure in that market, to diagnostics and health care, but that was also okay, too. So we didn't see any challenges, and the teams got a lot of momentum and super excited for the future. I have to say, spending some time with some of the biotech customers in the market, the growth there looks like it's going to have very long -- a long cycle ahead of us, a very positive environment. Ross Muken : Helpful. And maybe quickly on Brammer. Obviously, not a huge revenue base comparative to your overall, but a super exciting business. You sort of bring unique capabilities to that market. Maybe just give us a bit of a feel in general about how you think sort of the gene therapy and sort of the bioproduction side of that is going to evolve. And how you guys could theoretically, over time, kind of help with some of the logistical and manufacturing challenges that, that market currently faces? Marc Casper : Ross, the gene therapy area is one that our customers broadly are very excited about, investing significantly and have been asking us for help. We already have a reasonable exposure with our biosciences and bioproduction business in serving that customer base. And one of the things that we consistently heard was the need to have the right development partners. And we looked at the landscape and Brammer as the industry leader and the very broad set of capabilities they have in viral vectors gave us the confidence and that's the right platform to build off of.  The interesting thing is, the big opportunity in gene therapy is actually going through the whole ramping-up process, where regulatory expertise and scaling the production is new to that segment and something we have quite a bit of experience base across our pharma services business. So we're going to use our regulatory expertise. We're very excited about serving the industry with an exquisite set of capabilities. So we look forward to closing that acquisition this quarter. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Marc, I apologize. I'm going to ask another question on Brammer. You've got a couple of early customers here with Sarepta, Voyager and Sangamo. Just curious as we think about customer diversification over time, how you think about the pipeline. If you're willing to comment on how much the $250 million in revenue this year is already contracted?  And then we've heard from some of your peers in that space that you can actually charge fees on capacity that's reserved but not used. So I'm curious about whether pricing opportunities in that space may be a little bit different than we see with some of the other manufacturing businesses. And then lastly, if you could just talk about the EBITDA margin potential for that business? I know it's low 20s. I think some of the pure businesses are kind of high 20s with mid-30s target. So just curious how you think about the margin opportunity to come. Marc Casper : Yes. So Tycho, in terms of the customer mix, there's a number of customers, a few have been publicly announced by Brammer over the years and others are confidential. So that's a good mix of customers. And even within the customers, there's a good mix of programs. So you have diversification. Because not every program is going to be successful, ultimately, so it has a nice mix.  The interesting thing is because of the capacity expansion that we're excited about and the customer relationships we have, that's going to diversify that base of customers further over time. So that's very good. Yes, because there is pricing -- the pricing in the short term in this market is attractive because there's a real shortage of capacity. So there are -- many contracts have reservation fees associated with it, and that helps with the industry economics. But as the industry scales, you get the economic benefits from the scale leverage. And therefore, as capacity comes online, the economics improve further because of scale. And then finally, in terms of our outlook. For this, margins are a little below the company average right now and where we see significant opportunity to be accretive to our margins over time. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then maybe just as a follow up. Sticking with the biomanufacturing piece, obviously, you announced the Patheon capacity expansion there as well. Has your view on Patheon revenue synergies changed at all? And how is the Advanced Bioprocessing acquisition kind of fitting into that part of the equation? Marc Casper : Yes. So Advanced Bioprocessing, we closed in October. That was a bolt-on acquisition within our bioproduction business on the product side. This is off to a really good start. Revenue's been good. Earnings are good. And Stephen, I'd say, I think in January, it's $0.04 to $0.05 of accretion this year. So that's really going quite well.  In terms of the -- within our own network within bioproduction -- the biologics portion, we continue to expand the network because the demand is very, very strong. The Celltrion capacity expansions that we just announced is based on the fact that we have customers that have expressed interest for utilizing that capacity as it comes on line. So we're off to a good start. And from a revenue synergy perspective, it's going well. And ultimately, we see the business, which historically was kind of a mid- to high single-digit growth business, we'll transition into that business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Doug Schenkel : So Marc, just a quick follow-up on China. You entered the year assuming China would grow mid-teens. I think that was the assumption embedded into guidance. You grew north of 20% in the first quarter. Should we now expect better than mid-teens growth for China for the full year? Or should we still be maintaining the same assumption given comps do get a bit more difficult over the balance of the year? Marc Casper : Yes. So the way we did the outlook for the year as a whole, Doug, is we banked the operational performance in Q1 over -- that was higher than the guidance, both on revenue and operationally. And assumed that the remaining 3 quarters were as we had guided originally back in January. So actually, haven't done the math on the -- China in my head, but we assumed mid-teens-type growth for the year. We, obviously, did over 20% in Q1. So that's going to take it to probably strong mid-teens to low high teens. I haven't done the math, but we haven't change the outlook for the next three quarters relative to our January guidance. Doug Schenkel : Okay, that's helpful. On the capital deployment side, by our estimates, you still have more than $10 billion of M&A capacity over the next year, and that's factoring in Brammer and that's just with cash. If you take in the possibility of using equity, your capacity likely doubles by our math. How are you thinking about the M&A criteria today given where valuations are? And given most of your recent acquisitions, including Patheon, Brammer and Advanced Bioprocessing were all in the CDMO or bioprocessing market, I'm just wondering whether that means it's more likely you're going to do more of these, especially given the fragmentation and rapid growth of the CDMO market. Or if there's actually a prioritization to look in some other areas? Marc Casper : Yes. So we have substantial capacity. The first thing is our #1 priority is to run the business we have and do a great job with it, right? And that's what we do everyday we wake up. And then we have used the same M&A criteria for the last 17, 18 years, which is, will the transaction strengthen the company strategically? Will it be valued by our customers? And ultimately, will it create shareholder value as measured by the returns on invested capital that we have, right? So when I look at the environment, we are an incredibly fragmented industry. Our pipeline is very robust. So we're very active and looking. But we only do the transactions that we feel are really going to be great transactions, right? And so it's very hard to predict which ones will go through, and we're looking across all portfolios. So I wouldn't over read that it's all biologics or bioproduction based. I think part of it is, we took advantage of the opportunity as BD was selling a noncore asset and Brammer, really, was looking for a real boost in expansion capital. So situations led to those transactions, but you'll see us look across the portfolio. And those that are good, we'll do. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Jack Meehan : I was hoping we could turn to the Analytical Instruments Segment. And could you please give us an update on the growth of FEI and just have backlog shaping up across life sciences versus material sciences and semi? Marc Casper : Yes. So in terms of the Analytical Instruments business, all 3 of our businesses had good quarters with strong growth. Material sciences, which includes the electron microscopy and our molecular spectroscopy, had good growth in the quarter. In terms of the segments you have -- the material science segment, which includes semiconductor, batteries, advanced materials and academic research, you also have the life sciences sector, primarily structural biology. Revenue growth was good in both of those sectors. As you know, we are expecting slower growth in the second half because we have more challenging comparisons in the materials science sector -- portion of that product portfolio going forward. So we're expecting, as we originally guided, that the second half will be slower than the growth that we delivered in the first quarter. Jack Meehan : Great. And then, I guess, looking at Europe, you called out some more muted conditions on the academic side there. I was curious regionally what you were seeing. And then I know industrial and applied overall grew high single digits. But was there any change regionally in Europe in those end markets that you saw? Marc Casper : Europe, actually, in aggregate was a good. We had good growth in the quarter. And that really ran across 3 of the 4 end markets, industrial and applied, health care and diagnostics and pharma and biotech. We saw more muted conditions in Europe. So -- and geographically, probably Germany was an area where -- a little bit more muted on the release of funds, but other than that... Kenneth Apicerno : On the academic and government... Marc Casper : On academic and government. So Europe, as a whole was fine, right? It was actually -- it was very solid growth, but I called it out just because academic and government in that region was a little bit softer than we had seen recently. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Daniel Leonard : So first off, appreciate the commentary on margins in the LPS segment. How do you view the trajectory there? And what would put that business back on a margin expansion trajectory? Is that primarily the contract manufacturing business? Stephen Williamson : So Dan, this is Stephen. I'll take that one. So when I think about margins for LPS, yes, expansion in that segment is -- long term, it's going to be driven by the pharma services business. As we outlined in the original guide, we're investing in that businesses where we're preparing for the ramp in growth. It's been driving revenue synergies and putting investments in place on sterile on the biologics side. So more muted this year, but good long-term growth prospects in terms of margin expansion going forward there. Daniel Leonard : Okay. And then my follow-up. Marc, there was a bioprocessing product acquisition that traded away from you this quarter. Can you remind us how you're viewing the opportunities to incrementally expand your offering on the bioprocessing product front? And do you feel yourself -- do you see opportunities in areas where there's reasonable concentration amongst only a few players? Is there an opportunity for Thermo to participate? Marc Casper : Yes, Dan. We have been building our position methodically in the bioproduction business over time. It actually started with the acquisition of Life Technologies, where we went from being a strong player in single-use technologies to becoming a leader in cell culture media. We then have done a series of transactions to strengthen our offering, whether it was ASI, adding the controller technologies from Finesse, acquiring BD's business. So we look on the parts of our portfolio where we can build on our strengths and generate strong returns. We're very disciplined about the return profiles on M&A. So you have to think about that in terms of which opportunities make sense. And we'll continue to look at things, and if we see the right opportunities, you'll see us do more. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Maybe, Marc, just on the industrial, applied market, nice to see you guys be able to put up high single-digit growth against a pretty tough high single-digit comp. Can you just talk about the strength there and the durability going forward? Which pockets you're really seeing some strength? Marc Casper : Yes. So we were expecting a strong start to the year in industrial and applied, because, obviously, there's some visibility from how the year ended within our bookings. So we grew high single-digit growth in the quarter. And that strength, we saw it in chromatography and mass spectrometry. We saw it in chemical analysis, and we saw it in electron microscopy. And what we're assuming is that going in the second half of the year is going to be a little bit softer given the more challenging comparisons. So that's kind of the view on that market. Patrick Donnelly : Okay, and then as we approach the Analyst Day next month, you guys are coming off an 8% growth year, 7% growth quarter here. You have that 4% to 6% long-term guide out there. Can you just help us put that perspective as you kind of plan ahead of the Analyst Day? What your thoughts are in terms of where we are currently versus that long-term growth rate? Marc Casper : Yes. As I was looking at the calendar, and the best day of the year is coming up. It's May 22 in New York City as my team there always smiles. So I can't wait to get in front of each of you and the investment community. And I know that Stephen will be talking about the three year model and our long-term outlook as part of that. So we'll clearly be a good topic of discussion back at that point in time. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan from UBS. Daniel Brennan : Great. Congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to start with biopharma. Obviously, another really robust quarter. Marc, can you just point to whether regionally, were there any big deviations there? And can you maybe point out where the strength came from within your businesses? And then related to that, you cited share gains, so would be interested in some color on kind of where you're seeing the most share gains and the opportunity. Marc Casper : Yes, Dan. Thanks for the question. When I look at the pharma biotech end market, the market is very strong. We grew in the double digits. And when I think about the business lines, we saw strength across really the portfolio. Bioproduction, chroma mass spec, our research and safety channel and our pharma services business all had excellent quarters in terms of growth. So broad-based strength as we have been seeing for quite some time.  Geographically, it was good across the markets. I was looking at that and, we didn't see any anomalies in any of the regions, so very strong geographically. And I think part of it is that science is good, funding is good, but we're clearly gaining share. Our value proposition is truly unique in terms of how we help our customers be more innovative and productive. And we have very incredibly strong commercial reach that gives us access to those customers. And the scale of the relationship gives us unique access to each of the customers as well. So that combination has sustained very strong performance for quite some time. Daniel Brennan : Great. And then may be related to that, Marc, you highlighted in China the excitement over kind of future biotech growth there. Can you just elaborate on that a bit? Is that the push for China to be more therapeutically-oriented or can be branded-oriented? So maybe just some color between what your business looks like today in biopharma in China and what it can look like going forward? Marc Casper : Yes. So five years ago, roughly, when we were thinking about the industry in China from a biotech and pharmaceutical perspective, it was a blend of generic manufacturing on the pharma side and traditional Chinese medicine. Over the last 5 years, there really has been an explosion of growth, interest and new company formation on the biotech side in addition to the small molecule and traditional Chinese medicine, and that continues to look very bright in terms of the outlook. And because many of the customers have worked outside of China, they're very familiar with our capabilities. And the companies that are setting up, they are standardizing on our technologies. It's really an exciting opportunity, and we're doing very well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Ryskin : This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik actually. You touched on Europe previously, but I want to follow up a little bit specifically on Brexit. It doesn't sound like you've seen any impact in the U.K. or in Northern Europe as the negotiations are ongoing. But I just want to see what your thoughts are and what's embedded in the guidance as we move through the year. That's been an area kind of focus recently as a potential cause of concern. So I want to see how you're thinking about that. Marc Casper : Yes. In terms of Brexit, U.K. continues to be -- it's a small market, but the conditions were fine. We did a lot of preparation work really effectively last week. And obviously, that's been kicked down the can for a while. So we're prepared should that happen but it doesn't seem to be flowing in any material way, positively or negatively, towards our business in terms of market conditions. Michael Ryskin : All right. And then a quick follow-up. Could you give us an update on some of the other capital deployment events that are expected in 2Q? The divestment of Anatomical Pathology in terms of timing and then also an update on Gatan. Marc Casper : Sure. So we expect in Q2 to close the divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business. We did clear all of the regulatory events that we need to clear, and now we're just working with the acquirer on all the closing conditions on that contract. We also expect, as Stephen said, to close the Brammer acquisition in Q2. In terms of Gatan, we are, as well as Roper Technologies, have been working with the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority to come to a reasonable resolution, and it's been challenging. We expect to get their final decision by the end of Q2. So that's where we are with Gatan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Stephen Willoughby : A couple of guidance questions for you. First, Stephen, I believe you said that you beat your first quarter expectations at the midpoint by $0.08, but then in the earnings bridge for the full year, you're only attributing $0.04, really to the first quarter beat, so just wondering on that. And then secondly, operating margin were up 40 bps here in the first quarter. You're going against more difficult organic growth comps in the remainder of the year. So we'd expect organic growth to slow. Just wondering, in terms of margin expansion, what gets margin expansion greater with what's believed to be slower organic growth the rest of the year. Stephen Williamson : Yes. So Steve, in terms of the $0.08 in Q1, $0.03 of that was timing of tax, which kind of unwinds each quarter as you go out in Q2 to Q4. That's $0.03 of the difference, and then $0.01 was FX. And the way that rates changed, we actually had a below-the-line FX benefit versus the original guide, which was a positive $0.01 in Q1. And then as we look at the rest of the year, Q3 and 4, it's $0.04 more adverse FX pull-through on the revenue. The net for the year is a $0.03 change for FX. So -- but the $0.04 operational carries forward to the full year. So that's kind of bridges you the $0.08 to the $0.04.  And then on the 40 basis points for the quarter, just as a reminder, that included the headwind from FX and from gross tariffs as well. It's about 20 basis points of headwind that we offset and still delivered the 40 basis points. The tariff headwind declines as we go into the second half of the year, which is -- so that headwind goes away. And then from an FX standpoint, it also lessens from a basis points standpoint and then this really comes down to the scale of revenue in Q4 as sizable. The timing of certain of our projects in terms of spend, that's helps with markets as well. And that gives you an idea of the margin profile for the rest of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sung Ji Nam from BTIG. Sung Ji Nam : Just a couple of quick ones. Marc, could you -- just going back to Gatan, how critical is the asset for your cryo-EM business overall? Is it a nice asset to have? If you could comment on that? And then also Stephen, you talked about some strategic investments for Specialty Diagnostics. And I don't mean to be nitpicking at this point, but given that segment is kind of a laggard in terms of top line growth, was curious as to where there are opportunities to potentially further accelerate growth for that segment. Marc Casper : Yes. So thanks for the question. So first, in terms of Gatan, we think it's a nice fit with our electron microscopy business, and we'll see whether that gets closed or not. We did sign a new long-term supply relationship with Gatan. So if it doesn't close, it has no negative impact on the strategic outlook for the electron microscopy business. So that's a nonfactor. In terms of Specialty Diagnostics, the business is performing well and when I think about the growth in the first quarter, that includes powering through a reasonable level of flu headwind and still delivering solid mid-single-digit growth in the quarter. And we're making good progress on the product development programs that we have, and that should benefit growth in the midterm. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Capital Markets. Paul Knight : Marc, if you look and you see the customers tone and think about organic growth in the industry and the financing that's going on in the industry as well, what's your visibility on the current organic guidance? Do you think it's a multiyear look? Or is it this year's look? What are your thoughts on that? Marc Casper : Yes. So when I look at the outlook for the market, absent a macro recession -- and if I'm looking to see the life science tools and diagnostics fundamentals, they look very strong. You're seeing excitement in pharma and biotech in terms of the science and the investments that support it. You see it in funding going to biotech, you see that looking very good. If you look at the commitments around the world to academic and governments, especially on the academic side globally, there is a big commitments to NIH in the U.S., there's a real excitement in the U.K. about kind of a post-Brexit world, a new Horizon program in Europe, and China continues to have a 5-year plan that gives the outlook there that looks robust. So if you go there, diagnostics and health care continues to have a bright outlook because, really, the only way you can control medical costs is to get accurate diagnosis, so you're spending the right money on things that actually benefit patients. So when you look at the fundamentals, super positive in our industry. And I saw when the recession came out, look at the -- what's going on in our business looks great. We don't see any recessionary factors. But at some point over the next, who knows, 5 years, you never can predict, there'll be some slowdown in economic growth. And the great thing about life science tools and diagnostics is our industry performs great in a recession. It's incredibly low exposure to the volatility that other sectors have. So we're bullish about the outlook in our industry. Paul Knight : And then lastly, Marc, I know your IT infrastructure, your distribution channel of selling product has been one of your great advantages over the last several years. Is your CapEx -- I mean, how do you maintain a barrier and keep that advantage in the market? And specifically, is it requiring more CapEx? Or is the pace of CapEx and investment there the same or not? Marc Casper : Yes. So we create a fantastic e-commerce and e-business experience for our customers. And we have invested substantially historically to build a leading platform that created that advantage. And that we continue to invest to maintain and build our lead, which we are investing at a lower rate than what we had historically because effectively, we have that leading platform. So yes, we continue to add new capabilities. And if you go to our Fisher site or thermofisher.com, you see how strong those experiences are. And we'll continue to invest to make sure that we maintain our own. Kenneth Apicerno : Operator, we're going to end it right there. We're just about out of time. Marc Casper : So let me just wrap up by summarizing that we're off to a strong start. We're on track to deliver another outstanding year. And as always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

So with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our Q2 call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered another excellent quarter. From a financial perspective, we achieved very strong revenue and earnings performance. We made great progress in executing our growth strategy and it was an especially fruitful quarter for innovation, which I\u2019ll cover later in more detail. Last, we continue to effectively execute our capital deployment strategy to strengthen our strategic position. Conditions in our end markets were good and I\u2019m proud of all of the effort our teams put forth to capitalize on those opportunities and gain share. With a great first half behind us, we\u2019re well positioned to continue our momentum and achieve another outstanding year. Let me begin with an overview of our Q2 financial highlights. First, we delivered excellent adjusted EPS growth, achieving an 11% increase to $3.04 per share. Our revenue in Q2 increased to $6.32 billion, growing 4% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income increased 6% to $1.48 billion. And our adjusted operating margin expanded by 40 basis points to 23.5% for the quarter. Before I discuss the quarter in detail, I want to take a moment to provide an update on the data center outage that we referred to in our recent 8-K filing. The outage occurred a few days before quarter end and caused delays in the processing of certain orders and shipments. This resulted in some second quarter activity shifting to the third quarter. The financial impact was not material, and Stephen will provide more detail. Our systems are now back up and running and I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of our teams in keeping our customers front and center as they work to get the issue resolved. It was a great example of our culture of intensity and involvement at work. Now I\u2019ll give you more color on the quarter, starting with an overview of our performance in the context of our end markets. Conditions across our end markets were good and our team continue to position the company well with our customers, capture opportunities to drive growth and gain share. Starting with pharma and biotech; this end market was very strong and we delivered another quarter of double-digit growth. We continue to see strength across all our businesses, serving these customers with excellent momentum in our bioproduction and pharma services businesses. Our unique value proposition is resonating extremely well with our biopharma customers and they see us as a strategic partner to help them accelerate their innovation pipelines, while enhancing productivity across their businesses. In industrial and applied, we delivered low single-digit growth in Q2. Our performance in this end market was driven by strong demand for our chemical analysis and chromatography and mass spectrometry products. Turning to academic and government, growth here was flat in the quarter. Looking at this end market by region, we saw ongoing strength in China and more muted conditions in North America and Europe. Finally in diagnostics and health care, we grew in the low single digits in Q2. We continued our very good growth momentum in our clinical diagnostics and immunodiagnostic businesses and also saw strong demand in our health care market channel. Conditions in this end market were a continuation of what we\u2019ve seen so far this year. So going into the second half of the year, we continue to feel good about our markets and look forward to capitalizing on the many opportunities we have to serve our customers and drive growth. On that note, let me turn to our growth strategy, which as you know, is threefold and consists of; continuously developing high-impact, innovative new products; leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. We made great progress in advancing our strategy in Q2 with many highlights across our businesses. As usual, I\u2019ll touch on just a few examples that bring our strategy to life and demonstrate how we\u2019re continuing to build on our success to put Thermo Fisher in the best position to win with our customers. Beginning with innovation, we released a number of excellent new products across our businesses that reinforce our technology leadership, which is essential to enabling our customers\u2019 key scientific advances. I\u2019ll start with our highlights on the American Society for Mass Spectrometry conference, which as you know, is an important customer event and always a great opportunity for us to reinforce our industry leadership. This was really a milestone year for us at ASMS and we showcased a range of new hardware, software and workflows. Most significant was our introduction of new-generation Thermo Scientific Orbitrap instruments. First, our new Orbitrap Exploris 480 system combines our industry-leading mass spec technology with new intelligence-driven data acquisition techniques. This allows researchers to use mass spectrometry for more rigorous, high-throughput protein identification, quantification and structural analysis in pharmaceutical and translational medicine applications. Second, our Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid system provides academic and government and biopharmaceutical labs with access to a high-performance mass spectrometer that greatly improves sensitivity over previous generations. This new instrument expands the ability to characterize and quantify complex biomolecules and biological systems, enabling scientists to study protein structures at an unprecedented level of detail. We also introduced a new high-resolution mass spec workflow called the Thermo Scientific HR Multi-Attribute Method that simplifies and standardizes biotherapeutic characterization and quality control to accelerate the development of biologics. In our electron microscopy business, we launched the Thermo Scientific MicroED, which is the first electron diffraction solution on the market. By integrating this new detector and automation software into our high-performance transmission electron microscopes, we can now offer customers much greater speed and ease-of-use. Turning to our genetic sciences business, we further strengthened our leading qPCR offering by launching the QuantStudio 6 and 7 Pro Real-Time PCR systems. These smart instruments feature cutting-edge technology, such as voice-activated commands and hand-free operation to significantly improve the user experience. So clearly, many great examples from the quarter that show how we\u2019re continuing, our very long track record of high-impact innovation, and we look forward to building on our momentum as the year unfolds. Turning to the second element of our growth strategy, leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets, we had another strong growth here again \u2013 we had strong growth here again in Q2. Our performance was highlighted by another excellent quarter in China, where we delivered mid-teens growth. We\u2019re effectively leveraging our industry-leading scale in China to create a differentiated experience for our customers. We continue to expand our presence in these markets and we are excited about the new customer experience center we opened in Seoul, South Korea in the quarter. This center showcases our depth of capabilities to the life sciences industry. It serves as a hub for our customers to gain access to our technologies, work with our experts and partner with their industry peers to advance science and technology in Korea. Since our grand opening in May, hundreds of current and potential customers have visited the center. We are confident that this investment will help build strategic partnerships and significantly contribute to new growth opportunities for us in South Korea. The third element of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition and we continually invest to enhance our offering and build on our leading position. Given the leadership we have in serving the pharma and biotech end market, we are very focused on further enhancing the value we can bring to these customers. We\u2019re doing this by expanding our existing capabilities and complementing them with strategic acquisitions. To give you a couple of examples of expansion projects, we\u2019ve continued to increase our bioproduction capabilities to meet robust customer demand. We recently committed $50 million to expand our manufacturing network for our leading single-use technologies. We\u2019ve also announced our plan to establish a new Bioprocessing Collaboration Center at our pharma services site in St. Louis, Missouri. This is a terrific example of how we\u2019re combining our bioproduction technologies with our pharma services capabilities to benefit our customers and drive growth. In terms of acquisitions, we were very pleased to complete our acquisition of Brammer Bio, a leader in viral vector manufacturing for gene and cell therapies. As we discussed in some detail on our analyst meeting in May, Brammer Bio significantly expands our offering in this fast-growing market. It gives us the opportunity to leverage our capabilities in gene therapy across our biosciences, bioproduction and pharma services businesses, and set a new standard for viral vector manufacturing. We welcome nearly 600 new colleagues to Thermo Fisher, and it was terrific to meet many of them during our recent visits to Brammer\u2019s key sites in Massachusetts and Florida. We\u2019re making good progress with the integration and the team is very excited about taking the business they\u2019ve built to the next level as part of Thermo Fisher. In Q2, we also announced our intent to acquire a site in Cork, Ireland from GlaxoSmithKline. With more than 400 employees, the site produces complex Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, or APIs, that are used to treat diseases, including childhood cancers, depression and Parkinson\u2019s. The Cork site will add capacity to our API network to support customer demand. All of these examples reinforce our commitment to strengthening our offering and create added value for our customers and for our shareholders. We also continue to effectively execute our capital deployment strategy. And I\u2019ll give you a quick summary of our activities during the quarter. As I\u2019ve just mentioned, we completed our acquisition of Brammer Bio and we look forward to closing the GSK site by the end of the year. Both acquisitions strengthen our pharma services capabilities. We also acquired HighChem, a small business that expands our mass spectrometry software offering, to help scientists analyze complex data and identify small molecules in a variety of applications. Last, we completed our divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business for $1.14 billion in Q2. This transaction will provide us with additional capital that we can put to work overtime to create shareholder value. With that, I\u2019d like to review our 2019 guidance at a high level. As you saw in our press release, we\u2019re raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year based primarily on our strong operational performance. Stephen will cover the details. But on a high level, we\u2019re raising our revenue guidance to a new range of $25.3 billion to $25.5 billion, which would result in 4% to 5% revenue growth over 2018. In terms of adjusted EPS, we\u2019re raising our guidance to a new range of $12.16 to $12.26, per share, which represents 9% to 10% growth year-over-year. So to summarize our key takeaways from Q2, we executed well to capitalize on the good conditions on our end markets and deliver very strong financial results. We made significant progress in terms of advancing our growth strategy, and we also continue to effectively execute our capital deployment strategy and create value for our customers and our shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As usual, I\u2019ll take you through an overview of our second quarter results for the total company, then provide color on our four business segments. I\u2019ll conclude by providing our updated 2019 guidance. Before I get into details of our financial performance, let me provide a high-level view of how the second quarter played out versus our expectations from the time of our last earnings call in April. As you saw in our press release we delivered a very strong quarter in Q2 with 5% organic growth and an 11% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted EPS was $0.04 higher than we\u2019d assumed at the midpoint of our previous guidance. This was driven equally by four factors : operational performance, the timing of the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business, quarterly phasing of tax planning initiatives and less adverse FX in the quarter. So a very strong performance in Q2. Let me update you on the financial impact of the data center outage. This event delayed shipments for several of our businesses. We estimate that the outage had a negative impact on total company organic growth in Q2 of approximately 1%. Roughly half of that impact was in our Analytical Instruments business with the remainder in Specialty Diagnostics and Lab Products and Services. We see this as a shift in the timing of revenue recognition between Q2 and Q3 of approximately $50 million with no material impact expected for the full year 2019. We have not adjusted the Q2 numbers that we discuss today for this impact, but I thought it would be helpful to give you this context. Now let me cover more detail on Q2, starting with earnings per share. This quarter, we grew adjusted EPS by 11% to $3.04. GAAP EPS in the quarter were $2.77, up 50% from Q2 last year numbers. The GAAP results include the onetime gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 4% year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue increase included 5% organic growth, 1% growth from acquisitions and a foreign exchange headwind of 2%. Turning to our growth by geography. North America and Europe both grew in the mid-single digits, Asia Pacific grew in the high single digits with China growth in the mid-teens, and rest of the world declined low single digits. Looking at operational performance. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 6%, and adjusted operating margin was 23.5%, up 40 basis points from Q2 of last year. We saw strong productivity from our PPI Business System and good volume leverage, partially offset by strategic investments, unfavorable business mix and a headwind from foreign exchange. The negative impact from FX in Q2 was approximately 4% in our operating income growth in the quarter, 40 basis points in our operating margins and 4% on our adjusted EPS. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in Q2 was 46.7%, down 60 basis points from the prior year. In the quarter, strong productivity was offset by unfavorable business mix, strategic investments and the headwind from FX. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 19.4% of revenue, which is down 80 basis points versus Q2 2018. Total R&D expense came in at 3.9% of revenue. And R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q2 was 6.5%. Looking at results below the line for the quarter. Our net interest expense was $121 million, down approximately $20 million from Q2 last year, driven primarily by debt reduction. Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of $18 million, higher than Q2 2018 primarily due to changes in non-operating foreign exchange. Our Q2 adjusted tax rate was 11%, which is 130 basis points lower than Q2 2018, driven primarily by the impact of our tax planning initiatives tied to U.S. tax reform. Q2 average diluted shares were 403 million, which is 3 million lower year-over-year, mainly as a result of our share buybacks, partially offset by option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations for the first half of the year was $1.94 billion and free cash flow was $1.53 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $410 million. This represents 25% growth in our free cash flow year-to-date. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and investments. Our total debt at the end of Q2 was $19 billion, up $900 million sequentially from Q1. And our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was three times total debt to adjusted EBITDA. And wrapping up my comments in our total company performance. Adjusted ROIC increased to 11.4%, up 110 basis points from Q2 of last year. We continue to drive excellent returns on investments Now I\u2019ll provide you with some color on the performance of our four business segments, starting with Life Science Solutions Segment. In Q2, reported revenue increased 9% and organic revenue growth was 10%. Growth in this segment was led by our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions increased 17% and adjusted operating margin was 35.6%, up 230 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong productivity and volume pull-through, which is partially strategic investments and the headwind from foreign exchange. In the Analytical Instruments Segment, reported revenue increased 1% in Q2 and organic revenue growth was 3%. Growth in the quarter was led by the chemical analysis and chroma mass spec businesses. Adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments was 2% lower than Q2 2018, and adjusted operating margin was 21.6%, down 60 basis from the prior year. In the quarter, we saw headwinds from unfavorable mix, strategic investments and FX, partially offset by good productivity. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics Segment. In Q2, total revenue grew 1% and organic revenue growth was 3%. Growth in this segment was led by our clinical diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses as well as our health care market channel. The growth was partially offset by the performance in our Anatomical Pathology business. Adjusted operating income was 4% lower than prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 25.7%, down 150 basis points year-over-year. Roughly half of the margin change was due to the performance of the Anatomical Pathology business. For the remainder of the segment, strong productivity gains were more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. Finally, in Lab Products and Services segment, Q2 reported revenue increased 3%. Organic revenue growth was 4%. Growth in the quarter was led by the pharma services business and the research channel. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 2%, and adjusted operating margin was 13.1%, which is 10 basis points lower than the prior year. In the quarter, we saw strong productivity and volume leverage. It was offset by strategic investments, unfavorable business mix and a headwind from FX. Now I\u2019d like to move on to our updated full year 2019 guidance. As you saw in our press release and as Marc mentioned earlier, we\u2019re raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. Let me walk you through the details. I\u2019ll begin with revenue. We\u2019re raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $80 million and tightening the range by $100 million. The $80 million increase at the midpoint consists of two elements. First, a $30 million increase in our organic growth outlook for the year. We continue to expect full year 2019 organic growth to be between 5% and 6%. The second element of the increase in our revenue guidance is an additional $50 million to reflect the actual timing of the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. Turning to adjusted earnings per share. We\u2019re increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.06 and tightening the range by $0.04. The $0.06 increase at the midpoint consists of three elements : a $0.04 increase to reflect stronger operational performance; a $0.01 increase to account for a less adverse FX environment versus our previous guidance; and a $0.01 increase to reflect the timing of the Anatomical Pathology sale. To sum it up, our 2019 revenue guidance is now a range of $25.3 billion to $25.5 billion, which represents 4% to 5% growth versus 2018. And our updated adjusted EPS guidance for 2019 is now a range of $12.16 to $12.26, which would represent growth of 9% to 10% versus 2018. Adjusted operating margin is now expected to be about 23.6%, which would result in margin expansion of 50 basis points. A few other details behind the revised 2019 guidance. Starting with FX, currency rates continue to fluctuate in Q2. The mix of the FX rate changes since our last guidance had no net impact on revenue : a $10 million adverse impact from adjusted operating income and a $15 million positive impact on FX below the line. So for the full year, we continue to assume that FX will have a negative impact of approximately $400 million on revenue or 1.6%, 10 basis points of margin and $0.23 or 2.1% on our adjusted. The sale of our Anatomical Pathology business is now complete. This creates a year-over-year headwind of approximately $120 million on revenue, $50 million of adjusted operating income, 10 basis points of margin and $0.09 of adjusted EPS. We\u2019re seeing that there\u2019s no change in the trade tariff environment in 2019 versus our previous guidance. And as a reminder, we expect that the year-over-year growth tariff impact to be $30 million, which is just over 10 basis points of margin and approximately $0.07 of adjusted EPS. Moving below the line. We\u2019re continuing to assume year-end debt will be approximately $17.7 billion and that net interest expense will be about $470 million. We\u2019re assuming that other net income will be about $40 million, which is $15 million higher than our prior guidance, reflecting the additional benefit of non-operating FX realized in Q2. We continue to expect that the 2019 adjusted tax rate to be 11%, unchanged from our previous guidance. And we continue to assume net capital expenditures will be between $925 million and $975 million for the year. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $4.1 billion, no change from previous guidance. And we assume we\u2019ll return approximately $300 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, no change in the previous guidance. And we continue to estimate the full year average diluted share to be approximately 404 million. Note, our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures. And finally, a few comments on our latest view on the quarterly phasing for the remainder of the year. In terms of organic revenue growth, we see Q3 being around the average for the full year. In terms of adjusted EPS, for the remaining six months of the year, we expect that it\u2019ll be phased across that second half of 2019 in a similar way to the same period in 2018. In summary, we delivered an excellent first half and are in great position to achieve our goals for the year. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ken. Ken Apicerno : Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Hey. Thanks. I\u2019d like to start out with Life Sciences Solutions. You put up a terrific number there and you had a difficult comp. I\u2019m wondering if you could provide a little bit more color. I know you provided some consumables to Brammer through that business. Was that part of it? Or could you just maybe talk to trends of Life Sciences Solutions? Marc Casper : Tycho, thanks for the question. Good morning. Yes, we had very strong performance across our Life Sciences Solutions segment, really driven by the strong growth in bioproduction and our biosciences business. And Brammer was truly immaterial to the sales to Brammer in terms of segment results. Tycho Peterson : And then I guess as we think about Brammer integration and scale up, can you talk a little bit about how we should think about the CapEx cycle? And I know you\u2019re also separately bringing in the Glaxo facility. How should we think about CapEx investment and general costs, cell gene therapy and biomanufacturing? Marc Casper : Yes. So in terms of the Brammer Bio acquisition, part of what we\u2019ve assumed is the expansion of an additional site, which we expect to break ground starting this year, and that\u2019s embedded in our outlook for the year. And in terms of GSK, it\u2019s a world-class facility, well-maintained with capacity that fills the needs across our own demand. So other than maintenance CapEx, we\u2019re not expecting significant new CapEx associated with that facility. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then just one last quick one. On lab products and Services, you had a difficult comp. Was there anything \u2013 even with that, it was a little bit lighter than we\u2019ve been modeling. Was there anything there that slowed or was negative relative to your expectations? Stephen Williamson : Yes. It was a little bit impact from that system outage in terms of some of the revenue recognized in Q3 that would have been in Q2. For us, it really is just the kind of like the growth comps in terms of the progression there, Q1 to Q2. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you. Marc Casper : Thanks, Tycho. Operator : Next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken : Good morning, guys. On the industrial markets, I guess, how are you feeling about sort of the cadence there and how you kind of left off 2Q into 3Q and some of the comps you have in the back half of the year? Marc Casper : Ross, thanks for the question. Good morning. So as I think about industrial and applied, we grew low single digits in the quarter. Really, there\u2019s two dynamics there, which is really good performance in chemical analysis and chroma mass spectrometry in the quarter. And as we mentioned last quarter, we\u2019re assuming that industrial and applied is going to grow more modestly in the second half of the year due to the outstanding performance it had last year in the materials and structural analysis business. We saw some of that dynamic play out in Q2, and we expect that dynamic to continue for the balance of this year. Ross Muken : And then maybe on the acquisition side, obviously your leverage has been coming down partially with the strong EBITDA growth. But you\u2019ve had a little bit, at least relative to your capacity, maybe a good year but not a super-active year. I guess, how are you thinking of kind of the current environment and the pipeline for M&A and valuations relative to maybe the size of some of the deals you can look at and execute on? Marc Casper : So, Ross, in terms of the pipeline, we\u2019re very busy. There\u2019s a lot of activity that we\u2019re looking at. And as you know, we have substantial capacity. We outlined that in our May analyst meeting. And over time, you\u2019re going to see us deploy that capacity on the right transactions, and that\u2019s how we think about it. And I\u2019m very excited about what we closed and announced as well as the one divestiture that we did. And we\u2019ll continue to be good stewards of our shareholders\u2019 capital. Ross Muken : Thanks, Marc. Marc Casper : Thanks, Ross. Operator : Next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik De Bruin : Hi. Good morning. Marc Casper : Good morning, Derik. Derik De Bruin : Can you give us, Stephen, some guidance on the gross margin? It\u2019s consistently a little bit below where The Street tends to model on a quarterly basis. And could you just sort of walk us through how we should sort of think about the gross margin regression? Because I mean, obviously, you hit your operating margin targets because of good SG&A leverage, but the gross margin is a little bit all over the place. Any color you can provide on that would be great. Stephen Williamson : Yes, Derik, thanks for the question. A couple of factors; one is FX as an impact on gross margins is about 3% headwind on the gross margin dollar line year-over-year. But the main feature really is the mix of businesses and the growth and the relative profitability at the gross margin level. With very strong growth in bioproduction, certain product lines in pharma services, and these have a relatively lower gross margin than other businesses in the company but good profitability, so it\u2019s kind of a mixed element within that is really driving that, the gross margin level. Derik De Bruin : And so I guess as you talk about adding capacity in your product, in your bioprocess businesses and your contract manufacturing businesses, how \u2013 I guess looking at trends into next year, should we expect additional pressure on the gross margin there until you sort of fill the capacity? Or is it too early to tell? Stephen Williamson : We\u2019re getting good leverage on our SG&A, which is driving overall good margin expansion of the bottom line. And I think the gross margin profile you\u2019re seeing will play out for some time, but this is about strong growth in the right areas and delivering strong profitability down the bottom line that translates to EPS growth. So I think that\u2019s the appropriate way to think about it. Derik De Bruin : Great. And if I can sneak in one more; the academic and government outlook \u2013 growth this quarter was a little flattish. Is that mostly due to the data center issues or just some general trends on that marketplace? Marc Casper : Yes. So Derik, when I think about the quarter, as you really look into the comps, it\u2019s very similar to what we\u2019ve seen. Geographically, China was strong, a little bit more muted in North America and Europe. The data center outage, in fact, at each of the end markets a little bit, including academic and government, probably affected industrial and applied the most. So as I talked to the teams around the world, they didn\u2019t really see much of a change in terms of what that end market looks like. Derik De Bruin : Great. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Marc Casper : Good morning, Jack. Jack Meehan : I was hoping you could give us an update on FEI and with cryo-EM. It wasn\u2019t something that you called out for the Analytical Instruments segment. Just how its performance in the quarter? How are \u2013 how does the backlog look? And maybe just remind us what you\u2019re guiding to in terms of revenue there, pacing in the back half? Marc Casper : Yes. So in terms of the \u2013 our materials and structural analysis business, which includes electron microscopy and our spectroscopy instruments, we had modest growth in Q2. And our expectation is that we\u2019ll have modest growth in the balance of the year in that business due to the very strong performance that we had in 2018. And we saw some of that dynamic play out in Q2. Pretty much in line with what we had expected during the beginning of the year. So you got visibility with that business usually about six months in terms of how things look. And the outlook looks positive for the long-term. In terms of the life sciences application, we\u2019ve had really nice uptake in the pharmaceutical customer base, still a small proportion of the total. If you recall, when we acquired FEI, it really had the flagship universities around the world acquiring cryo-electron microscopy. And one of the things that we wanted to do was to democratize it towards the pharmaceutical industry, and that\u2019s actually going very well. So that bodes well for the future and expect that over time, life sciences will continue to be a bigger and bigger proportion of total electron microscopy sales, and that bodes well for the long-term outlook for this business as well. Stephen Williamson : And Jack, as a reminder, that profile for this business is essentially built into our guidance from the beginning of the year and consistently in our guidance through the year. Jack Meehan : Great. Yes, that makes sense. And just as a second question. I was hoping you could give a little bit more color on the European region and just how some of the impacts, whether it\u2019s trading tariff or conversation around Brexit and, finally, Easter pacing, how you thought some of those different impacts may have impacted the quarter. Marc Casper : In terms of Europe, conditions were pretty similar to what we\u2019ve been seeing with some level of macroeconomic concern, not Thermo Fisher-specific concern, but there\u2019s lots of buzz about what the world is going to look like. And conditions seem to continue to be stable from that perspective, and our team is doing a good job of serving customers well and helping them navigate the environment. So Europe is playing out with moderate growth. Jack Meehan : Any impact on \u2013 from Easter that you think? Marc Casper : Not a material impact, no. Jack Meehan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Doug Schenkel : Good morning, guys. Marc Casper : Good morning Doug Schenkel : Your original core revenue growth guidance for the year factored in the assumption that China would grow in the mid-teens. If this is still the case, I believe mathematically, this would imply that you\u2019re assuming China growth moderates in the second half versus the first half. So my questions are : first, is China guidance unchanged; and two, are you seeing any change in conditions? And I asked the second question because we have seen some trade data that suggests there was a bit of a moderation in China tools experts over at least the first two-third of the second quarter. So any comments on both of those topics would be much appreciated. Marc Casper : Great analytical question. So conditions are fine in China. When I look at the performance, we had mid-teens in the quarter. When I look at the outlook from the year, no change. There\u2019s not a negative change going forward. So it\u2019s not implying any slowdown in the growth relative to what we expected, and conditions continue to be good. So that\u2019s very positive. One of the real highlights in China is the continued, rapid emergence of biotechnology industry in the country. And that bodes well for all of these innovation companies wanting to work with the best company in the field in terms of supporting their scale up. So really a good end market for us from that perspective. So nothing \u2013 no yellow flags as well to China. Doug Schenkel : Okay. That is super helpful, Marc. And just a quick cleanup, I think, for Stephen. Just back to the data storage outage or the data outage, did that impact margins in the quarter? Yes, I know there was an earlier question about margins. I\u2019m just wondering if that might have had some impact on results as well beyond the top line. Stephen Williamson : Yes. When you think about the revenue here, these are shipments that were about to be made in the last few days of the quarter. So we basically lost the contribution margins with the seasonal profitability that would have gone with them. So it was some impact, but not a significant impact in Q2. Doug Schenkel : Great. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Stephen Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Stephen Beuchaw : Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the time here. One bigger picture one for Marc and then just a couple of tie-ups for Stephen. Like some, I think I may be looking here at the trends, particularly in pharma and, to some extent, in LPS in thinking, well, how is it these guys are doing it? And I appreciate some of the commentary you provided earlier. But I wonder if you could zone in specifically on within pharma, the corporate account strategy. Any chance you could give us some color on how much bigger that is today versus 12 months ago and whether that\u2019s a critical driver? Marc Casper : Yes. So when I think about pharma and biotech in the end market, not a really strong quarter for us, and it was broad-based in terms of across our product lines. Excellent performance from pharma services and bioproduction. Our customers really respect and appreciate the value proposition. We help them with their innovation pipelines. We help them drive productivity. Because of the scale of the relationships we have, we have unique access to the decision-makers. And those customers are doing more business with us, but also the pipeline of activities with us is very strong. So that\u2019s part of it. And these small and emerging companies, the innovators that are in the earlier stages of their history, really are about speed to market, and they\u2019re relying on us to help them through their development work and scale up and help them with their logistics and clinical trials, all things that we do, and that\u2019s also been driving very strong growth for us. So it\u2019s broad-based. It\u2019s not only by customer type within pharma and biotech, but it\u2019s broad-based in terms of our product offering as well. So pretty good end market for us, and we\u2019re uniquely positioned to capitalize on it. Stephen Beuchaw : Okay, much appreciated. And then two quick ones, Stephen, for you. One is, do you have a sense for what the impact on back half earnings is in total for Brammer? And then given that what happened with the data center was a little bit more concentrated on the Analytical Instruments business, any color on growth phasing, specifically for AI? As you were nice enough to provide it, the total company level would be really helpful. Stephen Williamson : Yes. So on Brammer, the timing of the announcement of the \u2013 of the closure of the acquisition had about $0.14 impact on the year. So that\u2019s really in the second \u2013 that all comes in the second half of the year. In terms of the phase, well, I gave the phasing at the company level in terms of the organic growth, and you can think about that for the split between Q3 and Q4. Stephen Beuchaw : And sorry, my question was about phasing in AI. Any chance you have any commentary on Analytical Instruments phasing? Stephen Williamson : So I guess in terms of the phasing, we really don\u2019t go down to that level of detail, and we\u2019ve given you help on that one. So I think that chroma mass spec and chemical analysis are expected to continue to do really well. And Marc outlined the profile for the electron microscopy business, just an idea of how we think the rest of the year will play out. Stephen Beuchaw : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks, guys. Maybe just one, sticking on the AI business. The growth normalized. With the power outage, we had a kind of 5% organic. Still, the latest has been since before FEI became part of organic growth, it didn\u2019t seem like comps were overly demanding there. So I was just wondering, it\u2019s been trending high single, low double digits over the last year. Could you just talk through what you saw there and if any markets were kind of softer than they\u2019ve been in the past few quarters? Marc Casper : No, I\u2019d say pretty normal conditions in terms of the end markets. I think that one of the things that\u2019s really exciting was how ASMS played out for us, and that bodes well for the second half for our chromatography and mass spectrometry business. And it\u2019s probably in the noise level, some stuff there, so I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. The conditions seem good. The teams felt good about what the outlook is for the business. In terms of the materials and structural analysis business, I think we covered that one already. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. And then maybe just specifically on the Fisher channel business. Can you just talk through the performance there? Any change in the end market trends? Any change in the competitive landscape? Would be helpful to hear. Marc Casper : Yes. So when you think about our products and services, our pharma services business had an excellent quarter. We had good growth in our channel business and more moderate growth in our lab products business. So that\u2019s sort of how you get to the numbers that we reported in that segment. No change to the competitive dynamics in the channel business, and that business continues to perform very well. Patrick Donnelly : Thanks, Marc. Operator : Next question comes from Dan Brennan with UBS. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping, Marc, you can walk us through a little bit in China, just go to the various segments and how they performed to you in particular, just give us an update on anything related to generics and food as well. Marc Casper : Yes. So Dan, thanks for the questions. China continues to be very strong. And when I look at the details of that, we have minimal exposure to the generics industry, so not a factor for us. And food continues to be fine from that perspective. When I think about the growth in the quarter, we had good growth in our materials and structural analysis business, but not as strong as it was in the prior year. So that\u2019s probably the single biggest driver of the slight change in growth, but no change in the robust outlook for China for us for the year. Dan Brennan : Great. And then to some \u2013 back to biopharma business, really strong again. I think your guidance for the year was high single. You guys are running low double digits right now. Is low double digits sustainable? Or should we be expecting kind of a moderation in the back half implied in your guidance? Marc Casper : Yes. When I think about the full year outlook, Pharma & Biotech is going to come in somewhere between high single and low double. That\u2019s the range that it\u2019s going to come in for the year. Stephen Williamson : Yes. And Dan, as a reminder, the way we guided for the year is essentially a normal year-end spend by our customers, which will include Pharma & Biotech in Q4, wherein we\u2019ll see how that plays out in terms of comparison against two years of strong year-end spend in Q4. Operator : Next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Dan Leonard : Thank you. So first off, staying with pharma. Marc, can you disaggregate the performance there between bioproduction and the rest of your exposure to Pharma & Biotech? Is that \u2013 how important is bioproduction to the double-digit growth rate? And will you be growing double digits if you thought about the business excluding that? Marc Casper : It\u2019s a good question. I haven\u2019t done all of the math that way. But I would think it would have been high single. If you took bioproduction out, you probably will have high single-digit growth in all the other businesses. We had businesses that \u2013 other businesses that also grew double digits beyond bioproduction and certainly a customer set. But bioproduction continues to be incredibly strong because of the outstanding market position we have in single-use technologies and cell culture media. Our customers are simply choosing to work with the industry leader and respect our technologies and our expertise, and that bodes well for the future. Dan Leonard : And then a follow-up, Marc. Can you comment on whether or not the pharma M&A environment is impacting your outlook at all there? We now have the third large mega merger announced this year. And I know you\u2019ve historically been well positioned, but the three in one year is kind of a lot. So could you comment on that? Marc Casper : Yes. So we have done well when the pharmaceutical industry has consolidated because we are part of the synergy plans, and we bring our best thinking and help our customers meet their innovation and productivity level. So we will come with proposals to help them be more effective and meet their targets, and our growth has benefited from those events .So we have plans for each of those different combinations. And for the one that\u2019s closed, we\u2019re actively working with the customers; and the other ones, we\u2019re in the planning phase Dan Leonard : Okay. Thank you. Marc Casper : You welcome. Operator : Next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Steve Willoughby : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple for you. First, just following up on Dan\u2019s question. I was wondering if you could just give us some insight on how much your bioprocess or bioproduction business grew this quarter. I believe in the past, you\u2019ve been talking about how it\u2019s been growing over 20% the last few quarters. And a few of your competitors in that space have highlighted how that business maybe even accelerated for them in 2Q. So just wondering if you saw that as well. And then I have a follow-up. Marc Casper : We had another outstanding quarter in bioproduction. And of the results that I\u2019ve read so far, we\u2019re the fastest-growing bioproduction company organically. That\u2019s how I would characterize it Steve Willoughby : And then, Marc, on more than one occasion here this morning, you\u2019ve called out strength in chroma and mass spec. And so I\u2019m just wondering if you can maybe elaborate a little bit more on that, if you see that strength as being more market-related versus share-related, and is that strength or the growth you\u2019re seeing in chroma mass spec any different than what you\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters. Marc Casper : No. This is a business that we have consistently gained market share, I don\u2019t know, for the last five, six years, maybe longer. And when I look at what the outlook is for the business, I look how the team performed, I look at the feedback from ASMS, it felt like another typical quarter for us. Steve Willoughby : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Next question comes from Sung Ji Nam with BTIG. Sung Ji Nam : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Marc, just another one on pharma. Could you remind us what\u2019s your exposure to small molecule versus large molecule? Just curious if there\u2019s anything to call out on the small molecule side this quarter. Marc Casper : We obviously have exposure to all modalities. On a percentage base, I don\u2019t know the exact split off from my head, but it\u2019s going to be more weighted towards large molecule because life science tools and diagnostics, the industry has more activity in the value chain in biologics than they do small molecules. As you think about it, the technologies are actually used in the production of the medicines; whereas instruments in small molecule, well, they\u2019re not. They\u2019re just used in the QC of those medicines. So as the pipelines have shifted and activity has shifted to biologics, that\u2019s benefited our industry and, in particular, it\u2019s benefited us. Sung Ji Nam : Okay. And then just on the genetic analysis side, you highlighted some good \u2013 some innovations there on the PCR side. Could you give us an update on the next-gen sequencing side, kind of how that segment has been performing? Marc Casper : Yes. A very small proportion of the total company, but another very strong quarter in oncology as we continue our strategy of helping oncologists diagnose patients, and we\u2019ve had a very strong quarter in that segment of the business. Sung Ji Nam : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Catherine Schulte : Good morning, thanks for the questions. Turning to China, with 2020 being the 5th year in China\u2019s 5-year plan, any color on what you\u2019ve seen in prior cycles in that final year? And have you historically seen any budget flush-type dynamics? Or conversely, any slowdown as they position themselves for the new Five-Year Plan? Marc Casper : Historically, we have not in terms of sort of a real dramatic change. And usually, the new plan is well socialized so that folks know what to focus on within the customer base. Stephen Williamson : And their revenue base is actually pretty broad-based across different needs across China. So if you\u2019re more a pure-play competitor, more exposed to one specific end market, it could be more material. But for us, the breadth really helps. Catherine Schulte : Okay. Great. And then, Marc, you\u2019ve talked about Brammer quickly becoming a $0.5 billion business for you potentially. Once you have the Lexington facility up and running along with the other currently planned expansions, would those give you the capacity to reach that $500 million threshold? Or will you need more expansion to get there? Marc Casper : Yes, that will cover the capacity needs to meet that number. Catherine Schulte : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Mike Gokay with Janney. Paul Knight : Hi, Marc, it\u2019s Paul Knight. How are you? Yes, sorry to hop on late. The acquisition in Cork, Ireland, can you talk about your strategy behind that? And I guess we should expect more pieces to follow as you build a kind of a global strategy in this market. But I guess the question is, what\u2019s the strategy behind the Cork deal? Marc Casper : Sure. Paul, thank you for the question. So a small proportion of our pharma services business is making highly complex Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients that are made in the West. And we have a state-of-the-art facility in Linz, Austria, and we acquired a couple of years ago a state-of-the-art facility from Roche in South Carolina. As we looked at all of the development work that we have won, our capacity utilization is getting high. And it was much more cost-effective to buy another state-of-the-art facility from GSK and never thinking about breaking ground because facilities like this would cost $0.5 billion plus if you try to build it from scratch, if not more. And we\u2019re acquiring that for EUR90 million with a base of business. And capacity utilization is attractive to a divesting entity because the facility is not fully utilized, and they know that we will be able to continue to utilize that facility, improve the economics through volume leverage and create a very strong assurance of supply for the existing medicines that are produced there. So it\u2019s kind of a \u2013 it\u2019s a \u2013 in a way, it\u2019s a CapEx project is the way to think about it, but you\u2019re buying it with some level of volume, an amazing workforce and state-of-the-art facility. So that\u2019s the essence of the strategy there. So let me wrap up here. We\u2019re pleased to have delivered an excellent first half. We\u2019re in great position to achieve another outstanding year. And as always, thank you for the support of Thermo Fisher Scientific, and we look forward to updating you at the end of Q3. Thank you, everyone. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

So with that, I will now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thank you, Ken. Hello and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our Q3 call. We delivered another great quarter, achieving strong financial performance, while continuing to effectively execute our growth strategy to make Thermo Fisher Scientific an even stronger partner for our customers. As you saw in our press release, we delivered excellent revenue and earnings growth. It was another active quarter for new product innovation and we expanded our global capabilities to enhance our unique customer value proposition. We also continue to execute our capital deployment strategy, completing strategic M&A to further strengthening our offering and returning capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. We carried our strong growth momentum into Q3 by capitalizing on the continued strength of our end markets and the opportunities we had to gain share with our customers. We have a lot of highlights to cover this morning, so let me begin with an overview of our Q3 financial performance. First, we delivered excellent growth in adjusted EPS achieving a 12% increase to $2.94 per share. Our revenue in Q3 increased to $6.27 billion, growing 6% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income increased 9% to $1.42 billion and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points to 22.7% in the third quarter. So by all measures, it was another excellent quarter for us. Now, I will give you more color on the quarter, starting with an overview of our performance in our end markets. In Q3 market conditions continued to be strong and we delivered excellent growth. In pharma and biotech, we had very strong performance in Q3, we delivered another quarter of double-digit growth with strength across all of our businesses serving this end market. We continued our excellent momentum here by leveraging our unique value proposition to help our customers accelerate their innovation pipelines and increase productivity. In academic and government, we delivered mid single-digit growth in Q3, and so good growth in this end market across all of our major geographies. Turning to industrial and applied, as we expected, growth here was flat in the quarter due to the very strong growth we delivered in Q3 last year in our industrially focused businesses. It was good to see continued strong demand in our chromatography and mass spectrometry business from this customer set. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, we grew in the high single-digits in Q3. We saw broad-based growth in our businesses serving this end market led by transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics. So in summary, our teams continue to successfully execute our growth strategy, we are clearly gaining market share and that is reflected in our strong results. That is a good segue to a more detailed discussion of our growth strategy, which as you know, consists of three elements. Continuously developing high impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in the high growth and emerging markets and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. We continue to make great progress in each of these areas in Q3 and then I will cover some of the highlights. First, in terms of new product innovation, we are focused on creating significant value from our leading R&D investments. We are committed to helping our customers advance their work by continuously raising the bar on speed, accuracy and ease of use. Q3 was another productive quarter for innovation and we kicked it off with a strong showing a two major industry conferences in early August. First, at the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, we launched new analytical instruments for the diagnostic laboratory that ultimately help clinicians make better decisions for their patients. Our Thermo Scientific portfolio of USFDA-Class 1 medical devices now includes three new systems. The TSQ Altis and Quantis MD mass spectrometers and the Vanquish MD HPLC. These instruments help customers and clinical labs meet their goals for sensitivity and throughput in a regulated environment. Second, during Microscopy & Microanalysis conference we unveiled a new generation Krios instrument in our Cryo-EM platform for structural biology applications. The Krios G4 makes it possible to obtain high resolution images of increasingly smaller protein structures and with greater throughput and reliability. This instrument expands the market and structural biology by adding new performance features that makes it easier to operate for both new and experienced users. In addition, with its more compact size, the Krios G4 fits into a standardized lab. These benefits will make the cutting-edge technology accessible to a broader customer base. We also had exciting new product launches in our Life Science Solutions segment, let me highlight a couple. We have been leveraging our deep expertise in genetic sciences to expand our offering for molecular diagnostics. A good example from the quarter was our real-time PCR pathogen detection system, it improves the diagnosis of respiratory infections and leads to better decisions about antibiotic treatment. And finally, to meet increasing demand for greater efficiency and bioproduction, we launched a scalable bioreactor workflow called Thermo Scientific TruBio Discovery Automation System. This solution connects bioreactors, controllers, and software to help customers more easily transfer data and accelerate scale up as they move from research to clinical trials and into commercialization. Turning to the second element of our growth strategy, leveraging our scale in the high growth and emerging markets, we continue to capitalize on our industry-leading presence to drive growth. We reported strong performance in these regions in Q3, led by 30% growth in China. Our industry is perfectly aligned with the government priorities in China's five-year plan and that continues to create many opportunities for us. Our outlook there remains very positive and we continue to invest to best serve our customers and distance ourselves from the competition. For example, in Q3, we enhanced our pharma services from biosciences capabilities to serve the growing biopharmaceutical industry in China. In Suzhou, we expanded our clinical trials capabilities to support the growing number of studies being conducted in China. This new facility further strengthens our pharma services offering in the region where we have been successfully serving the growing pharma and biotech industry for quite some time. It will provide high quality primary and secondary packaging solutions for these customers and ultimately patients who are undergoing clinical trials. As China encourages the formation of an innovation driven by our pharma industry locally, we see exciting prospects for continued growth. With this investment, Suzhou will become Thermo Fisher's largest clinical trials logistics facility in the region. It's part of our strategy to create an integrated clinical supply chain network in China, with a focus on quality, cold chain logistics and advanced packaging and distribution. In Shanghai, we opened a Biosciences Customer Exploration Center to help scientists accelerate disease and translational research. It consists of two showcase Thermo Fisher laboratories that demonstrate our complete workflow solutions for diagnostics development, immuno-oncology and disease modeling. This center will serve as a hub for customers to gain hands-on product experience, customized application development and technical training. Life sciences and healthcare continue to be key focus areas for the Chinese Government and these new capabilities enhance our already strong position in serving the needs of our customers there. The third element of our growth strategy is our unique customer value proposition. Our leading scale and depth of capabilities puts us in an excellent position to gain share and it's clear that our value proposition is resonating well with our customers. To position our Company for future growth, we continue to increase our capabilities both organically and inorganically. I will cover the quarter acquisition of my capital deployment update. But in terms of organic developments, I mentioned three highlights from the quarter that I participated in. In our pharma services business, you may recall, that we announced a major expansion of our biologics facility in St Louis, Missouri, last spring. I recently visited the site and I had the chance to recognize the team for completing the first GMP batch since the expansion was completed. Going from breaking ground to shipping product in 18 months is an impressive accomplishment for a biologics facility. The St. Louis expansion has greatly increased our production capacity to support our global biologics network. This site is now the largest CDMO in North America based on single-use bioproduction platform, which is a showcase of Thermo Fisher bioreactors single-use technologies and automated workflows. I also had the opportunity to go to Greenville, North Carolina's pharma services facility for the opening of our new training center in Q3. This innovative center is equipped with virtual and augmented reality technologies. The goal is to more effectively onboard and train colleagues who work on sterile injectable production lines, which are complex and require extensive training. These cutting-edge tools not only give operators the required level of proficiency in a much less time, but also benefit customers by increasing quality and efficiency. This is a great example of how we invest organically, to differentiate ourselves from other CDMOs and our customer's own internal capabilities. Last, I attended the grand opening of our new transplant diagnostics center of excellence in West Hills, California. We brought our research, manufacturing and distribution capabilities together at this site to more effectively meet the needs of our customers and the patients they serve. It was great to hear firsthand from transplant patients and their families about the impact we are having by providing diagnostic tools that effectively match transplant donors and recipients. I'm now going to give you an update on our capital deployment activities. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined strategy, which as you know is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In terms of M&A, let me start with an update on our acquisition of Brammer Bio. This is a viral vector CDMO that we acquired in Q2. The integration is going very well and the business is off to a good start as part of Thermo Fisher. Our product businesses serving the gene therapy market are already benefiting from the deep expertise that Brammer Bio brings to our Company. We also completed our acquisition of the GlaxoSmithKline site in Cork, Ireland, right after quarter-end. This site produces active pharmaceutical ingredients or APIs that are used to treat diseases including childhood cancers, depression and Parkinson's. The court site is capacity to our API network to support customer demand and we are very pleased to welcome 400 new colleagues to Thermo Fisher. We are excited about the prospects for the site and look forward to leveraging this world-class facility to capitalize on growing demand for API development and production. Looking forward, our M&A pipeline continues to be very active and we remain disciplined stewards of capital. From a return on capital perspective, in addition to our dividend in Q3, we repurchased $750 million of our stock just after quarter-end. One final comment on capital deployment. After quarter -end, we refinanced $5.6 billion of debt. Our unique scale and financial track record allowed us to complete a very attractive refinancing of our debt portfolio to further strengthen our Company and create shareholder value. With that I would like to review our 2018 guidance at a high level. As you saw our press release, we are raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full-year. The increase is based primarily on our strong Q3 operational performance and also the benefits of our refinancing activities. We are raising our revenue to a new range of $25.34 billion to $25.50 billion, which would result in 4% to 5% revenue growth over 2018. In terms of our adjusted EPS, we are raising our guidance to a new range of $12.28 to $12.34, which represents 10% to 11% growth year-over-year. So to summarize our key takeaways from Q3, we executed very well to continue our growth momentum and delivered excellent revenue and earnings performance. We launched new products and expanded our capabilities to enhance our customer value proposition and we also continue to execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy to create value for our customers and our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson.  Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Mark, and good morning everyone. I will begin by taking you through an overview of our third quarter results for the total Company, then provide color on our four business segments and conclude by reviewing our updated 2019 full-year guidance. Before I get into the details of our financial performance, let me provide a high level view of how the third quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call in July. As you saw in our press release, we delivered a very strong quarter in Q3 with 7% organic growth and 12% increase in adjusted earnings per share. The 7% organic growth was approximately $90 million more than we would assumed in our prior guidance. Adjusted EPS was $0.09 higher than we had assumed at the midpoint of our previous guidance. This was driven by $0.06 from strong operational performance and $0.03 from a less adverse FX environment. So another excellent quarter for the Company. Now let me provide more detail on the quarter. Starting with our total Company financial performance. In Q3, we grew adjusted EPS by 12% to $2.94. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $1.88 up 7% from Q3 last year. On the top-line, our reported revenue grew 6% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue increase included 7% organic growth, 1% contribution from acquisitions, 1% headwind from foreign exchange, and a decrease of 1% due to the divestiture of our Anatomical Pathology business. Turning to our growth by geography, North America grew in the mid-single digits, Europe grew in the high single-digits, Asia-Pacific also grew in the high single-digits, with China growing at 13%, and rest of the world grew in the low single-digits. Looking at our operational performance, Q3 adjusted operating income increased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 27%, up 60 basis points from Q3 2018. We delivered strong productivity and volume pull through offset in part by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. The headwind from foreign exchange in Q3 was just over 1% on revenue and adjusted operating income, but there was no material impact from FX on adjusted operating margin expansion or adjusted EPS in the quarter. As a reminder, the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business was completed last quarter. The impact of the divestiture on Q3 with a $55 million reduction in revenue, $20 million of adjusted operating income and just over 10 basis points of adjusted operating margin and $0.04 of adjusted EPS. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total Company adjusted gross margin in Q3 was 46.1%, down 10 basis points from the prior year. In the quarter, strong productivity was up offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 19.5% of revenue, an improvement of 60 basis points versus Q3 2018. Total R&D expense came in at 3.9% of revenue, R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q3 was 6.6%. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $111 million, down approximately $10 million from Q3 last year, driven primarily by debt reduction. Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of $26 million, which is higher than Q3 2018, primarily due to changes in non-operating foreign exchange. Our Q3 adjusted tax rate was 11.2% which is 30 basis points lower in Q3 2018. Q3 average diluted shares were $404 million, which was $2 million lower year-over-year mainly as a result of the share buybacks, partially offset by option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations for the first nine-months of the year with $3.1 billion and free cash flow was $2.4 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $619 million. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and investments. Early in Q4, we repurchased 750 million of our shares, and trade $750 million of our shares bringing our total repurchases for 2019 to $1.5 billion. In Q3, we returned $76 million to shareholders through dividends. Now turning to our debt portfolio. During Q3, our total debt reduced $2 billion to $17.1 billion driven by a strong year-to-date cash flow generation. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.6 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA, down from three times at the end of last quarter. In addition, as Mark mentioned earlier, we recently completed refinancing $5.6 billion of our debt. The new debt has an average maturity of 15 years and an all in average interest cost of 1.48%, which is half the current adjusted P&L cost of the debt that it replaced. This represents an interest saving of approximately $20 million per quarter for our adjusted P&L. And wrapping up my comments on our total Company performance, adjusted ROIC increased to 11.6%, up 120 basis points from Q3 of last year. We continue to drive excellent returns on investment. Now I will provide you with some color on the third quarter performance of our four business segments, starting with the Life Science Solutions Segment. In Q3 both reported an organic revenue growth of 13%. We saw very good growth across the segments led by our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income in Life Time Solutions increased 19% and adjusted operating margin was 34.5%, up 160 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull through which is partially offset by strategic investments. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 2% in Q3 and organic revenue growth was 3%. Growth in the segment was led by the chroma and mass spec business. Q3 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 6% and adjusted operating margin was 23%, up 100 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw a very strong productivity. This was partially offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics Segment, as a reminder, this is the segment that used to include the Anatomical Pathology business that we divested last quarter. In Q3, total revenue declined 2%, organic revenue growth in this segment was 7%. We had good growth across the segment led by the transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics. Adjusted operating income was flat the prior-year due to an 8% impact from the divestiture. Adjusted operating margin was 25.3%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw a strong volume pull through in productivity, which was partially offset by strategic investments, unfavorable business mix and a 50 basis points impact from the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, both reported and organic revenue growth was 6%. We saw strong growth this quarter across the segment led by our pharma services business. Adjusted operating income in this segment increased 1% and adjusted operating margin was 11.6%, which is 50 basis points lower than prior-year. In the quarter, we saw strong productivity and volume leverage, which is offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. Now I would like to move on to our updated full-year 2019 guidance. As you saw in our press release, and as Marc mentioned earlier, we are raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. Let me walk you through the details. I will begin with revenue, we are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $20 million and tightening the range by $40 million. The $20 million increase in the midpoint consists of three elements. First, a $19 million increase in our organic growth outlook for the year, which reflects the strong Q3 performance and no change in our assumptions for Q4. This increases our organic growth outlook for the full-year to 6%. The second element is $90 million, a more adverse FX versus our previous guidance, and the third element is an addition of $20 million of revenue to reflect the acquisition of the Cork, Ireland API facility. Turning to adjusted earnings per share. We are increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 and tightening the range by $0.04. The $0.10 increase to the midpoint consists of four elements, a $0.06 increase from the strong Q3 operational performance; $0.04 increase to reflect lower interest expense. As a result of our recent debt refinancing; a $0.02 increase to reflect the benefit of the share repurchases we undertook in early Q4, and a $0.02 reduction to account for a more adverse FX environment versus our previous guidance. Let me give you a bit more detail on this change, the $0.02 reduction is comprised of a $0.03 benefit in Q3, a $0.05 reduction in Q4 relative to our prior guidance to foreign exchange. To sum it up, our 2019 revenue guidance is now a range of $25.34 billion to $25.50 billion, which would represent 4% to 5% reported growth versus 2018 and 6% organic growth. And our adjusted EPS guidance for 2019 is now a range of $12.28 and $12.34 which represent growth of 10% to 11% versus 2018. Adjusted operating margin is now expected to be about 23.5% which will result in margin expansion of 40 basis points to 50 basis points. A few of the details behind the revised 2019 guidance. Starting with FX, the mix of FX rate changes since our last guidance had an adverse $90 million net impact on full-year revenue, a $30 million adverse impact from adjusted operating income and a $20 million positive impact below the line. So for the full-year we now assume that FX will have a negative impact of approximately $500 million in revenue or about 2%, 10 basis points of margin and $0.25 or 2.2% on our adjusted EPS. Next, we continue to expect the year-over-year gross tariffs impact to be approximately $30 million, which is just over 10 basis points of margin impact and approximately $0.07 of adjusted EPS, no change from our previous guidance. Moving below the line, we are now assuming year-end debt will be approximately $17.5 billion. Our net interest expense will be about $450 million, down $20 million from the prior guidance reflecting the benefit of our recent debt refinancing. And we are assuming other net income will be about $60 million, which is approximately $20 million higher than our July guidance reflecting additional benefit of non-operating FX realized in Q3. We continue to expect the 2019 adjusted tax rate to be 11%, unchanged from our previous guidance. We are continuing to assume net capital expenditures will be between $925 million and $975 million for the year. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $4.1 billion, no change from previous guidance. We assume a return about $300 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, no change from our previous guidance and we now estimate our full-year average diluted shares will be approximately $403 million, approximately $1 million lower than our previous guidance reflecting the recently completed share buybacks. My guidance does not assume any additional share buybacks this year and does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures. In summary, we continue the strong performance we delivered in the first half of the year and achieved an excellent third quarter. We are very well positioned to achieve our goals for the year. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth Apicerno : Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we are ready to open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : Hi, thanks, and congrats on the quarter. I want to start with the fourth quarter guide, the comp is slightly easier sequentially. I'm just wondering, with the 5% guidance, is there any kind of macro deterioration that you are factoring in there or is it just maybe some prudent conservatism. Marc Casper : Tycho, thanks for the question. When you look at the assumption for the fourth quarter, it remains identical to what we started with the original part of the year back in January and to all the subsequent guidance which is assuming the normal year end pattern budget spending. So, as a reminder, the last couple of years 2017 and 2018, we had above average or strong year-end spend, and you don't get visibility to that, and so very late in the quarter. So, our convention has been normal year-end, is what we are assumed in our guidance and that positions that is the way the year plays out, that we will have delivered a fantastic year. If you get another very strong finish from budget flush, then it will be an even better year in terms of performance. So that is how we are thinking about it and we are not seeing anything in the macro environment that is giving us a change to Q4 from like a negative or conservative viewpoint. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then for the follow-up on biomanufacturing, obviously you are putting up great numbers there. We did hear from one of your peers yesterday about some potential concerns over capacity in particular around biosimilars. So I'm curious, if you could comment on your thoughts there on capacity for the industry right now. And then as we think about cell and gene therapy separately, obviously there have been some mixed data points around the Sarepta denial and that [indiscernible] Spark. But I'm just curious if the pipeline there is still very robust around Brammer. If you could comment on that? Thanks. Marc Casper : Yes, so Tycho thanks for the question. So our bioproduction business is doing great. Right. And it really is performing at a very high level. Our customers appreciate the strong positions we have in cell culture media and single use technologies where we are the industry leader. We had a great quarter. So that is continuing. In terms of how we see the market, we have all the companies so we have the best insight, because we have our bioproduction business, which gives you one lines. We obviously have a biologic CDMO which gives you other lines, and then we have these very deep relationships across the biotech and pharmaceutical industry. And what we are seeing is a very robust pipeline of activity. So we feel good about what the future holds. In terms of cell and gene therapy, these are young industry, and you are going to see individual Company volatility, but the promise around cell therapy and gene therapy continues to be very strong and we are very excited about our competitive position, both in our pharma services business as well as our product businesses serving that market. So we feel good about the outlook there. Thanks Tycho for the questions. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to start with the China region, so 13% growth was right around what we are looking for, but obviously been a little bit more noise, which has come out. So I was just wondering as you looked across the businesses. Are there any areas where you have any concerns or what are some of the areas that are doing better, are there any areas that are doing weaker, if you just walk us through it, that would be great? Marc Casper : Jack, good morning and thanks for the question. In terms of China, another excellent quarter, right. When I look at how we have been performing very strong. Our customers value the capabilities that we bring to the Chinese market and our industry continues to be so incredibly well aligned with the government priorities around their five-year plan, which is we enable environmental protection, the expansion of the healthcare system, building an innovative pharma industry. Those are all things that our technologies across our industry benefit front Thermo Fisher, as the industry leader, and a very unique competitive position that we have in China positioned us even better in terms of our performance and you see that in our results. In terms of the details of what is going on in China, really conditions continue to be very, very similar to what we have seen in the last couple of years. And as a reminder, the comparisons in our industrial business also play true in China, meaning that we had a very, very strong year end finish, the second half of last year in the industrial businesses globally. So we have a difficult comparison there and you see that in the results across industrial end markets. But you see that in China a little bit as well. So the 30%, very strong growth we are on track to deliver mid-teens growth for the year. So where we will see it. Jack Meehan : Great. And then just as a follow-up on the Analytical Instruments business , the underlying growth even if you adjust for some of the timing dynamics seem to moderate a little bit, could you walk us through what are you seeing in terms of the market, in terms of the macro versus share gain in terms of certain products and then finally I didn't hear electron microscopy get called out, just how are you threading the needle between Semi versus Cryo there would be helpful. Thanks. Marc Casper : Yes. So it's a good question. Jack, in terms of Analytical Instruments. That is the segment where we have our most industrial exposure in terms of our business with most industrial exposure and we had a very strong second half last year in electron microscopy and chemical analysis. So we expected and we have been articulating since the begin the year that we expected the second half in our industrial businesses to have more muted growth because of the challenging performance -- the challenging comps against the amazing performance we have last year. So that is kind of the context. When I think about the more detail below that, the chrome and mass spec business continues to perform at a good level. Obviously, others have not reported in our industry yet, we are first of the major companies. So it's hard to know exactly what our results are versus others, but based on the customer feedback we have, we feel very good that Q3 was another excellent quarter of share gains there. So, that will be validated in the next week or so. In terms of electron microscopy, the long-term outlook for our business is outstanding. We have great interest both in our materials science applications ranging from battery development, semiconductor, advanced materials through the Life Sciences applications. So when I think about where that business is long-term prospects are continues to be mid to high single-digit growth business over the long term. So we feel good about our position in Analytical Instruments and how we are performing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a really nice spring here. Marc maybe going back to that Life Science question biopharma, bioproduction really strong, but we are seeing both the stack, double-stack acceleration here in a quarter-on-quarter accelerating, maybe can you parse out what - is this an end market growth versus how much of this Thermo just because of scale may be outperforming the markets, and I think you also mentioned in LPS, your services business is up strong, but what about the non-services business, maybe just commentary on those end markets, I think would be helpful starting point. Marc Casper : Sure. So Vijay thanks for the question. First of all, pharma, biotech is a setback from on how we are doing another quarter of double-digit growth consistent what we have seen now for a number of quarters. The markets are good, but our competitive position is truly unique and we are clearly growing faster than the industry and gaining market share, and that is because our customers understand that we really do have a unique value proposition that helps them to accelerate their innovation and at the same point help them drive their productivity and all of our businesses did well, serving that customer set. So we feel good about that and as I highlighted earlier bioproduction continues to perform at a very, very high level also, so pharma biotech continues to be very good. When I think about some of the other segments Lab Products and Services. And when I think about that across all of the businesses there, which includes our lab products businesses, our pharma services business and our channel business. They all had very solid quarters with good growth. So nothing particularly differentiated between those businesses, they all had strong quarters on the top-line. Vijay Kumar : Thanks. And then maybe one big picture question, you guys have been phenomenal. When it comes to capital deployment over the years. Just given where the rate environment is when you look at valuations across the sector. Maybe, a talk about how the funnel is looking and appetite for M&A. Marc Casper : So, thanks. No, in terms of capital deployment. we have a very active funnel, right and it continues to be very active. And the way we think about it is we have a very disciplined process and where we have been really successful is doing the right transactions that is very much valued by our customers, strengthening the Company\u2019s long-term strategic position, and ultimately creates meaningful shareholder value. And when I look at the pipeline, I feel very good about what the prospects are there. And the key for us is that, we have always been disciplined and we always will be disciplined, right. So, we will do the right things. And when I think about this year, what a great year in terms of strengthening the balance sheet for the long term, right. With getting an average duration of 15 years on our new debt. And doing that, have the interest costs that positions us well. It gives us tremendous financial flexibility. And at the same point, we have done one mid-sized bolt-on in Brammer, we have done the Cork acquisition, a few small deals as well, and cleaned up one aspect of our portfolio, which was selling off the Anatomical Pathology business. So, so a very solid year there, we have returned capital as well and I feel great about what the M&A pipeline looks like. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Go ahead please, your line is open. Derik De Bruin : Stephen, I have a question for you. So, ever since you guys bought Patheon, you the street seems to be mis-modeling your gross margin number. I mean, every quarter I get a call that, \"Your Thermo BDPS\" and I have to have a conversation about how other gross margin numbers came in lower and like that. And so I think there just seems to be some mis-modeling that goes on with this. Can you just sort of walk people through the dynamics on the gross margin line and sort of how the mix and plax everything like this. And it's ultimately it's a question on how should we think about on any one quarter, sort of like year-over-year gross margin expansion or how to look at it like that. Because there is consistently this, this debate we have every quarter on what the right margin number is, and sort of like how to model it. Stephen Williamson : Yes, Derik. Thanks for the question. So we will take a long look back. So, yes, so Patheon is a scale business with significantly lower gross margins on the average for the Company. So to the year the anniversary is back into our numbers that you saw that for a 12-months, over four quarters of some pressure on reported gross margins, still a good business performance on the line that in the Pharma Services business. And then the mix of our revenues been such that the lower gross margin businesses in the Company, but lower cost to serve below that, there is still decent profit margin businesses have been growing the fastest. So bio-production and then the channel business and then pharma services is also growing very well, as well. So that is a continued pressure on reported margins, but still very good in terms of generation of adjusted operating income dollars. So seeing that dynamic play out. And recently we are investing fairly significantly into our Pharma Services business for future revenue growth. So that is the one other elements. And then this quarter, and you will see it over the next couple is, we are selling the Anatomical Pathology Business, that also plus a little bit of pressure on the Company\u2019s gross margins on a reported basis. So when I think about modeling going forward. Well, I expect the Company to get some benefit in terms of margin expansion coming out of gross margins, but not significant, and that it's really SG&A leverage. With the strong revenue growth on the top-line that is really going to be driving the overall operating margin expansion for the Company in terms of the long-term outlook for the next three years. Derik De Bruin : Great, thanks for clarifying that. And you mentioned the Anatomical Pathology sale. Can you remind us how - a little bit hit on the margin. What was that sort of like that the drag on the gross margin? drag on the track and organic revenue growth on that business. And where I'm getting out, 7% growth in diagnostics in the quarter, very strong. How much of that was Anatomical coming out, plus how much of that was sort of like gains from some of the delays you had in the second quarter, just on incremental volume? Stephen Williamson : So, Derik, in terms of the strong performance in healthcare and diagnostics and the strong performance in our Specialty Diagnostics business, we have really broad-based momentum, right in terms of really excellent growth in transplant, in immuno-diagnostics, and very strong performance in our healthcare market channel. So the divestiture of Anatomical Pathology, which was a slower growing business, actually had a minimal impact on the organic growth performance. Marc Casper : And offset the tailwinds from Q2 in terms of the revenue that was delayed in terms of shipments there. But not a significant impact overall when you look on a net basis. Derik De Bruin : Great. And if I can continue. Since you mentioned transplant diagnostics, which is haven't really talked about that for a while. As I think back, there was a time a couple of years ago when people were worried that One Lambda was going to get waked from next-gen sequencing coming into the market. And obviously you are now opening new facilities. Can you talk about how sort of that has expanded. I'm just very curious to see that, because I remember that was a debate we had several years ago with people. Marc Casper : Yes, so in terms of transplant diagnostics incredibly important capabilities that we serve the healthcare community globally, which is we help match recipients with donors and we help clinicians monitor transplant health, right in terms of organ acceptance or rejection, right. So critical part of the medical decision on process there. But business has performed well. It's highly profitable, it's been good growth. And truly an inspirational opportunity. I love what I do, but the opportunity to talk to patients that recognize the role we play, the doctors that make those decisions, the laboratorians that do the work to match the recipients with the donors. I had that opportunity in August when we opened up our new facility in West Hills, which is an amazing set of capabilities. We have hundreds of people attending, it was really an awesome experience. And highlights the competitive advantage we have. Right, there wasn't a customer but didn't leave there saying, okay, this is the industry leader investing for a bright future. We have our next-gen sequencing workflows by the way in transplant diagnostics. So we have made that transition as well and we continue to be very strong performance there. Derik De Bruin : And then, I just one follow-up. Since I will to take advantage of being on the call here. You know one of your competitors has been making a big push into the third-party services market. Can you sort of talk about your Unity Lab Services business and sort of like the dynamics and industry, and what is going on with it. It's one of those areas we are just, we really have a lot of visibility. And so I'm just sort of trying to reconcile that with, with some of the, some of the trends and commentary from some of the other competitors. Marc Casper : It's performing well, it's growing, probably grew around the Company average. Probably a lot higher somewhere in that range, so performing at a good level . [indiscernible] our customers, we wind up with a large number of our colleagues working at our customer site to ensure effectiveness of how they operate their laboratories and making sure they're getting great experiences with our products. And it's a good business in terms of building customer regions and continues to perform at a good level. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Go ahead please, your line is open. Doug Schenkel : Good morning and thank you. I want to talk about Europe run through a few Q3 clean-ups. And then just talk through a couple of year-end and to 2020 dynamics. So starting on Europe, in a quarter where you had strength in a lot of different areas. I would argue, one of the most surprising things was your robust revenue growth performance in Europe. Based on what we have read and heard from others, high single-digit growth is pretty impressive and surprising, especially given your high single-digit comp. Can you provide a bit more detail on Europe performance by segment and also share if there is anything interesting in terms of monthly cadence? Marc Casper : Yes. So Doug, thanks for the question. You know, it's been interesting, right. If you read the sort of popular press about Europe, you have this for quite some time. You have this very bleak view, right sort of everything is slow and so forth. If you then look at our performance over the last number of years. Our performance in Europe is very strong. So, that is because our value proposition resonates, right, there is a big pharmaceutical industry presence there that we are very well positioned to serve. We have strong presence serving the diagnostics market, our high-end instrumentation is valued by customers, and the business is performing well. The high-single digit growth reflects very good performance of the team, and we have been delivering strong growth in Europe. So when we did our reviews with our European leadership and myself and members of our Company leadership team spent time with the commercial team at the end of the quarter in Europe and market conditions where we serve continue to be good, and our share gain momentum is excellent. So nothing really jumped out to me as being particularly surprising. I was just pleased with the job well done by the team. Doug Schenkel : Okay, that is great. Now for the clean-ups, On the data storage outage. I just want to confirm was the impact of recapturing revenue lost in the second quarter about $50 million, and if so, would you break that down by segment and comment on whether or not there is anything more to recapture related to that between now and year-end. Stephen Williamson : Yes, Doug. Thanks. So, as we outlined on the last call approximately $50 million of revenue shifted from Q2 to Q3. These orders that are ready to shift to customers right at the end of the quarter were delayed by the system average and then were shipped in early Q3. So that is basically across the line. Doug Schenkel : Okay. And then the other clean up was on Bioprocessing. Just wondering if you could comment on whether or not our math is right, which leads us to conclude that you might have grown 20% to 25% in the quarter, are we in the right neighborhood? Marc Casper : Yes, you are in the right neighborhood, Doug Schenkel : Okay and then just - okay, it's a good neighborhood. Alright. And then just a couple of looking ahead questions . There has been, I guess the first one is, there is been lots of focus on the outlook for year-end budget flush. How important has a budget flush been to you the last few years and how important is it in the context of this year's guidance. So that is the first one on budget flush. The second is in terms of your visibility heading into 2020, do you think your customers are likely to complete 2020 planning and budgeting later than usual given the macro backdrop and just all the uncertainty out there, and if so, how does that impact your planning and then the third is kind of a higher level question for you, Marc. 10 to 15 years ago, if we were heading into an election year where there were heightened concerns about the environment for biotech and pharmaceutical companies regardless of size and then also by extension concerns about the availability of capital for relatively smaller but higher-growth emerging companies. I think it's fair to say a decade a decade and a half ago that we would be concerned about the possibility of a moderation and spending for that end market. We may be facing some of those dynamics looking ahead to 2020, is it fair to say that the complexion of your biopharma end market exposure or really just the overall nature of that end market has changed enough over the last decade, where you can say at these dynamics materialize that they'd be less problematic today for Thermo than they were 10 to 15 years ago. Thank you . Marc Casper : Sure, great question. Let me take a shot at that and the first one is , customers do planning later macro environment. something I had a of a lot of doubt actually in preparation for this earnings call. And when I think back over the last two decades here, it actually doesn't feel that there is any more uncertainty or challenges then really the normal level of noise, right. I remember discussing terrorism risk and discussing dramatic changes in FX and sequestration, all of these things and when I sit there and say, yes, there is a lot - we have an administration that is very publicity oriented, but when I think about the big picture issues Science is great. The economy is pretty good around the world and our industry is doing very well. So when I think about planning, I think it's going to be pretty normal in terms of the process across the industry. In terms of, you know, biotech and funding and all of those things, the end market continues to be strong, the science is excellent, if you have a view and it might change [indiscernible], our Company mix has changed, right. If you think about a decade ago, our exposure in biotech and pharma would have been more purely on the research side of the equation, and today you have more of a balance with clinical trials, capabilities, development and production. So, the mix is different in that latter stage is typically stickier in terms of the movement. And then in terms of budget spending and so forth, something that it's hard to have a scientific view of it, our best view of the difference between a normal year and a strong year in terms of organic growth in the quarter, probably two points, meaning that, if you go from normal to strong about two points of growth, additional in that represents roughly half a point of growth for the full-year and that could be off a little bit, but it gives you at least the magnitude of the difference between normal and strong. Stephen Williamson : Yes [indiscernible] about kind of planning and these environment. It's about being flexible and it's about iterative planning and making sure that you are up to date in terms of how you thinking about operating through an environment with things that change pretty rapidly. So, companies are becoming more and more used to that environment and operate accordingly. Marc Casper : We are ready for the next question. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Go ahead please, your line is open. Steve Beuchaw : Hi, good morning, thanks for the time here. I have one actually for Stephen, and then I will follow up with a broader question for Marc. Stephen, in obviously good reasons you guys have stepped up investments in CapEx for CDMO capacity and then broadly capital deployment for CDMO capacity. How should we think about modeling that over the next few years, are we stable at this new level or do we see growth over time in those investments? Stephen Williamson : Steve, great question. If you want to think about the pharma services business. We have got great opportunities to capture long-term organic growth with the customers set that we have both large pharma and biotech and more biotech customers. So we recognize that and we are adding the right capacity and capabilities to help continue to fuel that growth for the long-term. So that gets us and we think about our business being kind of mid to high single-digit business and I'm putting investments to maintain at the high end of that level of growth. And if there are future opportunities that unfold themselves, to be able to get great returns and will add appropriately income to CapEx, you will see this year and next year slightly heightened level of CapEx in that business that links to these great, great customer prospects and we will see how that pans out from that going forward. But really, to maintain the great organic growth method . Marc Casper : One thing I would add just kind of at one level off, which is - we did refinancing and it really a huge savings in our earnings. Right. And we took the $20 million of Q4 benefit to the bottom line. as I think about next year, we will have another $60 million benefit from the lower interest costs. We will likely reinvest a little more than half of that to continue to accelerate our growth momentum in not per se just in pharma services, but we have amazing prospects given our share momentum. So I think you will see us likely reinvest some of those savings into fueling continued amazing future for the Company. Steve Beuchaw : Got it. Very, very helpful. And then, Marc, I wonder if you could talk about proteomics for a minute. I know there is again for good reason a lot of optimism about the growth trajectory there. But over the last, let's say nine-months or so there has been more competitive noise in this space and historically you've been not just a good grower, but a share gainer in proteomics. Can you talk about that trend and how, if at all, your view on those trends evolve downstream of the 2019 where some others have entered the space. Thanks a bunch. Marc Casper : Yes, the business, our Orbitrap franchise is performing very well. And when I look at the product launches, we had it ASI American Society of Mass Spectrometry in Q2, very strong customer interest. We have had good order shipments, performing very well and there is always competition, but we are very well positioned to continue to drive growth. Funding in proteomics is very good. Right. It is, if you think about, you have the genomics revolution, proteomics is really where a huge level of funding is right now and looks to continue to have and we are the industry leader and well positioned to drive good growth in that part of our business. Steve Beuchaw : Okay, I really appreciate all the color here. Marc Casper : Thanks Steve. Yes. Operator, we have time for just one more. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Go ahead please, your line is open. Brandon Couillard : Thanks, good morning. Marc, just curious if you could speak about Patheon to core growth in the third quarter and perhaps share an update on where you stand in terms of the revenue synergy pull through from that asset? Marc Casper : Yes, so the integration is complete. The business is performing at an excellent level, we exceeded the cost synergies, really driven by excellent impact from our PPI Business System revenue synergies right on track. And interestingly enough, the funnel of wins, which is future revenue. You can see it in the number of expansions that we are announcing across our network that really is driven by revenue synergies, right. We basically have sold out our API network and we acquired the Cork facility. You saw us announce expansion of sterile [indiscernible] and biologics and networks and that really is just a reflection of how strong our customer interest is because of Thermo Fisher's reputation and the excellent performance from pharma services,. The business grew about the Company average in terms of our performance in the quarter. Brandon Couillard : And last one for Stephen, can you just share net pricing in the quarter, and what you've baked in for the full year? Thanks. Stephen Williamson : It's a net pricing continue to be good. So just under 1.5% across the Company and that is in line with how we would be performing for this year. So expect that to continue, however, we are doing a good job of offsetting some of the tariff impact of pricing and being disciplined as well. Brandon Couillard : Okay, Thanks. Stephen Williamson : Thanks Brandon. Marc Casper : So let me wrap up here, with a strong nine-months behind us, we are really in a great position to achieve another excellent year. As always thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. We look forward to updating you early in 2020. Thanks everyone. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thank you, Ken. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our 2019 Q4 and year end call. I'm pleased to report that we finished the year strong and exceeded our goals for 2019. From our financial perspective, as you saw in our press release, we delivered excellent revenue and earnings growth. From our customer lens, we launched many exciting new products and added new capabilities to strengthen our unique value proposition. And for our shareholders we continued to be good stewards of capital, making strategic acquisitions and returning capital to create significant value. All in all, it was an excellent year. We've positioned Thermo Fisher very well to begin this new decade as an even stronger company. I'll cover some of the highlights later in my remarks, but first I'll hit the financials from the quarter and the year at a high level. Starting with the quarter, our revenue increased 5% in Q4 year-over-year to $6.83 billion. Organic growth was also 5% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 5% to $1.70 billion and our adjusted operating margin expended 10 basis points in Q4 to 24.9%. Finally, we achieved strong adjusted EPS growth in the quarter with 9% increase to $3.55 per share. Turning to our results for the full year, we increased revenue by 5% to $25.54 billion in 2019. Organic revenue growth was 6% for the year. Adjusted operating income increased 6% to $5.97 billion. We expanded adjusted operating margin by 30 basis points to 23.4% and we delivered another excellent year of earnings performance in 2019, with an 11% increase in adjusted EPS to $12.35 per share. As you know, our store performance is fueled by the power of our PPI Business System. Our colleagues use it across the company to improve all aspects of how we work. This is not \u2013 this not only leads to strong earnings growth, but also helps us continuously make our company even better and that creates a great experience for our customers and our 75,000 colleagues around the world. Let me now give you some color on our performance by end market for the quarter and the year. Starting with pharma and biotech, we had excellent performance again in the end market delivering 10% growth during Q4. We saw broad-based strength across our businesses serving these customers. Our unique depth of capabilities gives us a clear competitive advantage and we continue to strengthen our offering to gain share, which I'll cover later in my remarks. Our leading position in serving pharma and biotech customers led to double-digit growth in this end market for the year. In diagnostics and health care, we saw strong growth in our immunodiagnostics, clinical diagnostics and healthcare market channel businesses in Q4 and we grew in this end market in the mid-single digits for both the quarter and the full year. Turn into industrial and applied, growth in this end market declined in the mid-single digits in Q4 compared with the double-digit growth we delivered in Q4 last year. This was predominantly driven by our electron microscopy business, a dynamic consistent with what we saw in Q3. For the full year industrial and applied grew in the low-single digits. In academic and government, we grew in the low-single digits during the quarter and for the full year. Finally, let me comment briefly on our performance from a geographic lens. In Q4, we grew in China in the low-single digits. This was driven by very strong comparisons in the year ago quarter, coupled with a slower release of funds for capital purchases by some of our customers. Our performance in North America and Europe was very strong, driving excellent revenue growth for the total company. That speaks to the strength of our portfolio and our global competitive position. To sum up our performance, market conditions continue to be good overall and our team's executed well to achieve another excellent year. We continue to effectively leverage our unique customer value proposition to deliver a very strong growth. That's a good transition to our growth strategy and I'll use it as a framework to recap some of the highlights for the quarter and the year. We continued our strong momentum across all three elements of our strategy to put Thermo Fisher in the best position to win with our customers and gain market share. Starting with the first pillar of our strategy, it was an exceptional year for high-impact innovation. We launched exciting new products every quarter and across all of our technology focused businesses. I will highlight just a few this morning. In analytical instruments, you'll recall it was a big year for us at ASMS, with the introduction of our new generation of Thermo Scientific Orbitrap instruments. We strengthened our mass spec leadership with the new Exploris 480 and Eclipse Tribrid systems, which significantly raised the bar in protein analysis. We're pleased to see very strong customer demand for these products. In our electron microscopy business, we launched our new generation Krios G4 instrument for structural biology during the year. And in Q4, we introduced the Metrios AX for industrial applications. This new system uses machine learning to automate the collection and measurement of critical data, ensuring quality and efficiency for our customers. In our specialty diagnostics segment, we added a number of new assets during the year, particularly in our immunodiagnostics business where we continued to expand our menu of ImmunoCAP allergy tests. In transplant diagnostics, we extended our family of LABScreen reagents in Q4. Our new single antigen ExPlex reagents greatly expand the number of HLA antibodies that lab directors can characterize to help identify the risk of organ rejection in transplantations. Turn to our life sciences solutions segment, we launched a range of the products to strengthen our bio-production, biosciences and genetic sciences offering highlighted by the QuantStudio 6 and 7 Pro real-time PCR systems. In Q4, we introduced the Qubit Flex Fluorometer, which is designed to measure up to eight samples simultaneously and with highly accurate and reproducible results. And to cap off an excellent year, in Q4 we launched the Genexus system, to extend our Ion Torrent next generation sequencing platform. This fully automated system is a real game changer, delivering results in a single day and requiring minimal amounts of sample for analysis. We've continued to make great progress with our oncology-focused NGS strategy and Genexus is a significant milestone in our goal to ultimately bring NGS to local hospital settings. I'm proud of the passion our teams have for innovation and that makes a real difference for our customers. This has always been a key element of our culture. So clearly another fantastic year in that regard and we look forward to continuing our momentum in 2020. Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy, leveraging our scale in high growth and emerging markets we had strong performance across these key regions in 2019. And that included another great year in China with 13% growth. Looking forward, the government priorities in China are aligned with the technologies we provide, to meet customer demands for biologic drugs, a cleaner environment and safer food supplies. And we continue to build on our industry leading scale to help them solve these challenges. You will recall that we highlighted many new developments during the year, including the expansion of our clinical trials operations in China to meet growing demand. During the quarter, we opened a new pharma and biotech customer solution center in Shanghai. The center showcases our expertise in critical analytical processes and specialized workflows to help our customers accelerate their development of novel therapeutics. I came away from my visit to China in Q4 with incredible excitement for how rapidly the biotechnology market is expanding there and how well positioned we are to support that growth. To sum it up, Thermal Fisher has a distinct advantage in China and that we've created by leveraging our unique industry leading scale and that allows us to deliver an exceptional experience for our customers there. This is a strategy that plays out across our high-growth and emerging markets around the world. As you heard during the year, we also continue to build on our capabilities in South Korea, India, and Singapore, that help our customers advance their work in life sciences, biopharma and food safety applications. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition. And we continue to enhance it to help our customers meet their goals for innovation and productivity. We've been talking a lot about our offerings for pharma and biotech because it's a great example of how we're bringing together our existing capabilities and adding new ones to be the strongest partner for these customers. We have a proven formula for serving these customers and it resonates from large pharma to smaller virgin biotech. We can support them from the discovery of a molecule all the way to making it a commercial medicine. And we do this through a combination of continuing to strengthen our product offering by introducing relevant new technologies, leveraging our scale and the extensive customer access we have to our research and safety market channel and continuing to expand our CDMO service capabilities, which also drives revenue synergies across our portfolio. This is a formula that's working very well and in the 2019 we once again delivered double digit growth with our pharma and biotech customers. It's been over two years since we acquired Patheon and we've successfully completed the integration. We were able to turn a business that was growing in the mid-single digits into a high-single digit grower with a bright outlook. We've already covered a lot of our pharma services development during the year, but at a high-level our approach has been a combination of organic investments and strategic bolt-on acquisitions. Organically we've continued to expand our global network to meet customer demand, including our capacity for biologics production and sterile fill/finish services. We've also acquired new capabilities to strengthen our position. We added the new API manufacturing facility in Ireland that we acquired from GSK and we significantly increased our capabilities in the high growth gene therapy market with the acquisition of Brammer Bio. In early December, I attended the grand opening of our new viral vector facility in Lexington, Massachusetts. Our team there is super excited about the opportunities we now have to help our customers bring innovative new therapies to patients with rare diseases. The integration of Brammer Bio has gone extremely well. Business performance is strong and I'm really excited about this potential. So excellent momentum is serving our pharma and biotech customers, it's clear that our value proposition is a key competitive advantage for us and we continue to gain share. Turning now to capital deployment, as you know, we have a great track record here in creating value for our shareholders by being good stewards of capital and we continue to successfully execute our strategy in 2019. First we deployed $1.8 billion on strategic bolt-on acquisitions. Second, we continue to return capital to our shareholders for a total of $1.8 billion in share buybacks and dividends. Last, you recall that we announced in Q3 that we refinanced $5.6 billion of our debt and that will generate $80 million in savings annually for us. So it was a great year from a capital deployment and balance sheet perspective as well. Let me cover one last highlight from the year before I turn to our guidance and that relates to our commitment to environmental, social and governance priorities. We've always been a company that's focused on doing business the right way. And that's embodied in our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer. We not only bring our mission to life every day, but we also have robust programs that connect our customers, colleagues and communities so we can make a direct impact. This happens in a number of ways, including through our STEM education and environmental sustainability initiatives, still much more to be done here, but I'm proud of the work our teams are doing to raise our ESG profile and continue to make our company even better. Stephen will dwell on the assumptions that factor into our revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly cover the highlights. In terms of our revenue guidance, we expect to deliver between $26.61 billion and $27.01 billion in 2020, which would result in reported revenue growth of 4% to 6%. We're initiating adjusted EPS guidance for 2020 in the range of $13.49 to $13. 67. This will lead to 9% to 11% growth year-over-year. Before I hand the call over to Stephen, I'll leave you with my key takeaways for the year. We've consistently achieved excellent revenue earnings growth and extended our track record with another year of strong performance in 2019. We're delivering an exceptional experience for our customers by continuing to enhance our unique value proposition and using our PPI Business System to make our company even stronger. And we've continued to create significant value for our customers and our shareholders, which puts us in a very strong position as we begin the decade. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc and good morning everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our fourth quarter and a full year results for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our four segments and conclude with a detailed review of our initial 2020 guidance. Before I get into the details of the financial performance, I thought it'd be helpful to provide a high-level view of how the fourth quarter played out versus our expectations the time of our last earnings call. As you saw in our press release, we had a strong finish to the year and delivered results ahead of our prior guidance on both the top and bottom line. We delivered 5% organic growth and adjusted EPS was $0.04 higher than the midpoint of our previous guidance, reflecting good volume pull-through along with incremental, favorable below-the-line FX. Our strong performance in Q4 enabled us to deliver 6% organic growth for the full year 2019 and 11% growth in adjusted earnings per share, so excellent financial results in 2019. Now let me give you some more color on our performance, starting with the earnings results. You saw on our press release we grew adjusted EPS and Q4 by 9% to $3.55. For the full year adjusted EPS was $12.35 up 11% versus 2018. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $2.49 up 12% from Q4 last year, and 2019 full year GAAP EPS with $9.17 up 27% versus the prior year. On the top line, our Q4 recorded revenue grew 5% year-over-year in Q4. The components of our Q4 reported revenue increase included 5% organic growth, approximately 1% growth from the net of acquisitions and divestitures and a foreign exchange headwind of approximately 1%. For the full year 2019, reported revenue increased 5% year-over-year. This includes a 6% contribution from organic growth or 1% positive impact from the net of acquisitions and divestitures and a 2% headwind from foreign exchange. Turning to our growth by geography during the quarter. North America grew in the mid-single digits, Europe grew in the high single-digits, Asia-Pacific grew in the low single-digits including China which also growing in the low single-digits, and rest of the world grew in the mid-single-digits. For the full year, North America grew in the mid-single digits, Europe and Asia-Pacific both grew in the high single-digits, and rest of the world grew in the mix single-digits. Turning to our operational performance, Q4 adjusted operating income increased 5%, adjusted operating margin were 24.9%, up 10 basis points in Q4 of last year. We saw strong productivity from our PPI Business System and good volume leverage. This was partially offset by strategic investments, business mix and the impact of acquisitions and the divestiture of our Anatomical Pathology business. Q4 margin expansion was 30 basis points lower than we'd assumed in the last guidance. Half of that was driven by FX and the other half by incremental investments to fuel future growth. For the full year adjusted operating income increased 6%. Adjusted operating margin with 23.4%, which is 30 basis points higher than 2018. We've got strong productivity and volume pull through just partially offset by strategic investments, business mix and the impact of acquisitions and divestiture. For the full year FX was a headwind at 2% on revenue, 10 basis points on adjusted operating margins and 2% on adjusted earnings per share. As a reminder, our divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business at the end of Q2 was $0.09 dilutive in 2019 and a year-over-year headwind of approximately $120 million on revenue, $50 million on adjusted operating income and 10 basis points on adjusted operating margin. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 46.3%, down 60 basis points from Q4 of the prior year; 50 basis points of this was the impact of acquisitions and the divestiture. For the full year adjusted gross margin was 46.4%, down 30 basis points from 2018. For both the quarter and full year, strong productivity and volume pull through were more than offset by business mix, strategic investments and the impact of acquisitions and the divestiture. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 17.65% of revenue, an improvement of 70 basis points versus Q4 2018. Total R&D expense came in at 3.8% of revenue, 10 basis points lower than Q4 last year. For the full year adjusted SG&A was 19.1%, an improvement of 60 basis points compared to the full-year 2018. R&D expense was 3.9% of sales, 10 basis points lower than the prior year. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue for the full year was 7.1%. Looking at results below-the-line for the quarter, our net interest expense with $97 million, down $30 million from Q4 last year. Net interest expense for the full year was $450 million, a decrease of $80 million[ph] from 2018. The reduction in net interest expense was driven by debt reduction and our refinancing actions. Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of $16 million, higher than Q4 2018, primarily due to changes in non-operating foreign exchange. Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 11.7%, down 50 basis points versus Q4 2018. Our full-year adjusted tax rate with 11% in line with previous guidance is 90 basis points lower than the full-year 2018 primarily reflecting the beneficial impact of U.S. tax reform and our continued tax planning initiative. As I mentioned on the Q3 call, we repurchased $750 million of our shares in early Q4 bring the total repurchases of 2019 to $1.5 billion. Average diluted shares were $402 million in Q4 and $403 million for the full year, both in line with that prior guidance. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. For the full year and cash flow from continuing operations with $5 billion and free cash flow was $4.1 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of approximately $900 million. During 2019 we also continued to return significant capital to shareholders with $1.5 billion per share buy backs $300 million in dividends. And as Mark mentioned, we successfully deployed $1.8 billion of capital through strategic acquisitions. We ended the year with approximately $2.4 billion in cash and $17.8 billion of total debt. Our total debt was up $700 million from the end of Q3 driven by the completion of our debt refinancing activities, which began in the prior quarter. Our leverage ratio at the end of the year with 2.7 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA in line with our expectations. Wrapping up my comments in our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 11.8% or 12 basis points from last quarter and up 90 basis points in Q4 last year as we continued to generate very strong return. Not provide you with some color on the performance of our four business segments for the quarter and the full year. Started with life science solutions. In Q4 reported revenue in this segments increased 8% and organic revenue growth was 9%. In the quarter we continued to see strong growth in this segment led by bio-production, bio-sciences and genetic sciences. For the full year reported revenue increased 9% and organic revenue growth with 10% Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions increased 11%; and adjusted operating margin was 37.5% up 70 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter we drove very strong productivity and volume pool through which is partially offset by business mix and strategic investment. For the full year 2019, adjusted operating income increased 13% and adjusted operating margin was 35.7% and increased with 130 basis points over 2018 In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue decreased by 3% in Q4 and organic revenue declined 2%. Growth in the segment all businesses have very strong year-over-year comps given the 12% organic growth that we delivered in Q4 2018, particularly in our electron microscopy business. In addition, the slower release of funds for capital purchases in China impacted Q4 growth for the businesses in this segment. For the full year, report revenue in the segment increased 1% and organic growth was 3%. Q4 adjusted operating income in analytical instruments decreased 5%, adjusted operating margin was 26%, down 60 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw very strong productivity, which was more than offset by business mix, strategic investments and volume For the full year adjusted operating income was 23.1%, 30 basis points higher than the prior year. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics Segment. As a reminder this is the segment that previously included the Anatomical Pathology business, which we divested at the end of Q2. In Q4 total revenue decline 1% over organic revenue growth was 7%. We saw strong growth in this segment led by our immunodiagnostics and clinical diagnostics businesses with continued strong growth in our healthcare market channel. For the full year, reported revenue was flat, and organic growth was 5%. Adjusted operating income decreased 5% in Q4, and adjusted operating margin with 23.7% down 80 basis points in the prior year due to the impact of the divestiture. In the quarter, we saw strong productivity and falling leverage, however this was more than offset by strategic investments and the impact of the divestiture and business mix. For the full year 2019, adjusted operating income declined 2%, adjusted operating margin with 25%, contracting 60 basis points year-over-year with a divestiture representing 30 basis points. Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Services segments Q4 reported revenue increased 9%, organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter we saw strong growth across all of our businesses within the segment led by the pharma services business and the research and safety market channel. For the full year both reported and organic revenue grew 6%. Adjusted operating income in the segment for increased 15% and adjusted operating margin was 13.8% which was higher than the prior year by 70 basis points. In the quarter we saw very strong productivity, volume leverage contributions from acquisitions and favorable business mix. This was partially offset by strategic investments. For the full year adjusted operating margin was 12.5%, flat to 2018. With that I\u2019d like to review the details of our initial 2020 guidance. And as Mark mentioned earlier, we're initiating a 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $13.49 to $13.67 which would result in 9% to 11% growth over 2019. In terms of revenue, our guidance range is $26.61 billion to $27.01 billion, which would result in reporter growth of 4% to 6% over 2019. Our initial guidance for 2020 assumes 5% organic revenue growth for the year. With regards to FX in 2020 we're assuming that it's a year-over-year headwind of approximately $100 million of revenue or 0.4% and $0.06 of adjusted EPS or 0.5% largely in Q1 and to a lesser extent in Q2. We expect $0.06 of dilution from the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business, which reflects revenue and operating income headwinds of $105 million and $30 million respectively. We're assuming that the acquisitions we completed in 2019 will contribute approximately $160 million to our reported revenue growth in 2020. Turning to adjusted operating margin, we made the decision to reinvest $40 million of last year\u2019s debt refinancing back into the business. This re-investment impacts 2020 adjusted operating margins by 15 basis points. In addition, we expect to have about 10 basis points of margin impact in 2020 from my decision to renew key commercial contracts for our PCT test business, which is part of our Specialty Diagnostics segment. In exchange with some royalty rate concessions we successfully negotiated long-term contract extensions with most of our PCT commercial partners. With 2020 this creates a headwind of about $30 million of revenue and adjusted operating income, but in return, extensive revenue stream for this highly successful test franchise for many years to come. Factoring in the impact of these two divisions and the benefits of strong volume fall through on the organic growth and continued strong productivity from our PPI Business System, we expect to expand adjusted operating margins by 30 basis points in 2020 resulting in adjusted operating margins of approximately 23.7%. Moving below the line, we expect net interest expense in 2020 to be approximately $340 million. This is $110 million lower than 2019 and reflects the debt refinancing activity we completed this past year and the lower average debt level. We're assuming adjusted other net income will be about $60 million. We expect the adjusted income tax rate to be 10.5% in 2020. The improvements from our 11% rate in 2019 is primarily driven by the continued realization of benefits associated with U.S. tax reform. We're assuming net capital expenditures in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. This represents an increased investment of approximately $150 million over 2019, driven by capacity and capability expansions in our pharmacy services and bioproduction businesses. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $4.55 billion in 2020. The increase over 2019 is primarily driven by our expected strong earnings growth. In terms of capital deployments, our guidance includes a total of $1.5 billion of share buybacks in 2020 which we assume will be completed throughout the year. We're also assuming that we'll return approximately $350 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends. We estimate full-year average diluted share count will be between 400 and 401 million shares. Our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures. It's also worth noting that our guidance does not include any potential impact from the Coronavirus outbreak. It is too early to gauge the impact. We're fully focused on doing everything we can to help our customers and our colleagues address the situation. Finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year. There are several factors to consider. First, note that we have one less day in Q1 and two extra days in Q4 this year. For organic growth standpoint, we expect Q1 to be a couple of points lower than the full-year due to the day's impact and the prior year comps, particularly in the analytical instruments segments. And we expect Q4 to be higher than the full year for the same reasons. From an adjusted operating income stamp margin standpoint, we expect Q1 to be 40 basis points lower than Q1 2019. This is driven by the phasing of organic revenue and the timing of investments in our 2019 acquisitions. Acquisitions and divestitures are approximately 60 basis points diluted in Q1, accretive for the rest of the year and net neutral for the year as a whole. Due to the phasing of revenue and margins in the year we expect adjusted EPS in Q1 to be just over 21% of the full year and Q4 to be approximately 30%. Q2 and Q3 are expected to be about equal. So at a high level to start the year, our guidance assumes 5% organic revenue growth, 9% to 11% adjusted EPS growth to continuation of excellent financial performance track record. As always, we'll strive to deliver the best possible results and I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year. With that, I give the call back over to Ken. Kenneth Apicerno : Thanks Stephen. Operator, we're ready to open it up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : Hey, good morning. Marc, I want to start with performance in the Analytical Instruments business. You had a difficult comp last quarter, but there's a notable quarter-over-quarter deceleration here. Is there anything you could talk to in terms of pacing? Did anything come up late in the quarter? You talked about the China slower release of funds. How much of it was that versus maybe FDI? It looks like FDI\u2019s tracking a couple of hundred million dollars below with semis and Life Sciences lagging suit. Can you maybe talk to those two dynamics and if there's anything else that weighed down AI in the quarter? Marc Casper : Yes. Tycho, thanks for the question. In terms of the analytical instruments, as you said we had 12% growth in the prior year. So our expectations were that we were going to have that as a headwind and our performance was a little bit below the expectations that we had, really happened late in the quarter in China with a slower release of funds from specific customers on high-end capital equipment in that market. When we think about the comparisons, electron microscopy business as you said has a very strong second half in 2018 and actually very strong going into the first quarter of 2019. So we knew we have challenging comparisons there and that played out pretty much as we expected? Tycho Peterson : And then I guess for the follow-up on China. Can you maybe just talk about the gives and takes, obviously you're not factoring any Coronavirus impact, but are you expecting a ketchup on the release of funds? And maybe just talk about some of the other gives and takes in China for the yearend. And is there an opportunity on Coronavirus for you guys on the positive side, is we think about the diagnostics business? Marc Casper : Yes. So let me cover China. From a China perspective, I always liked to keep things in the contact, right, which is we in we had a very strong year in China and 13% growth. And when I look back on the year, we really continue to strengthen our strategic position in the country. Feedback from our customers continues to be positive. We were expecting that we would have mid-single-digit growth in Q4, based on comparisons, which is in the Analytical Instruments business that I \u2013 as I just highlighted and we came in with low-single-digit growth in China versus the mid-single-digit expectations for the fourth quarter. And the driver that was really the slower release of capital or high-end capital equipment. Interestingly enough, when you look at the remainder of the business, which is obviously the majority of the business, the various service businesses and all of our consumer businesses actually play out exactly as we saw in the previous three quarters, very strong growth across the rest of the portfolio. So it seems like the government made some decisions to \u2013 on very large capital equipment purchases to hold funds and so that's our take there and Coronaviruses isn't baked into our forecast one way or the other. Thanks, Tycho. Tycho Peterson : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to probe a little bit more on the industrial and applied end markets, so down mid-single digits in the quarter. Obviously, electron microscopy weighing on that. Just \u2013 I'm curious if you excluded that, what you're seeing in terms of the macro. Was that also weaker year-over-year? And excluding some of the capital seasonality you're talking about there, what does the guidance assume for that as an end market for 2020? Marc Casper : So, Jack. As I look to \u2013 for the year last year, we grew low single digits in industrial and applied. And our guidance has the same low single-digit assumption for the year. And you'll see the flip in terms of phasing, right? We had a very strong year up in industrial and applied at the first half of 2019. And therefore, we have more challenging comparisons as we start this year. And then the comparisons eased substantially as the year goes on, so it's a little bit softer to begin and then accelerating growth as the year plays out. And really, what's assuming is really exactly the same market conditions happening in industrial and applied. The only thing that's changing is really the \u2013 is just how challenging the comparisons are. When you look at sort of the day-to-day run rate business in industrial and applied, there's always some pockets of strength. We saw some strength in applied markets QA/QC applications. You saw some strength, but the larger capital equipment purchases had a difficult comparison primarily in semiconductor and material science applications. Jack Meehan : Great. Okay. And then just as a follow-up. I know Stephen mentioned, I think, all the businesses within AI had a tough comp, but was hoping you could just provide some more color on mass spec and chromatography, how you feel \u2013 did that grow? Or was that negative also in the quarter from the comp? And how do you feel about share gains versus the competitive environment? Marc Casper : Yes. Jack, so in terms of Analytical Instruments, as a reminder, we have three business lines within our Analytical Instruments business our materials and structural analysis was below the segment average and chroma mass spec and chemical analysis. All three businesses declined in the quarter because all three had very strong comparisons. Our chromatography and mass spectrometry business performed the strongest of the three businesses. And when you look at it for the full year, the electron microscopy or materials and structural analysis was below the segment average and chroma mass spec and chemical analysis was above the segment average for the full year. I feel good about our shared performance in terms of how we performed during the course of the year. Thank you, Jack. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik De Bruin : Hey, good morning. Marc Casper : Good morning, Derik. Derik De Bruin : Hey, Marc, can you talk a little bit about sort of the margin profile? I mean, you've done some deals recently, like the GSK deal, and the Brammer deal that have been putting some pressure on margins. And I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense on the go-forward basis on what the margin opportunity will be in. And I mean \u2013 and this sort of bonds into a \u2013 of further capital deployment conversation in that when you sort of look at other assets you could potentially add, is there a lot more stuff like GSK and Brammer that you're looking to add that would be dilutive on this? I'm just trying to get a sense on the pacing of the margin because you're trying to balance this new growth opportunity with step of demands, higher capital investment and lower margins at this point in time? Marc Casper : Yes, Derik. Thanks for the question. So I will try to answer this way. When we \u2013 the first thing is about just M&A generally and how we think about M&A. We actually don't focus on what the starting margin is. Meaning, as you know, over the many years, we've done M&A that was accretive to margins from an operating perspective from day one. And we've done ones that have been dilutive, right? What we look at is what are the return profiles and what can we do with the business and are we the right owner, right? So you'll have things that sometimes short term are headwinds. Sometimes, they're tailwinds. And when we give our guidance, we always try to carve that out to explain it, not just to say, \"Here's the core, everything we have before the acquisition and then whatever the effects are of the acquisitions going forward.\" When I look at the margin expansion, we laid out at the Analyst Day roughly 50 basis points of margin expansion in the \u2013 on average over the three-year model is what was assumed in the base view. And along with that, we had assumptions on capital deployment assumptions on tax rate and so forth. And we've made some interesting decisions, right? What we want to do is always deliver excellent adjusted EPS growth and manage the business in the best possible way. When I look at the end market outlook, I feel very good about the growth prospects. And because we had very good opportunity to refinance our balance sheet during the course of Q3, and because our team was able to identify additional tax planning opportunities, we have very strong EPS growth set up for 2020. And we made a conscious decision to actually reinvest some of those savings, still deliver the same EPS growth, but come out with a basically 30 basis points of margin expansion relative to the 55 that we had explained at Analyst Day, a conscious choice, and Stephen laid out the details. Part of it was trading some short-term margins in our PCT franchise for a decade-long extension of the relationships, which is a great economic deal for the company. And the second was we made the decision because of the talent of our hourly workforce in the U.S. to reinvest additional funds in wage increases and to mitigate the increases in health care cost to that part of our population. And so we're taking a slower rate of margin expansion this year. And then I would expect that margins would be right back where the model was in 2021 and beyond. EPS, no factor one way or the other, just based on the other things that I just articulated. Stephen Williamson : And Derik, just one thing to clarify the comment about the divestiture \u2013 the acquisition and the divestiture impact our margins and on gross margin. That 50 basis points is much, much smaller impact than Q4 on the bottom line in terms of our adjusted operating income. It's kind of \u2013 the gross margin profile of the acquisitions and the divestitures is really what's caused the dynamic there. Derik De Bruin : And so how should we think about that gross margin target for 2020 since the three seems to be all over the place on a quarterly basis? Stephen Williamson : Yes. So obviously, it will depend on the mix of actual revenues that comes in. But I think most of the margin expansion next year will be coming from leverage of SG&A, and roughly flat gross margins is probably a good selling point to think about for the year, those 30 basis points. Derik De Bruin : Okay. Good. I got another follow-up. So it's been a long time since we've \u2013 I've really thought about thinking about NGS and Thermo. I hadn't really thought about Ion Torrent. You closed the Life deal. And so you've been investing more and doing more of that. I guess, can you sort of talk about where you're going for? And would you be interested in getting more into the research space versus the clinical space? I mean, there are some assets out there that are being kicked to the sidelines. I'm just sort of curious in terms of what your general plan is in that market and sort of like how you see that competitive dynamic shaking out given your very large competitors' footprint there? Marc Casper : Yes. So Derik, thanks for the question. In terms of NGS, we have been very focused since 2014 on maximizing the impact of our NGS business. And we really have focused it on the oncology market. And you've seen, over the last five years or so, a steady stream of product launches that really have a benefit for clinical researchers and ultimately patients. And our technology uses less DNA sample to get a read relative to the alternatives on the market, and the ease of use is outstanding. And the Genexus platform, which we launched at AMP in November is being very well received in the market with incredible customer interest because you can change the way you think about how you treat a patient, which is as opposed to sending out a sample and getting a result two to three weeks later with an answer, you can come into work the next day and have your sequence completed. And an oncologist then can make a decision based on the information. That's what Genexus is all about. In terms of extending to other markets, our focus right now is really on oncology and some other applications within \u2013 where our NGS platform is outstanding, and that's where we kept our focus. Derik De Bruin : And you signed an agreement with LabCorp in that market. And I'm just wondering, could \u2013 any idea \u2013 can you give us some idea on sort of what sort of volume LabCorp does in the sort of the NGS space? Marc Casper : I mean, LabCorp obviously runs a huge number of NGS tests across their network. And I thought it was super exciting that roughly been six weeks of launch that they wanted to actually announce to the world their excitement about Genexus and using us to have that within their network. So I think that's a great opportunity. And the specifics, obviously, we're not going to get into, but it's a really nice win for both companies. Derik De Bruin : And if I can squeeze in one more from a client. One investor wants to know what Thermo's exposure is in the Chinese hospital settings since obviously that's \u2013 people are not going there. Just any idea on which how your business sort of breaks down in China on that regard in diagnostics? Marc Casper : Yes. If you think about the health care and diagnostics globally, it's 20% of our revenue. In China, it is actually less penetrated. So it's less than 20% of the Chinese revenue is going to be in the health care and diagnostics setting. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Your line is open. Doug Schenkel : Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to start by going back to the slower-than-expected release of budget funding for capital equipment investment in China. Could you just provide a little more detail on which end markets? Have you recaptured that revenue in Q1 already? Or do you have visibility on recapturing that revenue soon? And how are you treating this dynamic in guidance? So let me pause there, and then we can go to the second topic. Marc Casper : Yes. So Doug, thanks. In terms of the release of funds, 100% driven in government controlled-type entities. So we saw it in certain academic and government customers and in certain parts of the industrial market where they're Chinese state-owned enterprises, right? So a semiconductor fab that's owned by the Chinese government would be an example of an industrial and applied tech customer. In terms of the timing or assumption is that, that will work its way through during the course of the year, but we didn't assume that it would be immediately in the first quarter is the way I would think about it. In our guidance, what we've assumed for China is low double-digit growth is what we assumed in our full year guidance for China Doug Schenkel : Okay, thank you for that. And it's a good segue to the second thing I wanted to unpack a little bit more, which is indeed guidance. So your first \u2013 your initial organic revenue growth target of 5% for the year is on the lower end of your long-term 5% to 7% target that you outlined at the Analyst Day over the summer. Given seemingly strong end market conditions and a lot of the momentum you've had for a little while now, is this just beginning of the year conservatism? Or is this just kind of what you'd expect in terms of a trend towards normalizing towards the mean after a couple of really strong years? And then I guess, just to layer in one more element to the question, and I apologize if I've missed this in your prepared remarks, but could you just share what your assumptions for growth are in terms of what you built into 2020 revenue growth guidance by end market and geography? Thank you. Marc Casper : So first of all, thanks for the question on guidance. I'm super excited about 2020. I mean, that is if you're going to take away the takeaway. So let me put them in context. The last three years, 2017, 2018 and 2019, have been very strong in our end markets and very strong performance of Thermo Fisher relative to those end markets as well. 2020, we expect to be exactly the same thing, another year of good end markets and share gain performance for the company. So we're expecting growth to be in line with the long-term model or consistent with that 5% to 7% organic growth. We're initiating with 5% because the way we think about the world is every year, there's some level of risk and every quarter that those risks don't materialize for our industry, they get retired and it gives you the opportunity to raise guidance as you go through the year. As a reminder, we started out with 5% guidance in 2019. We always were aspiring to deliver the best possible results. I feel great about the 6% that we delivered, and our posture here is the same. We're starting out within the range that we said we would do with the goal as the year unfolds to be able to continue to move higher and higher in that 5% to 7% range. So hopefully, that gives you a sense. And then a little bit of commentary on some of the details on the growth around that. You're going to have pharma and biotech with high single-digit growth. You're going to see mid-single-digit growth in the health care and diagnostics, low single digit in academic, government and industrial applied end markets would \u2013 will give you the drivers of where our growth is going to come from. Doug Schenkel : Great, thanks again. Marc Casper : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Just on the Q1 commentary on the guidance here. Think I heard you say couple of hundred basis points below the year. I'm just curious on was there any days impact or I'm not sure what drives that Q1 below trend? Stephen Williamson : Yes, Vijay. So the one less selling day in Q1, that's just under 1 point of headwind from that. And then it's really the comps from the Analytical Instruments business, particularly electron microscopy. Those will be the driver \u2013 yes, the piece to it. Vijay Kumar : Got it. Then Marc, one big picture question for you. Looking at the cash flow assumptions here, $4.5 billion free cash. You have $2 billion plus existing, but the share repo is just $1.5 billion. That's a significant amount of cash for Thermo. It's been an unusual year for Thermo from a cap deployment perspective. Any thoughts on sort of how the M&A funnel is looking \u2013 shaping up to be and thoughts on the cash burn on the balance sheet? Marc Casper : Yes. So Vijay, thanks for the question. So from a capital deployment perspective, looking back and then looking forward, last year played out well from my perspective, which was we set out the very beginning of the year the goal of finishing the strengthening of the balance sheet from the very active period we had before that. So we did some refinancing. We returned $1.8 billion of capital to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We deployed $1.8 billion in terms of M&A. And as we \u2013 and we generated the cash flow. So as I look to this year, we obviously have a very strong balance sheet. We have a significant amount of capacity. We continue to have a very active M&A pipeline. And as you know, we operate in a very fragmented industry. So plenty of things that we look at. And we'll only pursue things that we feel are aligned with our strategy and create shareholder value. Our return assumption is basically $1.5 billion in buybacks, about $350 million in dividends, which means that what's not on our EPS numbers is just additional deployment of capital, whether it's return or buybacks \u2013 return or M&A or a combination of the two beyond that. And that's the convention that we've always used, which is as the year unfolds, we'll see what the best opportunity is for our shareholders. And we'll deploy most likely in some way and then we'll update you on the impacts to our EPS guidance based on whatever decisions we make as the year unfolds. Vijay Kumar : Thanks for clarifying, Marc. Marc Casper : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Beuchaw from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Stephen Beuchaw : Hi, good morning and thanks for the time here. First, I wanted to drill in just a bit on broader biopharma, and maybe a two-parter. I wonder if you could give us a sense for around the 4Q and year-end, how you saw hardware purchasing dynamics in pharma, specifically relative to the last two, three years. And then prospectively, for pharma in 2020, how do you imagine the hardware component of the pharma growth outlook looks like, whether it's in research it's in research settings or in bioprocess? And then I have one much simpler follow-up. Marc Casper : So, Steve, thanks for the question. When I think about the pharma and biotech performance, really a fantastic year for the company, continuing the trend of many fantastic years. For the year, we had double-digit growth. And when I look at the performance, it was really across the entire portfolio. We saw strength in bioproduction, biosciences, pharma services, analytical instruments in the research and safety market channel. If I left something out, it's not deliberately, and it's due to the sense of broad-based strength across the portfolio. We had a good quarter and a good year in capital equipment to the biotech and pharmaceutical spending. So no change in trajectory there. And we're starting out with a high single-digit growth guidance for pharma and biotech as the initial starting point. So we're expecting strong performance. And if you go back over the last few years, we had historically started out with mid-single to high single-digit growth, and we feel comfortable starting out with high single-digit growth based on the momentum we have in the portfolio. So that's how I would think about it. Nothing particular on capital, I don't really track year-end spend by subsegment so much. I think about year-end spends that are more across the portfolio. And we saw last year playing out in line with our guidance that we had all year, which was a normal year-end spend with some customers having very strong year-end money but others, kind of business as usual, and that kind of averages out in the long run. As a reminder, the previous two years were very strong year-end spends. And from recollection, I think 2016 was a below-average year in spend. And so it varies, but it took \u2013 it played out last year in line with our guidance. Stephen Beuchaw : Okay, much appreciated. And then just a couple of fine points. Within the broader pharma outlook, it's safe to say we can hold up double-digit growth in bioprocess, just as a follow-up to that prior. And then I wonder if you could speak to how things played out over the course of 2019 and how you're thinking about 2020 as it relates to, at the corporate level, price increases year-on-year. And then going into the year, given some of the broader trade dynamics, there was an initiative to look at accelerated pricing. How did that play out? And are we back to normal in 2020? Thanks again. Marc Casper : Yes. So I'll take biologics and then Stephen will cover the pricing. On bioprocess, we had very strong growth. A couple of companies have reported prior to us, and we continue to perform a little north of the levels that others have performed there. Stephen Williamson : Yes. And pricing played out as we had expected in the year, so a good year for pricing, over 1% of price overall offsetting, in fact, the tariffs. So that was really the goal there. And going forward, I generally project kind of just \u2013 like between 0.5% and 1% price as we think about the company's performance in 2020. Stephen Beuchaw : Thank you. Marc Casper : Operator, we have time for just one quick one. Operator : Okay. Our final question will come from the line of Dan Arias from Stifel. Your line is open. Dan Arias : Good morning. Thanks guys. Stephen, on Brammer, just to follow up on the margins there. Can you just touch on the impact of that business on overall margins over time? I think that goes from dilutive to accretive at some point, but I was just hoping you could confirm that. But then also just clarify the timing around that if that is true. Stephen Williamson : Yes. Just on the Brammer margins, we expect it to be just under the company average for the full year 2020. So we'd be getting it up to the decent level at the end of the year. So think about going into 2020, that's right at that pace. Dan Arias : Okay. And then, may be Marc, it's \u2013 I'm sure, a little hard to do, but just given how meaningful it seems like it's been for you guys, are you able to quantify what you think share gains have meant for growth over the last year or so? Marc Casper : Yes. We had \u2013 if \u2013 we had 6% organic growth for the year. We obviously don't have the benefit of everybody reporting, but that's a very solid performance. And when we compare the pieces relative to others, we expect that our share gain will be better than the 1% in terms of growth. And we'll have good clarity on that in the next week or two. So another strong year. So Dan, thanks for the question. Marc Casper : Let me wrap it up here. So first, thank you. We're pleased to deliver really another excellent year. But we're much more excited about what the opportunities that sit ahead of us. And we look forward to updating you on the course \u2013 over the course of 2020. So thanks for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific, and look forward to seeing you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to PPD's First Quarter two020 Earnings Conference Call. Please note, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Nate Speicher, Senior Vice President of Finance for PPD. Mr. Speicher, you may begin. Nate Speicher : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the earnings call. Today, we'll review our financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2020. Joining me on the call today are David Simmons, PPD's Chairman and CEO; Bill Sharbaugh, our COO; and Chris Scully, our CFO. Please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the current business environment and as such, includes certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. More information about potential risk factors can be found in our 2019 Form 10-K and in our upcoming Form 10-Q filing. Also, in addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, we will be discussing financial measures that do not conform to GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures enhance the understanding of our performance because they are more representative of how we internally measure our business. Please note these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is available in the press release we issued last night and supplemental investor presentation posted to our Investor Relations website. Lastly, regarding the basis of presentation for today's discussion, please note that all P&L metrics discussed, including revenue, segment revenue and adjusted EBITDA on an ASC 606 basis. For commercial metrics discussed, including net authorizations, net book-to-bill, backlog and backlog conversion, those remain on a historical as-awarded ASC 605 direct-only basis unless otherwise noted. With that, I'll turn the call over to David. David Simmons : Thank you, Nate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our Q1 2020 earnings call. I'd like to start by saying I hope you, your families and your colleagues are safe amidst the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Given our collective focus on COVID 19, in addition to reviewing our Q1 results, we plan to spend a sizable amount of our time this morning discussing the impact to our business stemming from the virus as well as our ability to minimize the negative impacts and to continue playing a critical role, aiding solution development in the form of treatments and vaccines. In light of the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, we've withdrawn our previously issued guidance for the full year 2020 and today, are issuing new guidance for the second quarter, which Chris will cover in his remarks. Regarding the first quarter results, during the quarter, we saw strong growth across both key commercial and P&L metrics. A few highlights include : net authorizations of $1.06 billion resulting in a Q1 net book-to-bill of 1.3x and notably, we did not see any unusual cancellation activity related to COVID-19; a record ending backlog of $7.3 billion, an increase of 11.9% year-on-year; double-digit P&L growth with revenue of $1.07 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $196.9 million, representing 11.3% and 17.3% growth versus the prior year, respectively, with strong underlying contributions from both our clinical and laboratory segments, which had top line growth of 8% and 31%, respectively; ending cash of $738 million, our highest quarter ending cash balance in over 10 years; continued progress on our balance sheet objectives, with net leverage declining from 6.9x as of Q4 to 4.7x, immediately following the IPO and down to 4.5x as of the end of Q1. While we're pleased with our first quarter results, we continue to be focused on the here and now and managing through this pandemic. Fundamentally, clinical trials exist to address unmet patient needs, and these needs have not gone away as a result of the pandemic. In fact, PPD's purpose and mission have never been more clear and inspiring to our organization than they are at this time. The pandemic has presented headwinds to our business, yet we feel confident that the mitigating actions we've taken and the tailwinds we are experiencing from COVID-19-related work will allow us to emerge from the pandemic in a strong position. During our Q4 earnings call, I shared PPD's three priorities related to COVID-19 and I'd like to provide an update across these priorities. First, our main priority is employee and patient safety. We quickly organized a Pandemic Committee, co-chaired by our Chief Medical Officer and Chief HR Officer to protect colleague and patient safety. Through this team's leadership, we quickly moved to remote work for all remote-capable employees, closed domiciling at our Phase I clinics and instituted measures across our offices, sites and labs to maximize employee safety. Our second priority has been business continuity with the dual goals of delivering for our customers and maintaining financial strength. Across both of these goals, we entered the pandemic from a position of strength. Our long-standing reputation of delivery excellence coupled with our investments in owned-site networks, digital and virtual trial solutions and remote site monitoring tools have enabled us to provide trial continuity solutions for our customers. Our teams are working hand-in-hand with our customers to ensure continuity of their studies. And our customers are looking for our guidance and partnership related to digital and virtual solutions across their pipelines. Bill will provide further details on this front, but the power of our enterprise to fulfill customers' needs has never been more clear. Although more than half of active investigator sites have been impacted, we have adapted and shifted our resources to continue to make progress on our customer studies, such as focusing our team on the trial work not related to site visits and shifting available resources to support new COVID-19 clinical trials. The adaptability of our organization across all levels, our low turnover and the cross-training of our team members continues to embed confidence in our customers that PPD is their partner of choice through this pandemic. Regarding financial strength, it has been important to PPD to maintain our balance sheet while minimizing the impact to our talented colleagues. We have taken a balanced approach to cost mitigation and implemented a program we call Choice, where employees are permitted to take a short-term sabbatical or temporary hours reduction. With more than 600 employees taking us up on this entirely voluntary program, it is clear that this was a needed offering for employees to balance work and family needs while delivering cost savings to the company. Most importantly, this program positions us well to quickly mobilize resources as sites resume clinical trial activity. This last point is critical because we believe when we do get back to something close to normalcy, we will have to execute on our full plan of work plus catch-up work that has been building up. In addition to the Choice program, we have implemented a suite of more typical cost control actions, including fast and severe restrictions on travel, a salary freeze for executive management and paused hiring in areas where demand is delayed while still adding targeted resources for areas of work expansion such as COVID-19-related work. Speaking of COVID-19 work, we are proud to be an active part of the solution to this pandemic. The strength of our infectious diseases and vaccines franchises with experience on 300 trials over the last five years, coupled with our regulatory expertise in this space, has allowed us to build a leadership position in COVID-19-related vaccines and treatments, with 39 awards to date, spanning our clinical and lab segments. We continue to be actively involved in bidding on several dozen additional clinical trials targeting COVID-19. In anticipation of the growing demand for our services, we are proactively building capacity across functions to partner with our customers as they tackle treatment and vaccine development for COVID-19. As you'll recall from the Q4 earnings call, I mentioned that we quickly mobilized a team who has proactively engaged all companies that have announced COVID-19 work in the public domain. I did not expect at that time the depth and breadth of studies that would launch. It has been incredible to see the power of the industry and how fast our customers have turned on a dime to address this global health crisis. And our team has reacted just as quickly. Current treatment studies that we're partnered on are projected to enroll upwards of 13,000 patients. Looking forward, we remain fundamentally bullish about the outlook for PPD in our industry. This pandemic represents a dramatic real-world example of the value the innovative life sciences industry provides to society. I expect this crisis to have a positive impact to R&D investment levels in the coming years as well as aiding accelerated adoption of innovative approaches to trial conduct. We are also experiencing even greater collaboration between pharma sponsors, CROs and regulators, which bodes well for the future of innovative new medicines. Lastly, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 examples I discussed, we believe our differentiated services, unique customer engagement model and continued commitment to operational excellence, will be increasingly important to customers and positions us well for continued strong growth post this pandemic. I'd like to close by saying how proud I am of our 24,000-plus colleagues around the world. Their willingness to go above and beyond for our customers and patients, while exercising caution to blunt the spread of the virus has been truly remarkable, and I'm thankful for their dedication and hard work. We'll continue to provide updates on this topic in the coming quarters as the situation evolves. I'll now turn it over to Bill Sharbaugh, our Chief Operating Officer, to review our operating results. Bill Sharbaugh : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, we saw continued operating momentum across the business with strong financial performance from both our segments. I would call out the exceptionally strong results within our Laboratory Services segment. Our labs produced organic revenue growth in excess of 30% versus prior year, resulting from strong authorizations, rapid customer uptake of new facility expansions in our GMP lab and increased FTE contracts in the vaccine lab. Given the focus on COVID-19, my comments will largely center on our business continuity efforts and how we are responding to the crisis. Our long-standing history of operational excellence, along with our unique mix of clinical and lab services, put us in a strong position heading into the pandemic. Before I go through the segments, I would note that while we are sharing certain operating metrics, as our peers have done, these are inherently difficult to compare across the space. I'll start with commentary on our Clinical Development Services business. Our clinical business is impacted in three ways. First, as David noted earlier, the majority of studies are continuing, and we haven't seen an increase in cancellations. But we have seen several sponsors implement enrollment pauses for studies that have not started or studies with at-risk patient populations, such as immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. For those studies that have yet to start-up, some sponsors are requesting us to complete preenrollment tasks, such as country in-site selection, remote site initiation visits, study, design and planning and database building so that the new trial can start quickly once given the green light. Overall, we estimate that approximately 10% of our clinical services backlog is impacted by these pauses while 90% continues. Second, physical access to sites has been disrupted despite regulatory agencies around the world issuing guidance supporting the continuance of clinical trials while protecting patient safety. In our case, we've seen approximately 54% of site institutions impacted whether it be a suspension of CRA site visits or other site-related activities. About 70% of our clinical trial revenue is not related to site monitoring. Of the 30% tied to monitoring, we've been able to migrate more than half our work to a remote-based approach. We've also deployed several strategies to ensure patient participation can continue. Our logistics network allows us to ship supplies and medications directly to the patient where appropriate. In addition, we are using digital techniques to screen, monitor and enroll patients for some clinical trials. PPD is also looking beyond digital and virtual solutions and traditional sites to find other ways to help customers continue their clinical trials. As an example, within a matter of weeks, PPD designed and operationalized a program that allows the transfer of clinical trial patients from sites that have closed due to the pandemic to our network of 180 research sites, which have remained open and can rescue delayed clinical trials. In addition, several customers moved volume to our medical communications call center as smaller competitors were unable to maintain business continuity. Third, we have won a significant amount of fast burning COVID-19 work, which is helping to partially offset the impacts I've mentioned. Our teams are working tirelessly to launch and execute these studies. In several cases, working through the night to activate sites to allow dosing of critically ill patients the following day. New COVID-19 studies, coupled with the backlog of tasks from ongoing clinical trials, position us for a busy period as we enter recovery. While we have seen work resume with a quickening pace in countries like China, including site monitoring visits and new activations, we expect the recovery to be more gradual throughout the rest of the world. We are poised to accelerate trial delivery as soon as sites reopen. I believe the strength of our people managers and our industry-low turnover will enable us to continue high-quality execution throughout the pandemic and into recovery. Chris will discuss the financial impacts in his comments. Now turning to the Laboratory Services segment. Let me provide some context on how this business has been impacted. To minimize the pandemic impacts, the lab's leadership team mobilized quickly to establish clear safety protocols, implement split shifts, segregate departmental teams and move remote-capable employees home. These strategies, in addition to close coordination with state and local authorities, ensured our scientific staff have access to facilities to progress work in a safe and efficient manner. As a reminder, PPD Labs is comprised of a broad range of capabilities focused on drug development and organized into bioanalytical, GMP, vaccine and central labs. In order of magnitude, our GMP, BioA and vaccine lab together represents about 2/3 of our Laboratory business. Our GMP, BioA and vaccine labs are not reliant on sample volumes. Rather, the key drivers for these labs are staff availability and facility capacity. With respect to the central lab, we have seen disruption to sample volumes, but as sites reopen, we are seeing volumes recover. Lastly, PPD is one of the leading experts in infectious disease and vaccines, and this is underpinned by our 30-plus years of experience, which includes 15 FDA-approved vaccines and experience in over 300 infectious disease and vaccine trials. As a result, our labs are actively involved in a significant amount of COVID-19 work, which we expect to increase going forward. While the pandemic has no doubt presented challenges, our operations remain strong, our leaders and employees are adapting and we have and will find ways to ensure colleague and patient safety. I'll now turn it over to Chris Scully, our Chief Financial Officer, to review our financial results. Chris Scully : Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. In my prepared comments on today's call, I'll be covering our quarter one results; updating you on our cash, liquidity position and capital structure, given increased investor focus on balance sheets amidst the COVID-19 pandemic; and lastly, providing you with an update on our forward guidance before opening up for Q&A. Before diving in, as Nate mentioned, throughout my comments when referring to our P&L, I'll be doing so on an ASC 606 basis. To that end, as you likely saw in our earnings release and investor supplement, we've now migrated our segment disclosures to be in an ASC 606 basis, based on how we now manage the business and to reduce the administrative burden of having to maintain and reconcile two sets of books. When referring to other metrics such as net authorizations, backlog, net book-to-bill ratios and DSOS, these will currently remain on a historical ASC 605 basis to maintain comparability for investors. However, we have additionally included in our investor press release and our investor supplement these metrics on an ASC 606 basis, both with and without indirects. In addition, given the exceptional circumstances surrounding COVID-19, we have expanded the operational and financial metrics that we are providing on this call, along with sharing quarterly guidance for quarter two. That said, I'd like to note that we are unlikely to provide similar levels of disclosure on an ongoing basis post the pandemic. Turning to quarter one. As David noted, the first quarter was strong for us in terms of awards, in which we booked $1.06 billion in net authorizations, resulting in a net book-to-bill ratio of 1.30x and a record ending-backlog of $7.31 billion, which is up 11.9% from quarter one, 2019. Putting this in context, the 1.30x net book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was our highest book-to-bill ratio in eight quarters, significantly above the 1.20x that has historically translated into double-digit revenue growth based on our backlog conversion rates. As David and Bill both noted, during the quarter, we saw no unusual cancellation activity related to COVID-19. With respect to the P&L, quarter one revenue of $1.072 billion increased 11.3% over the first quarter of 2019 with strong contributions from both our Clinical Development Services segment, which grew 7.6%; and our Laboratory Services segment, which grew 30.6% year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $196.9 million increased 17.3% over the first quarter of 2019. Moving on to cash and liquidity. Let me begin by saying that through quarter one, we did not experience a negative impact to cash flow as a result of COVID-19. In fact, our DSO declined in quarter one, 2020 to 39 days as compared to 41 days in quarter one of 2019, and we saw further improvement in our AR aging profile versus prior year. I'd add, in our preliminary April results, we have seen no deterioration in any of these metrics. Rather, we've seen an increase in our cash collections and our cash balance versus March. While this is good news, it is not surprising to us, given the strength of our large biopharma and biotech customer balance sheets and what has remained a healthy funding environment. Further, as we've shared previously, approximately 80% of our biotech backlog is in Phase IIb or later studies, which tend to be lower risk and better funded than earlier stage assets. Despite these positive dynamics, out of an abundance of caution given the volatility in global markets, we drew down $150 million from our $300 million revolving credit facility and parked it as cash on our balance sheet. Inclusive of the revolver draw, we ended quarter one with cash and cash equivalents of $738 million, which is our largest quarter ending cash balance in over 10 years and equates to approximately four years of annual cash interest expense. I'd also point out that historically, our cash conversion is meaningfully lower during the first quarter of the year due to the payout of the annual incentive compensation awards. As a result, setting aside potential COVID-19 impacts, we would otherwise expect to see stronger cash flows in the quarter two through quarter four period as compared to the first quarter. With the above, we feel we are in strong shape in terms of our cash and liquidity position. Turning to the capital structure. On our last call, we had previously guided to reducing our net leverage ratio to the low 4s by the end of this year and into the 3s next year. We've made great progress towards this target with net leverage dropping from 6.9x pre-IPO at the start of the year to 4.7x immediately following the IPO and down to 4.5x as of quarter one. In addition, our capital structure has ample flexibility with our nearest maturity or material debt maturity not until August 2022, and we have only one covenant of note, which relates to our revolver, which states that net secured leverage can't be higher than 5.0x. As of quarter one, our actual net secured leverage ratio was 3.1x, which is almost 40% below this threshold. Put another way, if you hold our cash balance static, our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA would have to decline by approximately $300 million for us to trigger the covenant. Turning to forward-looking guidance. Given the uncertainties associated with COVID-19, we are withdrawing our full year guidance. However, to assist investors in understanding the near-term outlook, we are providing financial guidance for the next quarter on an exceptional basis on today's call. As you heard in David and Bill's remarks, the COVID-19 pandemic will have negative impacts from sponsor holds and disruption from the pandemic on patient enrollment, site start-up and monitoring in our Clinical segment and reduced samples volumes in our central labs. These impacts will be partially offset by revenues from faster burning COVID-19 awards and actions to manage our cost base, including the employee Choice program and executive pay freezes discussed earlier, slowdowns of nonessential hirings in areas where demand is reduced, lower employee travel expense and managing corporate costs and other actions. With that in mind, our second quarter two020 guidance is : revenues of $907 million to $946 million, which equates to a minus 9% to minus 5% decline versus quarter two of 2019; adjusted EBITDA of $170 million to $177 million, which equates to a minus 12% to a minus 8% decline versus quarter two of 2019 on an as-reported basis. So to wrap things up, quarter one was an exceptional quarter from both a commercial and financial perspective despite expanded COVID-19-related impacts in the second half of March. While we expect the impacts from the pandemic to increase in quarter two, our robust liquidity and extensive state of mitigation efforts have helped us to navigate the crisis to date and positions us well for strong growth post COVID-19. With that, I'll now hand over to the call back to the operator to open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson : Hi, good morning. I appreciate you're not giving full year guidance. But as we think about sites getting back up and reopened, I'm wondering if you could just give us some general parameters as to how you're thinking about number of sites that may be accessible in the back half of the year and by year-end? And how will Acurian help get \u2013 sites get back up and running faster? David Simmons : Yes. Thanks, Tycho, for the question. I'll start this, and then you may want Chris and Bill to comment on the two follow-up points of what we're looking at relative to financial impacts and then how we see Acurian and our site network through the year. So first, I'd say, it's a very difficult question because we don't know how the recovery is going to come, and we don't feel it would be prudent to try to project whether this is V shaped, U shaped or some other shape. We do think, and in our Q2 guidance, we have the impact that's at its most extreme form that we've faced thus far continuing through the second quarter. So that might be one point that helps. As we see sites coming back on, we probably have the most positive example based on what's happening in China. We don't forecast that Western Europe and U.S. will follow the speed of recovery that happened in China. Maybe that's conservative. In retrospect, we might look back and say it was conservative, but that's what we've currently planned. Let me see if Chris and then Bill want to add anything to that. Chris Scully : The only thing I would add is, I think, David, your comments apply to what we've forecasted for our quarter two kind of business. That doesn't mean operationally that we're not prepared to kind of accelerate kind of things if the pandemic's impacts are slower than that. Bill Sharbaugh : Yes. Tycho, this is Bill. As David mentioned, China is a comparator, but we're not sure it's the best comparator because activity has accelerated faster than we thought it would and forecasted it would. We've seen project initiations increase, IRB approvals increase, contract negotiations increase, site initiation visits increase, enrollments increasing, site audits are increasing. And based on our data and survey data we've seen suggests that they're back and sort of have recovered about 60%. Don't \u2013 as David said, don't expect the same necessary trajectory in Europe and in the U.S., but we are prepared. So from a resourcing perspective, we're in really good shape. So our site network, look, we think this is a good asset to have in our mix of services, and it can be used as a rescue mechanism for delayed studies, and we're in those kinds of conversations with customers. It's true it does have a fixed cost base associated with it that needs to be covered, but that's clearly offset by its strategic value and its use by customers and its uniqueness. So it's early days, but we think this is a good asset and part of the solution to help delayed clinical trials. Tycho Peterson : That's helpful. And then for the follow-up on the 2Q guidance, are you able to give us any color on clinical versus lab? How you're thinking about one versus the other? Chris Scully : Thanks for the question, Tycho. I think the answer to that is that we don't plan on giving specific guidance beyond what we have for the total company at the segment level. That said, per Bill's comments earlier on as well as some of the ones I made in the prepared comments for the call, we did kind of indicate that our clinical business is more greatly impacted than our labs business. So in our labs business, specifically, we have lower sample volumes in the central labs. However, that's less than 1/3 of the total business. BioA and GMP are impacted by less of a degree. It's likely that they're not going to continue to grow at the same rate that they had in quarter one, given it was a phenomenal growth rate. That said, we continue to expect for them to grow faster than the market. Tycho Peterson : Okay, thanks. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes, hi. Good morning. In the prepared remarks, you talked about the collaboration that you're seeing between you and clients and the FDA. So maybe if you can just kind of like give some more examples and color there. And also, as you think longer-term post COVID, what do you think of the \u2013 the FDA has been a lot more flexible. What do you think is going to stick post COVID? And if you think about the approach that clients have, clients that are bringing new RFPs on, are they starting to think kind of like longer-term beyond COVID of making changes and adding things as a result of what we're seeing now? David Simmons : The last part of the question, when you say adding things, could you be a little more specific? Ricky Goldwasser : Meaning, when we kind of talked in the past about RFPs, I think there was this sense that some of the remote monitoring capabilities, right, we're not as entrenched in those RFPs. So are you starting to see clients having conversations that think about how are we thinking about trial design post COVID or are all the conversation focused on the here and now? David Simmons : Okay. And that's also linked to the second part of the question around FDA flexibility. You're hitting on the same thing? Ricky Goldwasser : That's right. David Simmons : Okay. Let me take those two at the back, and then we'll see if we have some examples of collaboration that are going to hit the mark on this. So as we had in the prepared remarks, we do think that there'll be an accelerated adoption of virtual digital technologies into trials to be more patient-centric, to remove the burden on the patient, to be able to take more of the trial to the patient as opposed to the patient having to come to a physical infrastructure. The ability to do that is different across different therapeutic areas and different studies. So I wouldn't look at this as one big general statement. It's going to be very nuanced, but some studies do lend themselves towards more virtualization, if you can accept that term. So the way we look at it in terms of trying to sense the acceleration of adoption, you've hit on two of them. One is the regulators' posture towards adoption of these technologies and deviations to more status quo approaches to trial conduct. Second is readiness of the digital and virtual technologies to be applied to studies. Let me just tick that one off now. That looks really solid. The technologies work. They're able to go. So you give that one a box tick. And then the third that you hit on is clients' willingness to challenge the status quo and adopt these new technologies into the studies. So if I pick that off, let's go with customers first because the number of customer engagements that's been going on with us has not changed pre COVID and post COVID, meaning the volume of interactions we have are just as significant and robust as pre the crisis. They're just happening all over virtual technologies like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, WebEx, things like that. In those conversations, there is a dramatic increase in the volume of conversations around adapting these technologies into studies. Twofold. First is adopting the technologies and approaches into studies that are already actively in process in our backlog. We've got active conversations of changes to be considered being put in on 10% of the active studies that were running in our backlog. So that's a dramatic increase in volume of real discussions to modify the protocols to adopt these technologies. And the conversations have extended into future pipeline for the customers. So on that collaboration, I would give you that volume has increased dramatically from pre COVID to in the midst of COVID, and it's not just related to the COVID studies. It's also related to future pipeline. So that's one of the major reasons we said that we see an accelerated adoption. Now on the regulatory side, the regulators \u2013 and we're not just focused on the FDA. Regulators around the world have given guidance during the pandemic to help studies continue and to help patients continue to receive medicines, continue to participate in the studies because it may be part of the practice of care and be very important to them. So they're accepting deviations to the protocols to use these types of technologies. We've had cases of the Italian regulators, when the hospitals were overwhelmed, were allowing patients in a study that couldn't get into an investigator site that was burdened by COVID-19 treatment of patients to go to another site on the study that was not shut down due to COVID-19 treatments and continue the protocol there. So that's an example. It's not technology based. They also accepted the use of televisits for patient follow up. So that's an example of regulators leaning in. The big question we have, and we don't know the answer to is post pandemic, do the regulators continue to be embracing the use of these type of technologies or do they shift back to a more conservative approach of back to the status quo of trials. And that point, we don't know. But given all those three dimensions, customers have clearly leaned into this more and their appetite to apply these technologies is greater. Regulators have shown more flexibility during the pandemic, but the big question is, will they continue that post pandemic. Ricky Goldwasser : And just a quick follow-up there. Are there any \u2013 given the change in client appetite, are there any strategic assets that you think that are interesting for you to add to meet this change in appetite and demand? David Simmons : Not specifically. We're generally on the lookout beyond the partnerships and investments we have as we engage on specific trials and look at the right deployment of digital and virtual technologies onto each of these trials, how much are covered by partners we already work with on the technology and virtualization side. And as we see things that might be missing, and it's not always technology related. Some of it is also nontechnology related to be able to enable the trial going to the patient's home, for example. So we're keeping an eye on this and screening, but we don't have anything specifically that we think we need at this point. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jack Rogoff : Great, thanks for taking my question. This is Jack Rogoff on for Bob. Can you help us understand the 31% growth in the Lab segment? It sounded like a good amount of vaccine work and GMP capacity uptake. I'm curious how much of this was more of a lumpy pull forward of higher capacity build-outs versus more sustainable growth for you guys? Chris Scully : So this is Chris. I'll start with that and Bill may want to fill in some additional details beyond what I share. But quarter one growth in Labs was a result of a combination of favorable factors, including what we ended with last year is a really robust starting backlog. Second is the authorizations wins that we had in the current quarter. That led to faster expected customer utilization of some of the capacity expansions that we did last year. And we also benefited from major accelerations in a vaccines development program at one of our key customers. So it was a combination of multiple factors that went into it. I don't know if, Bill, you'd like to add something? Bill Sharbaugh : Yes. Maybe just to add some color to Chris' commentary. We've got a diverse set of laboratories. We think they are one, two or three in their respective niches. And we're a recognized leader in our labs. So your question was, is this lumpy? Well, we \u2013 in Q1, you can see our authorization results and Labs were certainly a big contributor to that, and we've had strong authorization growth. So look, we've added capacity, but we usually add capacity in a kind of a smart way. It's aligned with customer demand, but you have to build out enough capacity when you go the trouble and apply the CapEx to sustain you for a year or 2. So we certainly have enough capacity to grow, and we have a customer and market demand that suggests we're in a good space. We had an outstanding quarter in Q1, no doubt about it, but we feel good about our laboratory segment going forward. Jack Rogoff : Got it. That's helpful. And then are you expecting any change in your CapEx outlook this year? Or are things progressing as normal in this area? Chris Scully : Yes. We're not guiding specifically to where we'll end up in terms of CapEx for the year. We tend to be a business that's a little bit less capital-intensive than many others. So we've averaged around 4% of ASC 605 kind of sales per year, I think, a little bit below that on an ASC 606 basis. You may see us hold back slightly on some of these expenditures where we deem that they're nonessential given the pandemic and our desire to strengthen up liquidity. But we're going to continue to kind of invest at the same time where there's opportunities that we have a high degree of confidence or need and that are going to aid our customers. Jack Rogoff : Make sense. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dave Windley : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Good morning gentlemen. On \u2013 I wanted to get some follow-up on a comment that Bill has made a couple of times around China. You talked about \u2013 you gave us a litany of contracts, site activations, things like that. I'm wondering, since we kind of don't fully trust the data we see in the major kind of infection trackers. Are you seeing any spike in infection rate that would worry you that you would have to kind of retrench back into a more restricted environment in China? Or is that continuing to progress without inhibition? Bill Sharbaugh : Yes, Dave, I couldn't comment on the infection rate in China overall. I'll leave that to international health authorities in China. All I can do is tell you what we've seen in our business. This is an interesting factoid and makes me really happy, but none of our employees in China contracted the virus so far, which is amazing. And reviewing with our team the progress that's being made, I'm just suggesting that we're seeing activity resume in China. The metrics in the month of, recently have suggested that there's an uptick in activity in China. So that's positive, and we're going to see what happens. But I couldn't really comment on the infection rate in that country or anything of that nature. Dave Windley : Got it. I was just digging for, have you and your business had to rein back at any point in the last, say, couple of months, but it sounds like no. The second question that I wanted to explore was around your cost controls, which seemed pretty significant. I guess, quantitatively, I'm basically looking at a kind of 1Q to 2Q sequential decremental margin that is lower than your reported EBITDA margin in the first quarter. So kind of looks like you're reducing costs by more than 100% of your costs. And I hear you talking about putting capacity in place for COVID-related trials. You have a lab business that obviously has a fair amount of fixed capacity in it. And I just want to better understand where you're able to pull levers on cost to mitigate the impact to EBITDA as you go into 2Q? Chris Scully : Yes. Thanks, Dave. I'm not sure if we kind of look at the math the same way that you're looking at. As I kind of look at it, our margin improved slightly from I believe it's about 18.4% in quarter one to 18.7% next quarter. That does have embedded within it a fair degree of cost control. One thing you have to keep in mind is in terms of the staffing or the resourcing is to the extent that there are kind of colleagues that would not have demand if it weren't for COVID-19 awards, we're able, in large part, to kind of shift some of those bodies where they have the capabilities to support the COVID-19 kind of work. That's what David referred to in his section about basically people being cross-trained and really having a great degree of flexibility, which has been part and parcel of how we've been able to manage our cost base as tightly as we have the last several years. So that adaptability and flexibility definitely plays out favorably amidst a crisis like this. Dave Windley : Okay. But it does suggest that you're actually assuming greater productivity sequentially despite the disruption and having to shift people around. Bill Sharbaugh : Dave, this is Bill. I might answer it in this way. Look, personnel is the biggest cost in our business, right? And \u2013 given its nature, so utilization is key to us and we have a lot of capability here analytically and to control that. And to your point, given the current situation, there's a lot of tension between cost containment and the expected increase in demand. Look, we certainly slowed hiring. Our utilization is holding up pretty good. It's certainly not a target, as you would expect. And we have taken an approach of reallocating team members between projects and shifting team members between functions in some cases. And so overall, our priority is quality and ensuring that we can keep business continuity for customers and studies and patients. And so we're doing that through a variety of mechanisms, and we're poised as recovery occurs to take advantage of that. Now look, clearly, a lot of other drivers of cost, travel costs have gone way down, et cetera. David mentioned some activities in his commentary. And we've had employees who have voluntarily chosen to reduce their hours in the Choice program that David mentioned. So I mean, we have a lot of levers we're pulling on the cost side appropriately with the situation, but we are poised to recover. Dave Windley : Okay, thank you. Chris Scully : Yes. Just one other thing to add, Dave, on the question is, as you know, these are some complicated kind of businesses. So in addition to all those things, which we're doing to kind of manage some other factors could skew the percentages a little bit here and there, including the FX rates for the quarter, the ratio of indirects to directs, what we're kind of doing in our variable compensation. So a series of those things could also twist it. But basically, overall, I think the story is, is that, that this is a team that has a lot of experience in terms of managing utilization and staffing, and we do a great job at that, and this is not the first time we've been at it, and we're going to execute this really well in quarter two. Dave Windley : Excellent, thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from John Kreger of William Blair. Please go ahead. John Kreger : Hi, thanks very much. Can you tell us how well are the Phase I clinics holding up? I would think they're probably getting hit harder than some of your other areas. Bill Sharbaugh : Yes, John, this is Bill. Our Phase I clinics are part of our early development services business, which is in clinical. And so it's a subset of that broad category defined as early development. Look, we \u2013 what we did as the situation was developing in March. We finished out ongoing studies that were near completion for clients. We took a look at the situation. We decided to shut down that clinic. We furloughed some of the employees, and we thought that was the right thing to do because we didn't want to domicile healthy normal patients based on all the guidance from international, national and our local health authorities. So I would \u2013 we looked at the marketplace. We saw about half of those providing those services, kept them open and some reduced capacity and about half closed. We are in the camp of closing because we thought that was the right thing to do. So that's a subset of our business. We have clinics in Las Vegas, Nevada, in Austin, Texas and in Orlando, Florida. And we're in the process of planning for reopening, depending on how the virus progresses, but I would see us taking a phased approach where these open up at the end of Q2 for a small subset of studies, a whole bunch of new procedures put in place. And then through the course of Q3, ramp up and then be at full capacity in Q4. That's how we're sort of thinking of our Phase I clinics. There's a lot of detail around it, but our team has done an excellent job, and we think we've done the right thing as a company to protect both our staff and patients. David Simmons : John, it's David. One thing to add \u2013 one thing to emphasize what Bill said and then something to add. First thing to emphasize is that colleague and patient safety has come first. Of the three objectives that we're working on, if they ever come in conflict, colleague and patient safety wins. Hence, the very fast decision to shut down the clinics. That's the point I would emphasize, Bill brought up. The point I would add is that customer demand for these services is very strong. So customers are \u2013 keep asking us when are we going to be able to reopen the Phase I clinics. John Kreger : That's very helpful. And then a follow-up around the site network. I'm guessing the patient flow there is better than what you're seeing in sites that you don't own or manage. Any metrics that you could provide on that? I'm just curious how your site network patient volumes might have trended in the quarter compared to the other sites where you work? Bill Sharbaugh : Yes, John, this is Bill. So first of all, our site network has remained open, okay? Number one. Number two, ongoing clinical trials, many ongoing clinical trials have continued, albeit at a slower pace. And then some clinical trials have been put on hold by customers because they represented these at-risk patient populations that I mentioned earlier, immunocompromised patients or elderly patients. So it's a bit of a mixed bag there. The key thing is it has remained open, they are screening, recruiting and enrolling patients. And as I said, it's a rescue mechanism for ongoing clinical trials, and we're having discussions with customers around that right now. We put into place a couple of virtual solutions to help keep patients engaged and enrolled in those trials. Customers are very concerned about patients lost to follow-up. We've been able to maintain a lot of continuity there. So we have experienced some studies that are delayed to enrollment or paused on enrollment just because of the nature of those patients, but it's remained open, and many studies are continuing. So we think as recovery strengthens that our site network is going to be a great solution. And then those studies that are on pause are going to resume. John Kreger : Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Erin Wright of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead. Erin Wright : Great, thanks. Biotech funding, I would expect to be a little bit more volatile, obviously, in this environment. I mean, what are you seeing and hearing across that cohort of customers compared to large pharma? David Simmons : Thanks for that question, Erin. First, I'm going to say that biotech funding looks as robust as it's ever been in Q1. What we're seeing is funding from IPO and debt financing, probably off a little bit or flattish, but funding from venture capital increased in Q1. So the total was a very robust funding environment. So we're not seeing any signs of funding weakness on the biotech front. Second part is we continue to see cash on balance sheets of the funded biotech companies sitting at about two to three and trending to the three-year number in terms of cash on the balance sheet at current levels of R&D spending. So those are those two elements of the amount of capital flowing in and the amount of cash on balance sheets that the well-funded biotech companies are sitting on are both as strong as they've ever been. So that's the first point. The second is, I think, specific to PPD, I would bring out, which is in our backlog, if you look at the authorizations in our backlog from our biotech customers, approximately 80% of that award volume is for Phase II and later stage studies, which tend to be lower risk studies than the earlier stage biotech study. So you got an overall funding environment is strong and then the particular types of work we do in the later stages of development, which makes up on a dollar value, approximately 80% of our biotech backlog is relatively less risky. Erin Wright : Okay. Got it. And then you mentioned the success you're seeing in COVID-related business wins. How should we be thinking about how meaningful those are from a financial perspective? David Simmons : Yes. A couple of things to consider, as you think about them is, one, they're fast burning. So this is \u2013 tends to be revenue that's going to run this year and into 2021. So that's the first point. Second is, we think that the COVID book of work is dynamic meaning, you've got a lot \u2013 the industry has really responded rapidly and are doing a lot of testing of scientific hypothesis around COVID. And some are going to be good hypothesis that will get early data that's positive, and others will be not so good hypothesis. So I would expect with the awards that are coming in, some will cancel, some will expand. And we've already seen some expansions in the work we've won. So we mentioned 39 awards. Another way to think about this is that 39 awards, about 2/3 of those awards are for treatments, 1/3 of those awards are for vaccines. So the first and fastest kind of runs out of the blocks were the treatment programs, and those that had really good early data have already expanded scope. So another thing to think about is as you see awards, they're starting in the earlier stage. But if the data comes out very positively, you can see rapid expansions of these programs. An example of that is we had one treatment program that we were working on, where our original scoping was to enroll approximately 700 patients. Within four weeks and the early data readouts on that, the scope expansion went to well over 6,000 patients. I mean it's just a rapid and massive increase in scope. And Bill talked about our people going 24 hours a day, trying to make sure that we're able to enroll patients and get medicines to patients. That's actually tied to this specific example. Vaccines are lagging a little bit because it's being tested in healthy volunteers. But I would expect that the good vaccines programs are going to see scope expansion start to pop in Q2. Now the question is, you've got this double force, which early data readouts aren't going to be so positive, so there could be some cancellations or just the studies stop after that early stage. And then others where the data is positive is going to be relatively large scope expansions. And then because that's why we do these studies, it's hard to project what the volume is going to be in the future. Erin Wright : Great, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Juan Avendano of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Juan Avendano : Hi, thank you. Can you give us an update on the percentage of your overall patients that you are able to recruit from your site network? And also, what is the percentage of your sites that are exclusively dedicated to clinical research and thus potentially seeing a smaller impact from health care resources being diverted to COVID-19? David Simmons : I'm sorry, can I get the second part of your question again, Juan? Juan Avendano : Yes. And so what is the percentage of your overall sites that are exclusively dedicated to clinical research and thus potentially seeing a smaller impact from health care resources being diverted to COVID-19? David Simmons : Okay. I mean, we don't have the specific data to disclose on either of those fronts, but let me try to help with the questions. On the percent of patients related to our site network versus other site networks, say proportionality hasn't changed through this COVID-19 crisis, meaning the majority of patients are still flowing through the traditional site network versus the 180 sites we have. I would say that we, on our sites, while they're open and patients have been resilient, meaning patients are willing to participate in clinical trial conduct, the biggest factor affecting our own site network has been customer holds. Where if you flip and go to the traditional investigator sites, the biggest impact has been investigator sites as part of hospitals that are dealing with COVID-19 outbreaks. And there's severe impediments to our ability to do on-site activity, which Bill framed the proportionality in his opening comments. So you have this kind of different impact from COVID in our sites, which is more driven by customer holds in proportionality standpoint and zero impact on the sites being opened from the pandemic versus traditional sites, which are more impacted by the pandemic than from customer holds. So that would be, to try to help inform your question without disclosing the specific numbers you're asking for. Bill, is there anything you want to add to that? Bill Sharbaugh : No. I think you hit it. Juan Avendano : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Dan Brennan of UBS. Please go ahead. Dan Brennan : Thanks for taking the questions. David, you mentioned during the prepared remarks, that you think COVID could actually have a net positive impact on the overall R&D spend, I think, for biopharma. I was wondering in that context, a topic we've tried to think about is when we look out beyond 2020, the ability for CROs to [Audio Dip] So could you just speak a little bit about, maybe give a little more color on the overall level of R&D and COVID impact? And is there an ability, is there a slack capacity, whether it be at the sites, investigators or in CRAs to actually have an ability to catch up for what's been delayed? David Simmons : Yes. I think there's \u2013 you were getting cut off in the question, but I think the question had two parts is what was behind the statement of believing that this COVID experience will have a positive effect on R&D investment. And then I think your second question was around what \u2013 how do we see the complexity or challenge of catch-up once we get back to normalcy. So assuming that was the gist of the questions. So on the first piece, the statement on R&D investment levels is not a technically based feeling or belief. It's twofold. It's one, that I think with the pandemic going out, I think society is realizing that in the face of extreme health challenges or risks to health, where does one turn for solutions? And the innovative biopharma and biotech industries is the place that's mobilized on their own at speed and at pace and are having real impacts already. I mean, just if we look at remdesivir's approval and the amount of work going on. So one, I think since all the, maybe pre COVID, you may have seen just the general narrative out in the public being one that's more negative to the industry because of drug pricing and a political focus on drug pricing. I think society is probably seeing very clearly the role that this industry plays. So I think the belief and the importance of this industry to society is pronounced in this. That's the main driver behind the R&D investment levels. I think probably a sub chapter of that is maybe a renewed focus in public-private and what I believe would lead to a public-private discussion on infectious disease preparedness, which maybe was lacking a bit, heading into this. So that's the first piece on the R&D investment side. On the recovery side, this is a really tough topic, and it's one that we spend a lot of time on, and business by business within the total of PPD, it looks different. But fundamentally, we have to be prepared for different types of recovery curves, whether they be V shaped, U shaped or W shaped with reoccurrence of the pandemic. But we do believe that we're going to get back to a point where we're going to have to run whatever time period, let's say, it's fourth quarter. Again, we don't know what it's going to be. Let's say, fourth quarter, where we get back to the requirement where we've got to run the full expected book of work for that quarter that was planned. And then we have all of this catch-up work for delayed activities that have gone on. So resourcing becomes very, very important. And this is why we've been very loathe to take draconian actions on our cost base. Our leaders have done a great job adapting resourcing and reshifting resourcing to keep utilization as high as we can, but it has taken a bit of a knock. And this Choice program has been key. So people are managing their lives better, but we haven't given up that capacity, that flex capacity to come back in. But we do believe when that period of time hits where we have to do our normally planned volume of work and do the catch up work, that we're going to have to ramp up hiring. And the timing of the ramp-up of hiring at or in advance of this spike is something PPD does really well and calibrates really well. And we're going to have \u2013 this is going to test our ability probably unlike any other spike buildup that we've seen in the past. I just want to see if Bill wants to add anything to this. Bill Sharbaugh : Yes. David, I think you framed it quite well. I think the challenges aren't technical in nature. It's going to be access to sites, right? So access is a challenge. Clearly, there's new procedures that will be in place that various countries, institutions, et cetera, will put into place. And we and you will have to react to that so that our CRAs are prepared and able to enter those sites. And then it's the nature of our business. It's core. But clearly, there's a lot of protocol amendments that have been put in place around clinical trials as we've added digital services, as we're in a rescue mode, opening up new sites, catching up on activities that are required to be done at the site. We've done a lot of this work in advance, as I've said, to the extent we can to start-up a new clinical trial. But that's our bread and butter, those protocol amendments. And like David said, from a resourcing perspective, we're planning for recovery and ready for recovery. Dan Brennan : Great, thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Simmons for closing remarks. David Simmons : Yes. I want to thank everyone that participated in the call. We appreciate your time and allocation of time to PPD. As you can tell, we're very pleased with the quarter one results, but that's behind us now. Our full focus is on managing PPD and being part of the solution to this pandemic as we go through Q2 and into the rest of 2020. So again, thank you for your time, and we'll close the call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating, and have a pleasant day.",

So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our 2020 second quarter call. What an incredible quarter we just had. When we gave our update during our Q1 call, we provided our best thinking on our Q2 expectations in an environment no one had ever seen before. We were prepared for the most difficult quarter we've seen in the 18 years I've been with Thermo Fisher, and we successfully navigated the environment to deliver truly extraordinary performance. Our teams did a remarkable job of helping our customers respond to the pandemic. Their tireless effort and determination drove very strong results, generating material COVID-19 tailwinds, while minimizing the impact of customer disruption created by lockdowns around the world. Our performance in Q2 put a spotlight on the talent of our team, the advantage of our industry-leading scale and depth of capabilities, and the importance of our role in supporting our customers and society. We continuously built on our strengths. And what we've accomplished in the past few months shows that Thermo Fisher can perform extremely well, even in the most difficult circumstances. I know I\u2019ll always think back on this period as among our most -- our finest moments as a team and as a company. I look forward to covering some of the many highlights of the quarter with you this morning. So, I'll start with our financial results, which exceeded our expectations across the board. As you saw in our press release, our reported revenue increased 10% in Q2 year-over-year to $6.92 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 26% to $1.86 billion. And our adjusted operating margin increased to 27% in Q2, which was 350 basis points of expansion. Finally, we grew adjusted EPS by 28% to $3.89 per share in the quarter. We delivered such outstanding financial performance in Q2 because we worked with speed at scale, and quickly mobilized our resources to help our customers respond to the pandemic across the globe. Our solutions met their needs, generating approximately $1.3 billion of COVID revenue tailwinds. Our teams also did an excellent job of mitigating the headwinds in other parts of our Company. And we managed the Company aggressively and appropriately in a very fluid environment to set ourselves up for an even brighter future. Turning to our performance by end markets. Let me start with an overall comment for context. As you know, the pandemic has generated both, significant headwinds and tailwinds in our industry. And this impacted each of our end markets to varying degrees. On one hand, we saw greatly reduced customer activity due to work disruptions; and on the other, we benefited significantly from our COVID-19 response. We managed the Company very effectively through this dynamic to deliver an exceptional quarter. So, starting with pharma and biotech, the largest of our four end markets. It was another great quarter and we continued to perform very well here in Q2, growing just under 10%. We had particularly strong performance in our bioproduction and pharma services businesses. Turning to industrial and applied. We saw a decline of just over 10% in Q2, while in academic and government we declined approximately 20%. Customers in these two end markets were significantly affected by business disruptions during the quarter due to the pandemic. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare. While we saw significant headwinds in this market due to a decrease in doctor visits and related testing, we met the incredible demand for COVID-19 testing and were able to deliver growth of just over 70% in Q2. We're providing customers with our proprietary diagnostic test kits, instrumentation and viral transport media, as well as reagents used for laboratory developed tests. And I'll talk more about our involvement later in my remarks. To wrap up our end market commentary, our teams put forth an amazing effort supporting our customers and meeting the societal response of the pandemic, while effectively managing the Company to deliver outstanding growth in Q2. Turning to the business highlights for the quarter. On our Q1 call, I departed from my typical agenda bit and talked about the three guiding principles we're following to manage through these unprecedented times. To remind you, the first is ensuring the safety of our colleagues; our second guiding principle is to maintain business continuity, so we can continue to support our customers, whether they're directly responding to the pandemic or continuing their work more broadly; and third, we manage our Company appropriately, so we come out of this period an even stronger industry leader. As I reflect on Q2, those guiding principles have served us very well. We've successfully implemented numerous safety protocols at our sites that has kept our business running so we can continue to serve our customers at a time when they need us most. Let me focus today on the last guiding principle, managing the Company appropriately. And to reiterate, it's a combination of relentless focus on executing a long-term growth strategy while ensuring that we successfully navigate the short-term challenges and generate new opportunities as well. During this time, we've been carefully managing costs while confidently investing to position the business for long-term share gain and accelerated growth. This includes continuing to invest in key R&D programs, even in parts of the business where demand is temporarily impacted. For example, we had a great showing at the virtual American Society of Mass Spectrometry conference in June, where we launched two new Orbitrap Exploris instruments to advance biotherapeutic research. These types of investments across our businesses will position us well to capture the opportunities as customer activity returns to more normal levels. The second quarter reinforced why we're recognized as a world leader in serving science. I've been overwhelmed by the outreach we've had from the most senior government officials around the globe, to the leaders of healthcare institutions, to the top executives of the world's largest companies. They\u2019re all navigating challenges never experienced before, whether they're protecting the safety of their own workforce or communities managing the incredible volume of testing with trying to understand the virus, to identify therapies and accelerate the development of vaccines. We are in the best position to help them meet these challenges because we remain focused on executing our growth strategy by continuously innovating, leveraging our scale and enhancing our unique customer value proposition. We're involved in virtually every aspect of the pandemic response from providing research tools, to personal protective equipment, to diagnostics, as well as supporting the development and production of therapies and vaccines. Our mission is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer, and it highlights the critical role we play. This morning, I'm going to focus on the two most prominent aspects of our involvement, diagnostic testing, and the development and manufacturing of vaccines and therapeutics. First, testing. It was an exceptional quarter for us, given the role we play in COVID-19 diagnostics. We created a major business line in a few months and have continued to expand our capabilities. I'll cover just some of the highlights. As you know, our industry-leading PCR franchise has always played a role in our customers' ability to provide lab developed tests. And our reagents and consumables support many COVID-19 tests in use around the world. But our role significantly expanded when we received regulatory approvals back in March for our TaqPath COVID-19 combo kit. Our PCR-based workflow is widely used in 50 countries. And these tests are considered the gold standard, given their high level of accuracy. April was all about ramping up manufacturing and helping getting our customers to get their labs ready to handle the significant volume of testing. Our teams rapidly scaled production at an incredible pace, and we ended the quarter with enough capacity to produce more than 10 million tests per week, should our customers need that level of testing. Our field services team and application specialists did a remarkable job of getting our customers ramped up to COVID-19 testing. In May, we received an expanded emergency use authorization or EUA from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that allowed more of our PCR instruments to run these tests to help address the huge demand. The EUA also provided more options for reagents and consumables, which provides customers with greater flexibility in testing workflow. The overwhelming demand for testing created significant strain on the industry's supply of sample collection materials. The swabs, vials and media needed to effectively collect and transport the specimen to a testing lab for processing. The U.S. government came to us for help. And given our understanding of the challenge, we worked with them to significantly ramp up production of highly specialized viral transport media or VTM, to address this need. VTM is critical to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 test results, and must be manufactured and dispensed into vials in an aseptic environment. We designed and built a new factory in Lenexa, Kansas in about six weeks, and we produced our first VTM vials at this new facility on the July 4, the exact date we set out in our ambitious project plan. This was a very exciting accomplishment for our teams. Whether it was in Lenexa or all of the other ramp-up projects related to COVID, our industry-leading scale and the power of our PPI business system were key enablers in achieving these milestones in such a short period of time, while managing enormous complexity and meeting all the regulatory requirements. Looking forward, in addition to our PCR-based TaqPath kit, which determines if a patient has an active infection, we plan on launching additional tests. We're developing a serological test that can tell if a patient has ever been exposed to the virus. And in addition, we're developing a respiratory panel to help doctors determine whether a person has COVID-19 or different respiratory disease. And our goal is to launch this panel as of the flu season. We're working through the regulatory processes to make both of these tests available to customers globally. The other significant aspect of our involvement is the work we're doing to support our pharma and biotech customers in the ways to launch COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines. As you know, we're a leader in the development and production of vaccines, antivirals and other therapies through our pharma services business. And we're currently working on more than 200 COVID-related projects globally. We're leveraging our global network to support governments and customers as they accelerate these projects, including some that are undergoing human clinical trials, by providing critical capacity and expertise to get new products to market and ultimately to patients. To give you one example, we're playing a key role in the U.S. government's pandemic countermeasure program, managed by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, better known as BARDA. We received funding to support the expansion of our manufacturing capacity for sterile injectables, which can be used to fill a high volume of vaccine doses. In addition, we're expanding capacity for customers who are developing COVID-19 therapies, including promising antivirals to compress timelines to meet the expected surge in demand. While we continue to increase our support of the pandemic response, we're also expanding our pharma services capacity globally to ensure that we can deliver critical medicines for treating a range of serious health conditions. I'll highlight two examples from the quarter. One is the new site we're building in Plainville, Massachusetts, which will essentially double our viral vector manufacturing capacity. This is another in our series of expansions in the U.S. that will help us meet demand for the development and production of gene therapies. The other development is our strategic partnership with CSL, the global biotech company to help to meet high demand for biologics. We will support CSL's product portfolio by leveraging our entire network, including drug development, production, packaging and clinical trials. And under a long-term agreement, we will also take over CSL's state-of-the-art biologics facility in Lengnau, Switzerland, which is currently under construction and expected to be completed in the 2021. This site will feature both, high-volume stainless steel and highly flexible single-use bioproduction technologies, and our plan is just to expand its use to support a number of customers. All of these strategic investments will ensure that we can deliver on our value proposition for pharma and biotech customers through a powerful combination of expertise, flexibility and scale. Turning now to capital deployment, I'll make a couple of comments on pending acquisition of Qiagen. As you saw in our press release last Thursday, we announced that we renegotiated certain aspects of our acquisition agreement. Given the considerable changes in industry dynamics since we originally announced the transaction in early March, we revised our offer. Qiagen is making a significant contribution to the global pandemic response, and we believe our new all-cash offer of \u20ac43 per share, reflects the full and fair value of the business in the current environment, while generating strong returns for both sets of shareholders. We're very excited about this transaction. We look forward to bringing together our complementary offerings to help our customers fight the ongoing pandemic and combat other infectious diseases and emerging health needs. For our shareholders, we expect strong returns and believe that the accretion will be slightly more favorable than what we articulated in early March. While there is still much of work to be done over the next several months, we're on track with the regulatory process and expect to complete the transaction in the first half of 2021. Qiagen is an excellent fit for our Company, and we're excited about the new opportunities we'll have following the close. Now, I'll make a quick comment on guidance. As you know, we withdrew our 2020 annual guidance in early April due to the uncertainty around the pandemic and its potential impact on our customers. Now, here we are in late July, and it's obviously still a very uncertain time. Similar to Q1, while we're not ready to reinstate annual guidance, we want to provide you with as much color as possible on our expectations for the current quarter. Stephen will review the specifics in his remarks, including our organic growth expectations and key assumptions for Q3. Before I turn the call to Stephen, let me leave you with a few takeaways. We're playing a significant role in helping our customers to respond to the pandemic and making a huge impact on society. Our teams are managing the business very well through this unprecedented time to mitigate the headwinds and create new opportunities. We're continuing to execute our growth strategy to position Thermo Fisher for an even brighter future. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by framing our Q2 organic growth performance. As Marc mentioned, we had an outstanding quarter and we grew organically 11%. I think, it is best to break the growth into two elements. The first is the scale of the COVID-19-related revenue tailwinds that we generated during the quarter; and the second is the performance of the rest of our business, including share gain and market growth, as well as the headwinds from COVID-19 caused by disruptions to customer activity. We estimate that the tailwinds from COVID-19 were approximately $1.3 billion or 21% of growth in the quarter, largely driven by testing-related kits and instruments. The tailwinds were significantly stronger than we originally expected, driven by the increased scale and duration of the pandemic, and the speed at which we were able to ramp up our response and extend our relevant offerings to our customers. The rest of the business, excluding the COVID-19 tailwinds performed just about the high end of our initial range of expectations for the quarter. The team executed really well to serve all of our customers throughout Q2. The result is that we delivered outstanding top-line growth in the quarter. We are able to manage the Company very effectively during a period of significant economic disruption and translate that top line growth into excellent bottom line growth. We appropriately managed the businesses with the strongest headwinds while maximizing the tailwind opportunities and continuing to invest for really bright future. All of this enabled us to deliver 26% growth in adjusted operating income and 28% growth in adjusted earnings per share, an excellent quarter overall. I'll now give you some more details of the second quarter results for the total Company, then provide some color on our four segments and conclude with some comments around guidance. Starting with our Q2 earnings results. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS 28% to $3.89; GAAP EPS in the quarter was $2.90, up 5% from Q2 last year. On the top line, our Q2 reported revenue grew 10% year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue increase included 11% organic growth and the foreign exchange headwind of approximately 1%. Turning to our growth by geography during the quarter. North America grew 10%, Europe grew in the high teens, Asia Pacific was flat with China down approximately 15%, and the Rest of the World grew 50%. Looking at our operational performance. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 26% and adjusted operating margin was 27%, 350 basis points higher than Q2 last year. We saw very strong volume contributions, positive business mix and continued productivity investments -- improvements driven by our PPI business system, including appropriate cost controls, given the headwinds from COVID-19. During the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments in the businesses. This was the last quarter of impact from our divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business, which we sold at the end of Q2 2019. The divestiture was approximately $0.02 diluted in the quarter and was a year-over-year headwind of approximately $50 million on revenue, $12 million on just the adjusted operating income and a negligible impact on adjusted operating margin. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total Company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 50.6%, up 390 basis points from Q2 of the prior year. Gross margin expansion was driven by the same factors as our adjusted operating margin expansion. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 19.9% of revenue, an increase of 50 basis points versus Q2 2019. Total R&D expense came in at 3.8% of revenue. And R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q2 was 5.6%. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter. Our net interest expense was $129 million, $8 million higher than Q2 last year. Adjusted other income and expense was net income in the quarter of $16 million, similar to Q2 2019. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 11.5%, up 50 basis points versus Q2 last year. And average diluted shares were 398 million in Q2, 5 million lower year-over-year driven by the net impact of share repurchases and option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations was very strong in the first half of the year, totaling $2.2 billion and free cash flow was $1.7 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of approximately $500 million. We returned approximately $85 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This reflects the 16% dividend increase we announced in February. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.8 billion in cash and $21.3 billion of total debt as we prepare for the financing of the Qiagen acquisition. During the quarter, we raised \u20ac1.2 billion through the issuance of euro-denominated senior notes. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.1 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.2 times on a net debt basis. And wrapping up my comments on our total Company performance. Adjusted ROIC was 12.5%, up 110 basis points from Q2 last year, as we continue to generate very strong returns. So, now, I\u2019ll prove some color on the performance of our four business segments. I thought it'd be helpful to start with a couple of framing comments around the impact of segment results. The complexity here shows the breadth of our response to meet the needs of our customers at this critical time. From a revenue standpoint in Q2, approximately three quarters of the COVID-19 tailwinds are reflected in Life Sciences Solutions. That includes testing related kits, instruments and sample preparations. This is recognized in our genetic sciences and biosciences businesses.  The Specialty Diagnostics segments include the revenue and the clinical diagnostics business from the molecular controls that go into testing kits. We also recognized sales of viral transport media and the microbiology business, as well as sales of tests and PPEs by the healthcare market channel. The Laboratory Products and Services segment also includes revenue from sales of PPE recorded in the research and taking market channels. In addition, this segment includes testing workflow-related plastics made by our lab products business, and vaccine and therapy development and production support from our pharma services business. From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 was varied across the segments. The impact depended on the mix of revenue tailwinds and headwinds, as well as the different levels of pull through on that revenue mix. Across the Company, we used our PPI business system to manage cost appropriately given the uncertain environment, and that had a positive impact in each segment. At the same time, during the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments in our businesses, even in those where COVID-19 was a net headwind. This included investments in our colleagues in terms of incentive compensation and recognition, as well as commercial, R&D and production capability investments. We were able to do this given the strength of the Company's overall performance. Those investments do not necessarily match with the COVID-19-related revenue tailwinds and headwinds in each segment, so that does skew some of the reported margins in the segments. So, a lot of moving parts from a segment standpoint but all reflective of very active management of the Company, allowing us to navigate successfully through unprecedented times and positioning us really well for the future. So, moving on to the segment detail, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. In Q2, reported revenue in this segment increased 52% and organic revenue growth was 55%, driven by exceptionally strong growth in our genetic sciences business as well as continued strong growth in bioproduction and biosciences businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 103% and adjusted operating margin was 47.4%, up 12 percentage points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull-through and productivity as positive business mix and continued to make significant strategic investments across the segment. The Analytical Instruments segment reported a revenue decrease of 21% in Q2 and organic revenue decline of 20%. COVID-19 disruption to our customers continues to have a significant impact to the business in this segment. Q2 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments decreased 53% and adjusted operating margin was 12.9%, down 870 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw a very strong productivity driven by our PPI activities, which was more than offset by volume headwinds, business mix and the strategic investments that I mentioned earlier. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segments. As a reminder, this is the segment that previously included the anatomical pathology business, which we sold in June last year. In Q2, reported revenue increased by 5%, organic revenue growth was 12%. Some of the businesses in this segment were significantly impacted by COVID-19-related headwinds in the quarter. This was as a result of decrease in doctor visits and related testing. Most impacted were the immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. That said, this segment also saw a significant COVID-19-related tailwinds in the quarter. We saw very strong growth in our healthcare market channel and our clinical diagnostics and microbiology businesses. Adjusted operating income decreased 12%, which included a 5% headwind from the divestiture. Adjusted operating margin was 21.6%, down 410 basis points from the prior year. In the quarter, we saw a strong volume leverage in productivity. However, this was more than offset by business mix and strategic investments. Finally, in Laboratory Products and Services segments, Q2 reported revenue increased 6% and organic growth was 5%. In the quarter, growth within the segment was led by our pharma services. Adjusted operating income in the segment for Q2 decreased 19% and adjusted operating margin was 10.1%, which was lower than the prior year by 300 basis points. In the quarter, we saw a strong productivity and volume leverage. So, this was more than offset by unfavorable business mix and the strategic investments that I mentioned earlier. Turning to guidance. The COVID-19 pandemic and related customer impact continues to evolve. And as a result, we're still not in a position to provide full year detailed guidance. However, as we did last quarter, I will provide you with some color on how we're viewing organic growth for the coming quarter as well as certain full year 2020 assumptions to help you in your modeling. I'll start with organic growth. Our current estimate of the most likely outcome for Q3 organic growth is approximately 15%. There are potential outcomes, both above and below the 15% that could play out in Q3. I will outline of the factors to consider when thinking about our potential growth for the coming quarter. As was the case last quarter, there are two key variables that would drive our growth in Q3. The first is the scale of the COVID-19-related revenue tailwinds; the second is the headwind caused by COVID-19-related disruption to our customers\u2019 activity. Regarding the revenue tailwinds, clearly there is a wide range of outcomes here. But, our current estimate of the most likely outcome for Q3 is approximately $1.1 billion of revenue, which would translate to just under 18% of growth. The volume of COVID-19 testing undertaken by our customers will be the most significant factor, determining the expense of our revenue tailwinds in Q3. Regarding the rest of our revenue growth, which is a combination of the COVID-19-related headwinds, underlying market growth, and our share gain activity, we estimate this will be in the range of approximately flat to negative 5% in Q3. This compares to negative 10% in Q2. The improvement quarter-over-quarter is driven by an assumed gradual ramp in customer activity. As they return more fully to the workplace. It's important to note that the range does not anticipate to return to the lockdowns seen at the height of the pandemic. So, when you put all this together, as I mentioned our current best estimate of Q3 organic growth is approximately 15%. Given the fluidity of the situation, there are potential outcomes, both above and below the 15% that could play out in Q3 with testing demand being the most significant swing factor. I will now move on to an update of some of the modeling elements for the full year. With regards to FX, in 2020, we\u2019re now assuming that this is a year-over-year headwind on revenue of $200 million or just under 1%. There's $0.06 of dilution from the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business, which reflects revenue and operating income headwinds of $105 million and $30 million, respectively. We\u2019re continuing to assume that the acquisitions we completed in 2019 will contribute approximately $160 million to our reported revenue growth in 2020. As a reminder, on the calendar, it was one less day in Q1 and there will be two extra days in Q4 this year. We continue to expect net interest cost for the year to be approximately $460 million. This includes the Qiagen acquisition pre-funding completed to-date. In 2020, that equates to a cost of $90 million or $0.17 to adjusted earnings per share. We will continue to look at opportunities to prefund more of the transaction during the remainder of 2020. We continue to assume that adjusted other net income will be about $70 million for the year. And with regards to net capital expenditures, we now expect to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. This includes approximately $300 million of capital expenditure to support our COVID-19 response. In terms of capital deployment, we completed $1.5 billion of share buybacks in Q1 and are assuming no further buybacks in the remainder of 2020. We estimate that full year average diluted share count will be between 398 million and 400 million shares. And we continue to assume that we\u2019ll return approximately $350 million for capital to shareholders this year through dividends. So to wrap up, as you can see from our outstanding performance in Q2, we continue to manage the Company extremely effectively in a very dynamic environment. With that I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth Apicerno : Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. Congrats on the quarter. I appreciate you guys kind of quantifying the COVID tailwinds. I think, as we look a little bit further out in securities market, how you think about the durability on the COVID testing side? You noted the PCR test is now approved and other instruments. You talked about the respiratory panel. So, can you talk a little bit about is that a move forward more automated systems, rolling it into the syndromic panel? And do you need to build out more of a panel for example, into the physician office market? Thanks. Marc Casper : Yes. Tycho, thanks for the question. As I look to the COVID -- impact of COVID going forward, the largest determinant this year and the impact is going to be related to the testing demand. And certainly, as you get into 2021, you're going to see a larger and larger impact of the activities we do in our pharma services business to support the therapy and vaccine development and ramp up, or we get some of that now. When I look at the going forward for COVID-19 testing, we obviously have a leading position in PCR platform. Around the world, our response has been a very significant ramp-up in capacity. And we anticipate that the demand certainly in Q3 will continue to be at a very strong level. And, most of us are obviously very dominated by U.S. headlines, but what you see is generally demand picking up further in the U.S. but you also see demand weakening in other geographies. Europe, we have lower demand as you saw in Q2. That may change. But the net of it is fairly similar revenues to what we saw in Q2 is what we're expecting for Q3. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then, two follow-ups on Patheon. You had the press release out the other day quantifying 200 programs you're involved with. Can you just help us think about the trial delay headwinds versus the tailwinds on vaccine development for the next couple of quarters? How we should think about the trajectory for Patheon? And then, separately on China down 15%, was that in line with your expectations? Obviously, you've been on the path to recovery. So, that was a little bit worse than these models? Thanks. Marc Casper : Yes. So, in terms of the pharma services activity, we're very involved with a very large number of programs. And when I look at sort of the headwinds from the pandemic on clinical trials, outside of the COVID, there was some, but not meaningful. And when I look to China at a high level, we saw demand build throughout the quarter, in terms of where we were. And the way that I would think about is, China was very, very conservative on the opening up of academic institutions. So, that actually was a little bit more muted than what we would have expected back in April. But it's picking up in Q3. It looks to be more encouraging. Thank you, Tycho. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Maybe to follow up on the prior question. Marc, can you perhaps size what the vaccine opportunity could mean for the overall life science industry? I understand, at some point, diagnostics could drop off. We've heard a multibillion dollar figure for the industry. I'm just curious on -- just given the scale of the vaccine opportunity we\u2019re thinking, should that perhaps be over time larger than the diagnostic opportunity? Marc Casper : When I think about the vaccine opportunity, what's a little bit hard to quantify is what's the vaccine strategy going to be used around the world? So, I'm talking more what's the total amount of vaccine going to be produced? Are we thinking about the world getting high-risk population, are we thinking about the just the countries that can afford a vaccine, or we thinking about 7 billion people ultimately getting a vaccine? And that leads to a massively wide range of what the outcomes are. What I would expect, should there be a successful vaccine, is that, the role of a company like Thermo Fisher and certainly the CDMO industry more generally will play a significant role, based on the fact that the ramp-up under every scenario would be very dramatic. We've been very-active in those projects and many of the high-profile projects that you read about. We are either providing raw materials from our bioproduction or biosciences business to having roles in the production ultimately of what I'll call drug substance or vaccine substance in certain cases, and certainly a very meaningful role in the sterile fill-finish with a final packaging form that a vaccine would be administered. So, we expect if a vaccine is successful that it will be a meaningful tailwind over time with revenue that we've already gotten a little bit of and ramp slowly through the balance of this year and would be more meaningful in 2021-2022 should the vaccine be successful. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And then, one on margin, in the guidance for the back half. I think, you guys mentioned, perhaps the organization was prepped up for a pretty drastic outcome. So, clearly, you had outsized volume benefits. So, when you think about the incremental margins for back half, should we think about some of that spend coming back perhaps in the incremental margins, maybe tempering down a little bit? And I'm curious why perhaps we don't have an EPS floor, even if we assume Q4 to be all of the diagnostics tailwinds. So, it still seems the EPS projections here should be pretty strong. Thank you. Stephen Williamson : Yes. So, Vijay, I'll take that one. So, when you think about Q2, 11% organic growth drove 28% growth in adjusted EPS. So, it's a very strong performance. So you think about Q3, and most likely outcome based on what we\u2019re thinking right now is 15% organic growth and that would drive very strong adjusted EPS as well. I think about Q3 to Q2, kind of the change in the mix of the business in the 15% versus the 11%. It's likely to be slightly less favorable business mix within that revenue. Obviously, this is scenario where that mix could play out to better, but I think that's a good place, a good way to think about modeling for Q3. Vijay Kumar : And then, on the EPS floor perhaps, even if we assume all of diagnostics just went away for Q4, I feel like EPS should be certainly in the double-digit range for the year, perhaps in the mid-teens. Is that a reasonable assumption now for the year? Marc Casper : So, we chose not to give the full year guidance because when you think about the potential mix and range of growth in each segment, to give a raise that would be useful, the number would be enormously wide. So, what we are looking at is, as we get more predictability into what the world looks like, especially in Q4 where you don't know what the virus looks like, you could have a very bullish scenario. You could actually have a pessimistic scenario, if there was a dramatic -- this current wave gets much worse, you could be more pessimistic. So, we're keeping our thinking on what the right external approach is. We feel good about our outline for Q3. And I think you've got a sense from our Q2 performance, we're going to deliver an outstanding year financially and it'll be managing through whatever environment is thrown at us, we're going to create great opportunities to drive share gains, top-line growth and extraordinary earnings performance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin : Hi. Good morning, everyone. So, a couple of questions. I think the first one is, I appreciate the color on Q3. I think, where we're getting most of our incoming questions for investors is how do we think about the COVID testing tailwinds going on into \u201821? I mean, Qiagen has put out commentary, talking about double-digit growth in their business, but then decline in 2022 numbers, if you look at the documents filed this morning. I guess, could you just sort of talk about how we do this? Because we obviously -- if you think about modeling for \u201821, I know it's given testing coming down, vaccine production going up like that. But, I think that that's sort of where the bulk of my incoming questions are from people. Marc Casper : So, Derik, thanks for the question. Let me tell you how we're planning. That's probably -- it's impossible to predict in a certain way. It feels like a month as far as these days. But, what we're expecting from everything we know is that we're going to be living with the pandemic for a number of quarters. It'll take time for a vaccine to be in the market if it's successful. Well, therapies are making progress again that these will take time and that the virus continues to spread in many countries around the world. So, that this is not a, it's done quickly scenario. And therefore, we're expecting that 2021, we\u2019ll be navigating through both, headwinds of disruptions of some sort related to the pandemic, but also the continued societal response needed to that. And we think we're incredibly well-positioned, based on our quality, scalability of manufacturing and very large installed base and very exquisite customer relationships. We feel good about that will play a meaningful role in 2021 for the testing volumes that are needed by customers. And what that number is going to be, is a very, very enormous range of outcomes. But our manufacturing teams have been remarkable and the power of our PPI business system has been astonishing. And if you think back, when I was at the White House at the end of April, I said that we're working our way to be able to produce 10 million kits a week. And that was late April. And by the end of the quarter, our manufacturing capacity is about that. And that doesn't mean we're selling them any because demand will ebb and flow, but our ability to scale and meet whatever response is out there, we feel highly confident in that. Derik de Bruin : Great. And could you talk a little bit more about the academic outlook? I mean, you've got a fairly big chunk of your business tied to academic and university and colleges. And clearly there's a lot of uncertainty to deal with this resurgence about how these are going to open. Can you walk us through academic and government as we look at U.S, Europe, APAC and just to get a sense on what your customers are planning and how labs are, -- how many of your labs you still closed? Just I think some general color. I think that's the other number one -- that's the other big incoming question we have from investors. Marc Casper : Yes. So, in terms of academic and government end market, you obviously saw disruptions around the world at the beginning of the pandemic with activity very quickly ramping down. As you look at Western Europe, which actually started to strengthen steadily throughout the quarter. The U.S. which faced the pandemic slightly later than Europe is a little behind, but on the same type of trajectory with activity picking up. The interesting country has really been China, was -- actually kept most of its universities closed for most of the quarter. That activity is picking up as well, but actually a little bit more slowly than one would anticipate -- one would have anticipated. So the impact of that is obviously, they weren\u2019t customers able to receive instruments as easily as normal. And so, we would expect that as academic and government customers reopen in that setting, you'll see instruments demand start to pick up as well. Derik de Bruin : Great. I'll get back into Thank you. Marc Casper : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Marc Casper : Good morning. Jack Meehan : Marc, I was curious to get your take on how much the tailwind and share gains that you're seeing in the business right now. Do you think we're going to end up proving to be more permanent over time versus kind of the outsized benefit you're seeing right now? And I know it's difficult to provide a three-year view when we don't have a one year view. But just given all the moving parts, how do you think your position versus the 5% to 7% target you laid out a year ago? Marc Casper : Yes. So Jack, when the team\u2019s view, right, when we were sitting in February and looking at the situation in China, the team's view was having a very clear set of guiding principles, right, which was the obvious. Keep your colleagues safe, support your customers activity, and the third is manage the Company appropriately in this environment. And we came with a very clear view of what that meant, which is, of course, manage costs tightly because there's going to be disruption to demand, but be very aggressive to position the Company for a brighter future to solidify and strengthen and hopefully even increase the growth outlook of the Company for the longer term. Normal for us is 5% to 7% growth, and we've been taking actions to create an even brighter future. So, we need to get higher in that range when you're in a normal environment or above that range. And we have no idea now. But I know we're taking the actions to strengthen the long-term outlook of the Company. And because we've been able to respond so aggressively to help our customers navigate the pandemic, we're obviously in the midst of an incredibly strong year as well. So, we're -- at this point, obviously we had about 7% organic growth when you look at the first half, so at the high end of our normal range. And obviously with the Q3, this could be a very significant year as well in terms of performance. Jack Meehan : Okay. And then, I wanted to also follow up on Qiagen. Clearly unprecedented times, so I can appreciate the justification for the price increase. There have been some questions around whether \u20ac43 is enough. So, I was just hoping you could comment on your appetite or lack thereof to raise the price further? And just walk us through what happens next in the tender process. Marc Casper : Yes. So, Jack, thanks for the question. As everybody here knows, we're extraordinarily disciplined in terms of our capital deployment strategy and ensuring that where we deploy our capital, we're going to strengthen the Company strategically and generate strong returns for our shareholders. The dynamics are obviously, as you said, very different, from the beginning of March to now. And Qiagen has done a good job in terms of stepping up and making a real impact on society from a pandemic response. And we thought our way through that and had very good negotiations with Qiagen and came to an agreement at the \u20ac43. And we believe that's the full and fair value. In terms of our view is, we were very clear in the process, and we disclosed that this morning, I think early hours because of the German regulations. That is our best and final offer. And the process is very straightforward. The tender I believe ends around August 10th. And if we clear the 66.67% threshold, then the tender is complete, so mechanism and the deal proceeds. And if we don't get to 66.67%, the deal is over, because there's a cooling off period in Germany. So, there is no revised offer. That is what it is. And, we think it's very appropriate for both sets of shareholders. And we look forward to completing the tender process and then moving forward through the regulatory process and welcoming over 5,000 new colleagues next year into the Company. Jack Meehan : Makes sense. Thanks Marc. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Your line is open. Doug Schenkel : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. And again, thanks to the Thermo team for all your efforts over the past several months. Just in terms of my first question, what end market expectations are embedded into your Q3 financial targets, excluding COVID-19 tailwinds? Marc Casper : It's not a way that we manage the business quite, Doug. Let me try to get you an answer more about activity levels in the non-COVID, and make some qualitative views around it. So, for Q2 Doug, the non-COVID related businesses declined 10%, right, which was just above what the better end of our expectations that we gave in the guidance process, right? So, that's where it ended. June was down about 5%. So, you saw, April, May were worse. June was about negative five. The range of outcomes that Stephen articulated in the outlook for Q3 was a range of negative 5 to flat. The negative 5 would assume that what we saw in June continues throughout the quarter. The flat basically is a steady improvement throughout the quarter. And when you think about that in normal quarter for us is 5% to 7% growth on that business, right? So, even at flat, you're still 5 to 7 points below what we would have experienced for the last five, seven years, right? So, it's a steady increase in activity is what is assumed. And when you look at that on the non-COVID-related businesses, pharma biotech has continued to be the least impacted and would likely be the least impacted, and academic and government, industrial and applied, and the healthcare, diagnostics, they all should start to see some level of step up throughout the quarter is the way I would think about it. Doug Schenkel : Okay. That's super helpful. And building off of one thing you touched on there, Marc. I don't think, in your prepared remarks you commented on instrument versus consumable revenue growth in the quarter or the exit rates. Would you be willing to share any details on those data? Stephen Williamson : Yes. That was very skewed by the tailwinds. When you think about tailwinds at large, they're going to be consumables right now. Excluding that, I clearly instrument purchases were at a lower level of growth than consumables and services. Customer activity has been relatively low. And we expect that to pick up in the second half of the year. Doug Schenkel : Okay. And one last one, really building off of some earlier questions, but trying to get a little more granular. Glaxo has talked about selling vaccines at about $10 per unit, which in their words is around cost. Pfizer this morning just agreed to sell to the U.S. at $19.50 [ph] per unit for their vaccine, which is, I think just a smidge above cost of [Technical Difficulty]. Is there a rule of thumb we can use on what percentage of unit pricing would typically be up for grab for Thermo, whether it's on a per unit vaccine basis or using services? I mean, just using that 10 to 19.50 range, how much of that would normally end up going to Thermo as a component of cost? Marc Casper : It's really extraordinarily different to do. Let me just visualize it for you, which is why I really can't give you an answer. If you think about the vaccine, I can give you two different views of how it gets administered in those cases. One is single unit, meaning one vial, one vaccine; another is a vial where you put a syringe and take out the vaccine and you have 10 or 20 units of the vaccine doses in the single thing. You're going to get wildly different CDMO revenue or our revenue based on just even the filling strategy of those companies. So, very hard to do a rule of thumb until you know exactly the dosage form and so forth. And, is it -- what's the technology used in the vaccine. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda from SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Puneet Souda : Yes. Hi. Thanks Marc. And congrats on the quarter and impressive quarter here for sure. And thanks for your commitment to both, research and improving the lives here with COVID testing and commitment to vaccines. So, first one, if I could ask on capital deployment, given the COVID benefits you're seeing on testing and the growth you expect to see from vaccines, what is your thinking, long-term thinking on capital deployment, given that the vaccines scenario is actually multiyear, as you pointed out? Are you thinking about capital deployment any differently than before? Marc Casper : So, Puneet, thanks for the question. So, from a capital deployment strategy, I don't think it really changes too much. What I would say is, over the longer period of time, it's going to be a blend return of capital and the majority being redeployed into M&A in the business. If you think about the past quarter or March forward, obviously a large acquisition in Qiagen, also a nice bolt-on acquisition, which we announced and will close next year in CSL\u2019s biologics facility. And I think, you'll see us do a cadence of smaller and larger deals over time with a steady return of capital. So, our business is performing at a high level. Our expectations for the future is that it's going to perform at a high level. And that's going to give us very substantial cash flow to be able to redeploy. Stephen Williamson : Yes. And we\u2019ve also increased that CapEx significantly to address capacity and capability enhancements for the COVID-19 response as well. Puneet Souda : Okay. That's very helpful. And my second question is on, you have a unique vantage point, Marc and a global perspective, given Thermo's position and the scale and the speed that you pointed out to. As you look at research funding across the globe, there's an expectation here that the research funding is likely to grow. Magnitude is unknown at this point. But, could you give us a sense of that, given what you're seeing, given the magnitude of this crisis? What does this mean for the next five years across the life science tools industry? And more importantly for Thermo, when it relates to academic funding and research funding across the globe? Marc Casper : So, Puneet, thanks for the question. So, as we talk to governments and we talk to our customers and we use our experience, life science tools and diagnostics and our pharma service capabilities, it's a fantastic industry with great market growth characteristics you see in the industry perform well in this environment. My expectation is when the dust settles, the commitment to life science research, healthcare infrastructure systems is going to be even better over time than what the strong period that we enjoyed. And we're seeing some of the early excitement of the importance of the work. And so, I'm very bullish about what the long-term benefit will be. Obviously, there's going to be ebbs and flows because of the economy and affordability and those things. But, if I think the long term perspective, I'm very optimistic for what our industry holds and for the strong competitive position that we\u2019ve built to serve in that industry. Puneet Souda : Great, thank you. Kenneth Apicerno : Operator, we have time for just one more. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steve Beuchaw : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for letting me run the anchor leg here. I have a two-parter for Marc as it relates to a couple of subcategories within testing. And then, I have one on the financials for Stephen. Marc, there are a couple of potential drivers of testing prospectively for you and for the space broadly. One is screening. We've heard, just for example, a number of universities talk about reasonably high frequency testing of asymptomatic people on campuses. I wonder if you could speak to what extent asymptomatic screening is or is not in your plan, and whether you think there could be a material tailwind? And then, the second part of my testing question actually relates to serology. Serology did kind of quite as well as we hoped initially. It just doesn't seem to be finding as many instances as we had hoped for in the antibody signal of immunity. Can you speak to how you think that market evolves? Are there ways we could get the yields higher? Marc Casper : Yes. So, Steve, thanks for the question. In terms of screening or asymptomatic patients, what we would say is that's a life type activity, back to work, back to school. We see the interest level dramatically increasing with many different use cases. And we expect to play a role in a number of that. And some of that is embedded in the demand that is in Q3. And my take is that the methodology on asymptomatic screening, not the platform, but things like pooling and so forth could facilitate some of that ramp up over time as a different strategy. So, I think that will create a tailwind over time to support the activity while testing its relevant. On serology, we're developing our assay. We're taking it through the regulatory process. As the medical community better understands the immune response or what it means, serological testing becomes more relevant. And so right now, there's capacity out there. We're bringing out a high quality tests. And as customers need it, we'll be able to supply. You do have one question for Stephen quickly. We should wrap. Steve Beuchaw : One question just real quick for Stephen. Can you put any commentary around cost savings that you've identified from things like, lower T&E or other expenses from being virtual that you think are sustainable? Thanks so much. Stephen Williamson : Yes. So clearly, we control costs very effectively and we're all learning to live in a different environment. And T&E expenses are going to be dramatically lower, I think for the long-term, since that\u2019s how we are thinking about managing the Company and taking advantage of the technologies that we've invested in over time. So, it\u2019s my guess is probably a couple of hundred million dollars over time that you get to that level of saving of ongoing costs. So, we're appropriately managing the Company both, short-term and I think the long-term opportunities. Marc Casper : So, we'll wrap here with -- first, thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to have delivered an exceptional quarter during a very challenging time. We're proud of our role in helping our customers and society. And we're going to continue to manage the Company appropriately to come out of this period an even stronger industry leader. We look forward to updating you on our progress, and I hope that you stay safe. And as always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks everyone. End of Q&A: Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thanks, Ken, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our 2020 third quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered exceptional performance again in Q3 as we continue to build on the significant progress we made last quarter. I continue to be humbled by the incredible efforts of our team as they answer the call to help our customers and society manage through this unprecedented time. Not only did they expand our leading role in supporting the Global COVID-19 response, but they also effectively managed through this environment to return our base business to growth. The work we're doing today is clearly having a profound impact on the world, and for that we can be very proud. But it's important to note that our efforts are also strengthening Thermo Fisher for the future, and making us a more valuable partner for our customers. I see many positive trends from this period that will increase our contributions to healthcare. A few examples that I referenced during our recent analyst meeting are worth repeating. We're seeing much greater collaboration among industry and governments globally. Funding for research diagnostics and development of therapies and vaccines will increase to prepare for future health threats. We'll see more focus on supply chain security and the building of national stockpiles as well, and all of this has put a significant spotlight on the need for a stronger commitment to improving healthcare systems globally. We're already seeing the impact of these trends on our business, and I'll give you a number of examples later in my remarks, but first, I'll review our financial performance and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets. From a financial perspective, in Q3, we continue to work with speed at scale to support our customers, generating approximately $2 billion of COVID-19-related revenue in the quarter. At the same time, our teams did excellent work to grow our base business. This led to exceptional performance across all of our key financial metrics. Our reported revenue increased 36% in Q3 year-over-year to $8.52 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 97%, to $2.80 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased to 32.9%, and we grew our adjusted EPS by 91%, to $5.63 per share in the quarter. We're continuing to manage the company appropriately in a very fluid environment, exercising the cost discipline that you'd expect from us, while investing significantly in new products, services, and capabilities that will create value over the longer-term. Turning to our end markets, our performance was a combination of our significant pandemic response and the return to growth in our base business. Starting with pharma and biotech, the largest of our four end markets, we delivered an excellent Q3, growing 20%. We've performed very well in this end market for many years, and we further accelerated our growth by helping these customers to ramp up development of COVID-19 therapies and vaccines. The combination of strong market fundamentals and pandemic-related activities led to strength across all of the businesses servicing this end market, particularly bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences, and our research and safety market channel. In academic and government we grew in the low single digits in Q3. We captured opportunities as more of these customers returned to work and their research activities increased. Turning to industrial and applied, while we declined in the low single digits during the quarter, we saw a meaningful sequential improvement from Q2. Last, in diagnostics and healthcare, we had an incredible quarter, delivering 130% growth. While we continue to see the impact of a lower level of routine doctor visits and related testing, demand did improve from Q2 levels and our COVID-related testing revenue grew significantly during the quarter. We saw the benefits of these dynamics across our Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics businesses. As you know, our involvement here includes providing both proprietary COVID-19 diagnostic test kits as well as reagents used for laboratory-developed tests, along with sample collection products and instrumentation. So, in summary, our teams put forth an amazing effort in Q3, not only increasing our response to the pandemic but also returning our base business the growth. The combination resulted in performance that positions us to deliver our best year yet. Turning to our business highlights for the quarter, as you know, we continue to increase our capabilities so we can the best partner for our customers and strengthen our competitive position. In Q3, we worked with speed at scale to address the critical needs brought on by the pandemic, while making great progress in executing our growth strategy across our businesses. Let me cover a few of the highlights. In terms of our pandemic response, we continue to expand our role as a trusted partner for industry and governments around the world. It's important to note that while this has clearly driven exceptional growth for us so far this year, much of what we're putting in place now will create sustainable value longer-term. First, as you know, we have the leading position in providing COVID-19 diagnostic test kits given our gold standard PCR-based tests and our industry-leading install base of instruments, and we continue to expand our presence by bringing new solutions to the market that help the medical community ramp up testing capacity, and enable society's return to work and school. In September, we launched a new highly automated solution called Amplitude that helps laboratories quickly scale up to meet testing volumes. This platform is based on our TaqPath combo kit and the QuantStudio 7 PCR instruments, and has the highest sample throughput in the industry. We're seeing strong demand for this innovative solution, and we've already completed installation at several customer sites. We also recently introduced two new Thermo Scientific antibody tests, our OmniPath ELISA test received emergency use authorization from FDA for the qualitative detection of total antibodies, and our new EliA test is now available to run on our Phadia 250 instrument so customers can tap into the extensive install base worldwide. Both tests can be used in the U.S. as well as Europe, and other countries accepting the CE mark. As I reflect on the long-term, we're now recognized by our customers as a scale player in infectious disease testing. We've significantly increased our install base of sample preparation and PCR instruments over the last nine months, and that will create new opportunities for us going forward. Another example of sustainable value is that we continue to ramp up production of supplies that are essential to the testing process, such as liquid handling plastics and the specialized viral transport media used in sample collection. We highlighted the opening of our new viral transport media facility, in Kansas, last quarter, and in Q3, we announced plans to further expand our global capacity by building a new facility in Scotland to support the European market. We're also significantly expanding capacity for our lab plastics to meet surging demand which will put us in a great position long-term as well, and important point that I want to make here is that our PPI business system is a key advantage in our ability to scale our operations quickly and cost-effectively to meet our customers' needs and drive growth. One more example of sustainable value creation is our support of new therapies and vaccines. We're significantly adding capacity across our biosciences, bioproduction, and former services businesses, creating an infrastructure that will position us incredibly well for the future. In our biosciences business, we're significantly investing in our global capacity to increase the manufacturing of enzymes and nucleotides used in vaccines. In pharma services, last week we announced our partnership with the Economic Development Board of Singapore to expand our sterile fill finish capacity by building our first facility there. Once operational in 2022, the facility will include the only high-speed filling line for live viruses in Singapore and help meet the demand across the Asia-Pacific region. This is another great example of how we're working with speed with governments to help them respond effectively to health emergencies in the future. In addition to government-funded projects, including our BARDA project to increase capacity in the U.S., that we highlighted last quarter, we've committed more than $700 million in CapEx to add global capacity to meet COVID-related demand. In summary, all of this work is clearly essential to helping our customers navigate the pandemic, and it's also giving us new capabilities and capacity that will be repurposed to meet future demand for vaccines and therapies. While our COVID-19 response contributed significantly to our performance, we are also continuing to make great progress in executing our growth strategy across the business. I'll give you just a few highlights from the quarter. In terms of innovation, we launched a number of significant new products in Q3. Let me pick a couple to highlight, one from our electron microscopy business and one from bioproduction. Our new Thermo Scientific Selectris X Imaging Filters are breakthrough advances in cryo-EM for structural biology applications. These new filters allow scientists to view protein structures in unprecedented detail and in less time than what was previously possible. This will not only accelerate research but also accelerate the adoption of cryo-EM, and another new product is our Thermo Scientific POROS Oligo resin which is used to purify and isolate mRNA for the development of vaccines and therapies. As mRNA production accelerates, the needs of highly scalable purification technology will be critical. In emerging markets our leading scale continues to be an advantage for us, and we are expanding our presence to meet customer demand. During the quarter we celebrated the grand opening of a new factory in Suzhou, China, for our single use bio-production technologies. As you know, we already have a well-established lab products operation in Suzhou, and this expansion is our first bio-production facility in the Asia-Pacific region, which will help meet increasing demand there for biologics. Our teams in China have effectively managed through the pandemic while positioning the business for growth, and we were pleased to deliver 18% growth in China in Q3. The last part I want to highlight around the progress we are making across our business is tied to our unique value proposition. Our customers recognize that we stepped up in a major way to help them navigate the challenging environment and that's creating new opportunities to build on our already strong relationships. This is very evident in forming biotech as you know, and now increasingly so with healthcare and diagnostic customers as well. During this time, the advantage of our leading scale and depth of capabilities has never been more evident, and this will lead to share gain opportunities longer term. Before I turn to our guidance, I'll make a quick a comment on capital deployment. As you know, our capital deployment strategy is a combination of returning capital through buybacks and dividends and strategic M&A. In terms of our view on M&A, we continue to have an active deal pipeline. We have a very strong balance sheet, and as always, we'll apply disciplined quiet approach the opportunities that meet our criteria for creating shareholder value. Turning to our guidance, there has obviously been a tremendous effort in supporting the COVID-19 response this year, and we've also executed well to grow our base business. This combination led to extraordinary growth and performance in Q3, and we expect that to continue to Q4. With that context, we expect to grow full-year 2020 revenue by 20% to approximately $30.5 billion, and we expect to grow our full-year 2020 adjusted EPS by 48% to $18.27 per share. Stephen will give you more of the details, but clearly, we are on track to achieve our truly spectacular year. Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me leave you with a couple of takeaways. We continue to expand our leading role in responding to the pandemic, and we are having a profound impact on society. We are executing very well to capture new opportunities, gain market share, and drive growth across our businesses. Our efforts this year are significantly strengthening our company and positioning us very well for the long term. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc, and good morning everyone. I'll begin with a high level summary of our Q3 performance. As Marc mentioned, we have another exceptional quarter and grew organically 34%. I'll break this down into two elements. The first is the scale of our COVID-19 response revenue that we generated during the quarter, and the second is the performance of the base business. Our COVID-19 response revenue in the third quarter was $2 billion and contributed 31% to growth; largely driven by testing related products and instruments. Our base business excluding the COVID-19 revenue grew organically 3%. We are very pleased to deliver a 13-point improvement from Q2 driven by a higher customer activity levels and great commercial execution. The 34% organic growth for the quarter was higher than the updated our recent analyst meeting, as we continue to have robust demand for testing, and the potential risks around the level of customer activity did not materialize. Our PPI business system enabled excellent pull through on the 34% organic growth, a combination of fixed cost leverage and operating with speed at scale enabled us to deliver 91% growth in adjusted earnings per share on the quarter, a truly exceptional result. I'll now provide more details on our third quarter results then provide some color on our four segments and conclude with some comments around guidance. Starting with our Q3 earnings results, as I mentioned we grew adjusted EPS by 91% to $5.63. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.84 up 157% from Q3 last year. On the top line, our Q3 reported revenue grew 36% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue increased included 34% organic growth, a foreign exchange tailwind of 1% and 1% growth from acquisitions. Turning to our growth by geography during the quarter, North America grew 40%, Europe grew 25%, Asia Pacific grew just under 20% as the China and rest of the world grew 65%. Looking at our operational performance, Q3 adjusted operating income increased to 97% and adjusted operating margin was 32.9%, 10 percentage points higher than Q3 last year. In the quarter, our PPI business system enabled it to drive exceptional volume leverage and strong productivity, and we had a favorable business mix. At the same time, we continue to make some significant strategic investments across the businesses. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 52.3%, up 620 basis points from Q3 of the prior year. The increase in gross margin had similar drivers to those I just mentioned for our adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16% of revenue, a decrease of 350 basis points versus Q3 2019 reflecting the very strong volume leverage. Total R&D expense was $296 million, 20% higher than Q3 2019 and R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q3 was 5.2%. Looking our results below the line for the quarter, net interest expense was $135 million, $24 million higher than Q3 last year, primarily due to increased debt levels. Adjusted other income and expense with net income in the quarter was approximately $2 million, $24 million lower than Q3 2019, mainly due to changes in non-operating foreign exchange. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 15.7%. This is up 450 basis points versus Q3 last year due to the substantial increase in pre-tax profit year-over-year coming in at our marginal tax rates. Average diluted shares were $399 million in Q3 about $5 million lower year-over-year driven by the net impact of share repurchases and option dilution. Turning to cash flow in the balance sheet, cash flow was another great highlight for the quarter. Our PPI business system is enabling us to deliver great cash pull through on the very strong top line performance. For the first nine months, cash flow from continuing operations was $5 billion and free cash flow was $4.1 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of approximately $900 million. We returned approximately $90 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter, and we ended Q3 with approximately $7.5 billion in cash and $21.1 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.5 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 1.6 times on a net basis. Concluding my comments and our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 14.9%, up 330 basis points from Q3 last year, as we continue to generate a very strong return. Now to provide some color on the performance of our four business segments, similar to last quarter, I'll start with some framing thoughts around the impact of COVID-19 response had on the segment results. From a revenue standpoint in Q3, the majority of the COVID-19 response revenue is reflected in Life Science Solutions. This is revenue from testing kits, instruments, sample preparation and reagents for lab developed tests recognized in the genetic sciences and biosciences businesses. It also includes revenue from therapy and vaccine production supplies recognized in the bioproduction business. The Specialty Diagnostics segments include revenue and the clinical diagnostics business from the molecular controls that go into testing kits. We also recognized revenue to viral transport media in the microbiology business and for tests and PP&E in the healthcare market channel. Laboratory Products and Services segment includes revenue for therapy and vaccine support biopharma services business. The segment also includes revenue for PPE in the recession safety market channel as well as plastics used in testing workflows and cold storage equipment manufactured by a lab products business. So, a lot of detail to take in, but I think it really demonstrates the breadth of our societal response to the pandemic. From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 was varied across the segments, based on the scale of the response revenue, and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. In addition, during the quarter, we continue to make strategic investments in our businesses, even though that we're not benefiting from COVID-19 response revenue. This included investments in our colleagues in terms of incentive compensation recognition, as well as commercial R&D and production capability investments. We are able to do this given the strength of the company's overall performance. The size of these investments does not necessarily align with COVID-19 response revenue in each segment. So that does skew some of the reported segment margins. So, a lot of moving parts from a segment margin standpoint, it reflects the very active management of the company, successfully navigating the current environment and positioning the company for an even brighter future. Moving on to segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions, in Q3, reported revenue increased 101%, and organic revenue growth was 100%. We saw exceptionally strong growth in our genetic sciences and biosciences businesses, as well as very strong growth in our bioproduction business. In Q3, adjusted operating income and lifestyle solutions increased 221%, and adjusted operating margin was 54.9%, up 20 percentage points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull through at public business mix and continue to make strategic investments across the businesses in the segment. The Analytical Instruments segment reported a revenue decrease of 2% in Q3, and an organic revenue decline of 3%, an increased level of customer activity and good commercial execution led to a 20 percentage point sequential improvement in the business performance from Q2, and chromatography and mass spectrometry business return to growth in the quarter. Q3 adjusted operating income and Analytical Instruments decreased 45% and adjusted operating margin was 12.8%, down 10 percentage points year-over-year. Eight percentage points of this change was due to $100 million one-time accounting charge that we took in Q3 for a loss on a supply contract in our electron microscopy business. This was triggered by the very successful launch of our new Thermo scientific Selectris imaging filter. The remainder of the margin reduction in the quarter was driven by business mix, lower volumes and strategic investments, partially offset by strong productivity. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segments, in Q3 reported revenue increased by 63%, organic revenue growth was 62%. COVID-19 response revenue was significant in the quarter, enabling us to deliver very strong growth in our microbiology healthcare market channel and clinical diagnostics businesses. The pandemic continues to impact routine diagnostic testing activity, and this is most pronounced in our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses in the quarter. However, it was encouraging to see a substantial pickup in activity from Q2. Adjusted operating income increased 79% and adjusted operating margin was 27.9%, up 260 basis points from the prior year. In the quarter we saw a very strong volume leverage partially offset by negative business mix and strategic investments. Finally in Laboratory Products and Services segments, Q3 reported revenue increased 19%. Organic revenue growth was 16%. In the quarter we saw a strong growth in our research and safety market channel, pharma services and laboratory products businesses. Adjusted operating income in the segment for Q3 increased 17%, and adjusted operating margin was 11.4%, 20 basis points lower than prior year. In the quarter, the segment drove strong productivity and volume leverage, but this was more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments that I mentioned earlier. So with that, now let me turn to guidance. I'll provide you a current view for both organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter and for the full-year 2020. I'll also provide an update on certain full-year 2020 assumptions to help you with your modeling. I'll start with organic growth. Our current estimate for Q4 organic growth is 29%. That's driven by an expected $1.75 billion of COVID-19 response revenue and organic growth in the base business of low-to-mid single digits. The impact of the pandemic continues to evolve, and as a result, through potential outcomes both above and below the 29% that could play out in Q4. From a capacity standpoint, should that be customer demand above the 29% level, we're well positioned to be able to support our customers as we did in Q3. In terms of adjusted earnings per share, we expect considerable volume leverage from the 29% organic growth in Q4. At that level of growth, we expect to deliver approximately 60% year-over-year growth and adjusted earnings per share in Q4. A few additional points of color on this outlook, similar to prior quarters, the volume of testing undertaken by our customers will be the most significant factor determining the extent of our COVID-19 response revenue in Q4. The outlook also includes a continued ramp in the support of therapies and vaccines. Regarding the base business growth, this assumes similar levels of activity to Q3, and the benefit of the two extra days being offset by slightly weaker year-end spend than in Q4 2019, given the current environment that seems like a reasonable assumption to start the quarter with a well-positioned to assist customers should funding availability be higher. The outlook does not anticipate to return to the lockdown seen at the height of the pandemic earlier in the year. Supporting all of this in a full-year context, our current estimate for 2020 revenue is $30.52 billion, which would represent 20% growth over 2019 including 19% organic growth. In terms of adjusted earnings per share, our current estimate for the full-year 2020 is $18.27, which represents 48% growth over 2019. We're on track for a truly spectacular year. I will now move on to an update of some of the additional modeling elements for the full-year. With regards to FX in 2020, we're now assuming that we'll have a negligible impact on revenue based on current FX rates. We expect net interest cost for the year to be approximately $490 million. We're assuming that adjusted other net income will be about $50 million for the year and we expect the full-year adjusted income tax rate to be 14.2%. Net capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. This includes $400 million of CapEx to support our COVID-19 response in 2020. We continue to execute while on growth related CapEx opportunities particularly in our pharma services and bioproduction businesses. These have short and long-term benefits and provide very strong returns on investment. In terms of capital deployments, we completed the $1.5 billion a share buybacks in Q1 and assuming no further buybacks in the remainder of 2020. We're also continuing to assume that we're returning approximately $350 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, and we estimate that the full-year average diluted share count will be between 398 million and 400 million shares. So, to wrap up, as you can see from our exceptional performance in Q3, we continue to manage the company extremely effectively strengthen our leadership in responding to the global pandemic, and position ourselves to deliver a spectacular year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth Apicerno : Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from J.P. Morgan. Tycho Peterson : Hi, good morning. Congrats on the quarter, certainly impressive. Marc, I want to start with the LPS strength, 16% organic. I'm just wondering if you could provide a little bit of color on how much of this is vaccine ramp versus recovery and non-COVID-related trial work, was there any kind of catch-up benefit here in the quarter from stuff in 2Q, and how do you think about sustaining this level and ramping on the LPS side and into 4Q and 2021? Marc Casper : Thanks, Tycho. Good morning. So, in terms of our Lab Products & Services businesses, all three of the businesses performed in the quarter. So that's pharma services, our CDMO activities, that's our customer channels group, and that's our lab products business, and we saw activity ramp up, as we did for the whole company, on the sort of normal business activity in the quarter, and at the same point, you're seeing two different types or three different types of COVID-related response embedded in those numbers. Clearly, the vaccine and therapy ramp up is happening, and you see that certainly in our pharma services business. You're also seeing very significant demand in our customer channels business for things like PPE as well as all the supplies you would use for COVID response. And then in our lab products business, we have very strong demand for our lab plastics as well as our cold storage equipment. As you know, we're a market leader in providing cold storage for laboratory use, and effectively, when you read about some of the vaccines needed cold storage across the supply chain we're getting very, very significant demand for those products. The basis is very good, right, so that's gone well, and then obviously on top of that you're seeing the benefits of those types of activity. Tycho Peterson : Great, and then a follow-up just on the plastic side, curious on your views on the durability of that non-automated PCR business which had driven a lot of strength in the first-half of the year, and then with Amplitude, I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about positioning there. Obviously it's got the highest throughput, as you noted. Is the traction you're seeing now from academic labs, are you seeing interest from reference labs or hospitals, can you just talk about how you think about both the durability of non-amplified testing, and then Amplitude as well. Thanks. Marc Casper : Yes, so, Tycho, in terms of the demand for our PCR testing, it continues to be very strong, right, and if you think about it, gold standard performance in terms of accuracy, largest install base of instruments around the world, and we have supplied our customers and ramped up, and we have been the supplier that there's been no headaches really from a customer perspective through the pandemic. We have built our capacity ahead of demand consistently, and therefore customers have been happy, and know they can rely on us. Amplitude is an ultra-high throughput system, over 6,000 tests per day, and we're seeing very large demand. We've seen that demand from governments, we've seen that demand from reference labs and hospital systems, right. So it is a niche application but drives enormous volumes, right, because ultra-high throughput, so those labs, those governments that are really providing the support for high volume, given our supply reliability, the quality of our tests, and the dedication that we've had throughout the pandemic, that product will be a good growth driver. In terms of durability, we believe that PCR testing is going to continue to be very relevant to our customers because it gives you the most accurate information, and therefore we're comfortable with continuing with a strong level of demand in the fourth quarter, and we expect that those products are going to be relevant in 2021 because, unfortunately, the pandemic is still with us. Thanks, Tycho. Tycho Peterson : Okay, thank you. Operator : Vijay Kumar from Evercore, your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Thank you, guys, and congrats, Marc, you guys are setting a new bar trying to beat that pre-announced revenue, that's really impressive. Maybe on just the Q4 guidance there, I guess we were looking $2 billion of, I guess -- $1.6 billion of COVID tailwinds for 3Q that's coming in north of $2 billion here for 3Q, so one -- and if you look at the guidance for Q4 of $1.75 billion, I'm just curious if -- if was there any tiny element, did some of the tailwinds get pulled forward to 3Q, and when you look at the base guidance of low to mid single digits maybe it looks like a lot of it is being driven by biopharma. Maybe comment on industrial and academic environment heading into Q4. Marc Casper : Yes, so, Vijay, thanks for the question, and it's exciting to be able to set a new bar on performance, right. So that's been an interesting time for sure. In terms of our guidance, the way that we think about the fourth quarter is base business similar to what we saw in Q3 to a little bit better, and what's assumed in there, and it's an assumption, it's not based on customer feedback, is that year-end spend is softer than it was last year, and we're well positioned to meet it if higher demand, if customers have the funding, and our logic to that was it's a little bit early to know. It's a conservative assumption, and we don't want to disappoint. So if the funding is strong you know that, like we did in these last few quarters or many years actually, if the money is out there we're going to go out and get it, right. So that's the view on the base business, of low to mid single digit growth. When you look at the $1.75 billion, we see very strong demand right now for our COVID response. We're seeing a continued build in our vaccine and therapy role, and we are also seeing very strong demand for our testing solutions as well. You have less visibility into the month of December. So we have much better visibility, obviously, in October and November, and we just made an assumption that levels were going to be pretty similar to what we saw in the third quarter, and we came in at $1.75 billion. I wouldn't over-read into why $1.75 billion versus $2 billion, it's just that we have visibility for a couple of months, and December we have less visibility, but nonetheless it seems like demand should be strong. Vijay Kumar : That's extremely helpful, Marc, and just one follow-up on, I guess, at the analyst day you made a comment about contractors orders on the vaccine worked about a billion, any update on that number? Marc Casper : Yes, so in terms of our role for vaccines and therapeutics, we said over the balance of this year, '21, and '22 it's about $1 billion, and than number continues to grow, so I'd call it a $1 billion-plus at this point. We're active in a significant number of projects, something in the range of over 250 projects on therapies and vaccines, and our role is quite broad, it's not just pharma services, it's bioproduction, biosciences, and -- so that will be a -- is contributing to our revenue, but will contribute more certainly as the fourth quarter, and into the next year progresses. Vijay Kumar : Thank you, guys. Marc Casper : Thanks, Vijay. Operator : Steve Beuchaw from Wolfe Research, your line is open. Steve Beuchaw : Hi, good morning, and thanks for the time here. I wanted to ask one on academic, just looking to unpack a little bit of the commentary in the prepared remarks, and then one just very quick follow-up on Amplitude and the broader testing landscape. My question on academic is a two-parter. I guess one is, we all watch all the headlines about what's going on in the university backdrop. I wonder if you could give your perspective on research labs within universities and broader research sort of opening up here as we progress through the back-half of the year, to what extent is that reopening necessarily contingent upon a broader university reopening, and then to your point on funding, Marc, certainly makes a lot of sense, but to what extent is that a medium-term versus a near-term perspective on funding just given all the unknowns right now, not necessarily in the U.S., but in China and Europe as it relates to how they're going about funding in research. Marc Casper : Yes, so, Steve, thanks for the questions. So, in terms of the academic and government, good to see the return to growth, clearly more customers came back to work, ramping up research activities, and that actually was a global phenomenon; we saw that across all three of the regions, and they all happened at different paces, but it's good to see that. When I made the comments at the very beginning of my remarks, really the funding environment I'm thinking about is the midterm, right, it's [technical difficulty] -- what I mean by that is there's such interest now in infectious disease, the pandemic, the importance, like in the U.S., of how NIH has played a huge role here. Those things are going to really, for the midterm, be very positive on a funding environment. Even short-term we're seeing quite a bit of interest from governments, and then obviously academic institutions, their own situation is probably much more impacted by their own economics, so that's going to be somewhat of a headwind, but that historically has been a low to mid single-digit growth market, and it's good to see we're already back to low single-digit growth there. Steve Beuchaw : Super clear. The follow-up, building on some of the commentary around Amplitude, looks like an approach that makes a lot of sense, not just for higher acuity or symptomatic, but for screening, which should be interesting to hear how you think the market for testing PCR and more broadly evolves towards screening over the next year and beyond, given that you have a unique perspective on all sides of the market? Thanks again. Marc Casper : Well, Steve, in terms of the role of testing, obviously managing in a pandemic is around social distancing, mask-wearing, good hygiene, and all of those things, and testing is a valuable supplemental tool to that, and we're seeing more and more demand for testing in those applications as well for kind of return-to-life is what we call it, which is really work in school, and things like the Amplitude is going to be able to support both medical applications as well as screening. You get a very high throughput, it's very economic, and therefore customers can get results quite rapidly, and therefore it plays a role, and what you're getting with PCR is extreme levels of accuracy versus some of the other technologies out there, which also will play a role, but you are trading accuracy, and depending on what the application is that's something that there certain applications doesn't make a lot of sense for. Operator, we'll take the next one. Operator : Derik de Bruin from Bank of America, your line is open. Derik de Bruin : Hi, great. Thank you, and good morning. So a little bit of -- can you give us a little bit more color on the split in the quarter on testing PPE in bioproduction, just how that $2 billion broke down that, and then I've got a follow-up. Marc Casper : Yes, Derik, good morning. So in terms of the $2 billion, the majority is the testing related portion of that, and when you think about the testing portion it's actually quite expansive, right. So the single largest piece of that is going to be on our proprietary COVID-19 TaqPath kits, PCR kits, but we also have significant revenue from instrumentation and lab-developed tests. So that's kind of the PCR ecosystem with all of the very substantial sample prep that we provide across the industry as well. We really have built tremendous momentum there. On top of that, our viral transport media business has grown very rapidly, so Q3 was a nice step up from Q2, and we expect that to continue to grow, and that is a key part of the specimen collection, sample collection and transport to a lab, and so that we'll continue to build, and we announced that we're opening up a new facility in Scotland. We broke ground on that, be able to start producing viral transport media at the end of the year to start the European market, beyond the two facilities in Europe that already do that. So that continues to be important. From the next aspect, which is probably the smallest aspect at this point, which is PPE, as you would expect there was clearly -- that's all through our channel business. There was very elevated prices in the beginning of the pandemic as there was massive supply constraints. Volume has still be high, pricing has come down, and so, therefore while there's a moderate level of activity a lot of volume at a lower price, and that's good from a societal standpoint. It's good to see suppliers catching up with demand, and then from the -- probably the fastest-growing and building is our broad role in kind of, I'll say, vaccines and therapies, and I'm going to define it broadly because I think that sometimes because we have the most comprehensive position in the industry that we don't get clearly compared to the right activity. So the way to think about it, and Stephen was articulating it, there's what we provide to the manufacturers of a vaccine or a therapy, and historically you'd look at that as bioproduction, and that would be our leading positions in cell culture media, single-use technology, and our rapidly growing position in purification resins. At the same point, our biosciences business actually has a very meaningful role in that as well through the enzyme and nucleotide production, and we're doing very substantial expansions of capacity to support those needs as well. So, that's one set of activity. The second set of the activity is obviously around our pharma services business, and you would see that in our sterile fill-finish network, where you do the filling of a vaccine or a biologic, but you also see that in our drug substance or biologics plants, and even with some of the antivirals that are small molecules, you can see them in our API facility. So, we're incredibly well-positioned in a very skill way to serve the vaccine and therapy opportunities, and you're already starting to see that build, and that will continue to build in Q4 and into next year. Derik de Bruin : Right, and just one quick follow-up, so you talked about your analytical instrumentation business, essentially back, you know, essentially roughly flat, are you dealing with back orders from the first-half of the year, or are you seeing new orders for LCMS, and then a appendix on that one is, what's your PCR base instrument install base up year-over-year, if you can get a sense? Marc Casper : So, in terms of the revenue, the really strong sequential improvement in revenue for Q3 versus Q2, the answer there is our orders are growing much faster than the revenue. So, we're actually building backlog. So, I don't think it is much of shifting from Q2 to Q3, just customer activity is really been picking up. You see that most quickly in our life science mass spec business and chromatography business. That business returned to growth in the quarter from a revenue perspective, and bookings were stronger than that. So, that's very encouraging, and then, as you would expect on the flip side, those areas that are very economically sensitive like chemical analysis, that's lagging, right, improved substantially, but lagging relative to the life sciences mass spec, and we have from a install base of sample prep and qPCR, we're shipping in a quarter what we would normally ship in a year. So, it doesn't give you the exact number, but it gives you the sense of the magnitude of how big that's been. Derik de Bruin : Thank you. Marc Casper : You are welcome. Operator : Doug Schenkel from Cowen, your line is open. Doug Schenkel : Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking our questions. Marc, during the Analyst Day last month, you commented I think in response to a question that COVID-19 tailwinds could be lower, about the same or higher on a year-over-year basis in 2021, do you have any updated thoughts on this, at this point, particularly in light of higher than expected COVID-19 contributions in Q3 and incorporating what you're seeing especially on the bioproduction side, given demand there has materialized a bit more recently, relative to diagnostics, and then, kind of building off of that longer-term meeting really beyond 2021. Do you think the investments you're making to support COVID-19 demand in each today and in 2021 will lead to at least stable levels of revenue in these product categories, even when the pandemic abates? Marc Casper : Yes. So, Doug, what I can say is that on the first one, I have to be 100%, right on the answer, right, if it's either up down or flat, then I\u2026 Doug Schenkel : Yes, yes. Marc Casper : [Multiple speakers] -- 100% accuracy on. So, those are two great questions, right? So, if I think about things that are building, clearly the broadly, you know, position and bioproduction, our pharma services business or biosciences nucleotide, that's all building, right? So, and then that's better than three or four weeks ago. It doesn't -- as you know, these things are very long cycle, they're moving at a much faster pace, but it takes a while for these products to get through the clinical process with approvals, and looking for efficacy. So, we see that building, and that's good for us in terms of what the outlook is. In terms of -- you know, unfortunately every day and week that we're still living with the pandemic means that things like testing are likely to be more durable, right? So that, you know, even six weeks or so after the analyst meeting, we're really in the same boat with actually more cases in Europe and a lot of increases in the pandemic. That usually adds to the view that there's going to be more durability to this going into '21, but we'll know more as we get into the year. So, in terms of the longer-term investments, a great question, right, the way to think about it is, we're investing significantly, you know $700 million is almost what we normally put in capital in the year roughly, right, so it's additional. We are it doing quickly, right. If you think about the pace that we are actually bringing facilities online gives you sense of the power of the PPI Business System. Pretty much everything that you are seeing we are going to repurpose longer term to other markets that are not pandemic-related, right, and some of them are very easy to visualize, right, which is think about start for finish, we have commitments for the expansions that we have done for vaccines and therapies, and we are also already getting commitments from customers -- large customers that basically say when that demand is freed up, we want to put other products in that demand, right.  it's : Doug Schenkel : Okay, and I'll leave it there, and let others ask other questions. Thank you very much. Marc Casper : Thanks Doug. Operator : Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research, your line is open. Steve Willoughby : Hi, good morning. Two questions for you, Marc, one just following up on some previous commentary if you don't mind, you talked about how you are assuming a weaker end of your spending environment within the guidance that you provided today, but I am curious as to your comments talking about how you are seeing customer activity really picking up, orders growing faster than revenue. Just wondering if you could provide any color on how those two -- the different comments sort of jive with each other, and then I have on follow-up for you. Marc Casper : Stephen, you want to talk a little bit about that? Stephen Williamson : No, so the comment about picking up versus Q2 so that sequential improvement in performance, and the assumption is similar levels of aggregate customer level activity in Q4, and yes, we have made an assumption around yearend spend, but as Marc said, if it's going to be higher, then our business is well-positioned to help our customers satisfy that demand. Marc Casper : And Steve, another way we have a say lots of discussions with our customers. It's a little tacky right now to say, so what is your yearend budget going to look like. It's just not a topic that is where you are focused on which is -- so not helping you, right, and this is not a normal year. So, I think that's a good place to start again for the quarter. Steve Willoughby : Very good, okay, and then I was just wondering if you could comment at all regarding the bioprocessing business overall, and what you saw in terms of level of growth there and maybe also maybe a level of orders for the bioprocessing business overall? Thank you. Marc Casper : Growth is very strong, stronger than the historically strong performance, and orders were significantly stronger than that strong growth, so very, very high level of order growth which you would expect, right. We play a major role in the therapies and vaccines broadly in all classes of disease, and we are playing a significant role in COVID. So, we are seeing very strong demand for our capabilities. Thanks Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Stifel. Your line is open. Dan Arias : Good morning, guys. Thank you. Marc, maybe just a follow-up on some color on bioproduction, can you comment on the visibility in terms of products and services when it comes to non-COVID work? I mean obviously it's all strong at a high level, but I guess I am just trying to understand the extent to which there is maybe from incremental uncertainty when you look at companies that are balancing COVID and non-COVID project loads. I mean are there error bars around the timing in some of this non-COVID campaign work that might be wider than normal as they move real fast here? Or, does it sort of all looks steady from where you sit at this point? Marc Casper : It seems pretty steady. I mean if think about manufacturing across the industry not our customers, has been smooth sailing through this period of time, right. Companies have been able to produce their medicines and develop their products for -- through the development process. So, we haven't seen COVID-related disruptions on the manufacturing side of biotech and pharmaceutical. It continues to grow very substantially. So, obviously there is going to be some diversion of short-term resources. So, maybe two or three years from now there is some project that has been theoretically less than what it could have been because of COVID work, but I think that's very much in the noise level, because if I look at things like new quotations and new activities, it's extraordinary high and our development work, clinical trials work. So, I think it's very good. Dan Arias : Okay, appreciate that. Maybe Stephen, can I just touch on Patheon for second there, and the margin mix within LPS? I think this Patheon was 17% or so at the up margin line when you bought the company. Obviously, the volume environment there looks pretty good. So, if we were to look forward, do you that business over the next couple of years can increasingly sort of provide some loss to LPS segment profitability if demand just shapes up here the way that it's look like it could? Stephen Williamson : Yes. So, I think we've made great progress with the margins in that business, and future as we drive more utilization of capacity will be very strong for the margin profile. Thanks, Dan. Marc Casper : Thanks Dan. Operator, we are going to take just one more. Operator : Jack Meehan from Nephron Research, your line is open. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Marc Casper : Hi, Jack. Jack Meehan : Marc, I was hoping you could comment a little bit more on the R&D investment. It's my favorite data point in the press release. So, just where are you maybe over-indexing some of the incremental spend? Are you pulling forward projects or diving deeper down the list, and is there a way to think about the payback on some this incremental spend? How long that should take? Marc Casper : Yes. So, Jack, thanks for the question. R&D spend was up about 20% in the quarter. So, we're investing substantially. It's really about adding more talent is the step that we are doing, and then working on some key areas that -- where demand actually has been a little bit softer. So, what we are doing is kind of doubling down the investment to position ourselves for strong growth for the long term. Very much the exact playbook we did in the financial crisis where we had a very high focus on investing in R&D so that we would bounce back out of the downturn quickly, and we did, and so we are doing that same playbook in certain areas and returns will show up in the next couple of years is the way to think about it. Thank you, Jack, for the question, and let me wrap up with a couple of things, first that we are certainly proud of our role in helping our customers and society during this time. We are going to continue to manage the company appropriately to come out of this period and even stronger industry leader. We look forward to updating you on our progress at yearend. I hope that you stay safe, and as always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our 2020 fourth quarter call and a wrap up of what's been a truly exceptional year for Thermo Fisher Scientific. I hope that you and your families are staying healthy as we all work to get beyond the pandemic. Before I cover many of the highlights from the quarter and the year, I want to share some news about our Investor Relations team. This will be Ken's last earnings call as he plans to retire at the end of March. You've all come to know Ken very well over the years. He's been leading the IR function since 2005 and is concluding a remarkable 25-year career at Thermo Fisher. Ken has been the voice of our company to the Street, and he excels in that role. He conveys his extensive knowledge of our company, our markets and our opportunities in a way that's informative and engaging. In fact, you voted ken the best IR professional in our industry multiple times over the year. And I couldn't agree more. He's been a terrific partner to me and Stephen. Ken, thank you for a truly stellar contribution to Thermo Fisher. Looking ahead, we're very fortunate to have Raf Tejada here to take the reins in March. Raf has been a part of the Thermo Fisher Investor Relations team for five years, and many of you knew him during his time at Wall Street, most recently at Bank of America as an analyst supporting Derik de Bruin. I know Raf and the team will carry forward Ken's legacy of excellence and Investor Relations. Please join me congratulating Raf on his new role, and wishing Ken all the best in his well deserved retirement. So moving on to our results for 2020, an unprecedented year by any measure. I'm pleased to report that we delivered the strongest year in our company's history that speaks to the incredible work of our 80,000 colleagues around the world. Through their tireless efforts, we led the industry in supporting our customers globally, enabling the societal response to the pandemic. We delivered outstanding results by working with speed at scale to meet our customers\u2019 evolving needs. This included generating $6.6 billion of COVID-19 response revenue, and quickly returning the base business to growth after the disruption seen across the globe earlier in 2020. The strength of our response activities allowed us to significantly accelerate investments in our company to create an even brighter future with a focus on talent, R&D and new capabilities and capacity. We also generated significant free cash flow during 2020. And we're good stewards of capital, creating shareholder value through share buybacks and dividends, building a strong M&A pipeline and reducing our net debt. I'll share some of the many highlights from the quarter and the year later in my remarks. But first, I'll cover the financials at a high level. Starting with the quarter, our revenue grew 54% in Q4 year-over-year to $10.55 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 107% to $3.51 billion and our adjusted operating margin expanded 840 basis points in Q4 to 33.3%. Finally adjusted EPS increased 100% to $7.09 per share in the quarter. Turning to our results for the full year, we grew revenue by 26% to $32.22 billion in 2020. Adjusted operating income increased 60% to $9.56 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 630 basis points to 29.7%. And we delivered a 58% increase in adjusted EPS to $19.55 per share. Both our fourth quarter and full year financial performance were truly exceptional on all metrics and demonstrate the strength of our growth strategy and our ability to move with speed at scale in responding to rapidly evolving customer needs.  Let me now turn to our end markets and give you some color on our performance for the quarter and the year. Starting with pharma and biotech. We had outstanding performance again in this end market delivering approximately 25% growth during Q4. We saw very robust growth across all businesses serving these customers, particularly bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences, and our research and safety market channel.  Our Q4 results capped off an excellent year of growth in the mid-teens. Our strong performance has been driven by our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our significant role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies.  In academic and government we grew in the high single-digits in the quarter as customers across the globe ramped up activity. We saw good growth across a range of our businesses, particularly chromatography and mass spectrometry, and our research and safety market channel. Similarly, in industrial and applied, the team\u2019s strong execution helped us return this end market to growth in Q4. We grew in the low single-digits during the quarter and it was good to see our electron microscopy business return to growth.  Given the significant impact of the pandemic on customer activity earlier in 2020, both the academic and government, and the industrial and applied end markets declined in the mid single-digit growth for the full year.  Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, we had another incredible quarter delivering more than 200% growth. Our COVID-19 testing revenue continued to accelerate in the quarter as customer demand for our sample preparation, PCR solutions and viral transport media remained very robust. For the full year, diagnostics and healthcare grew by more than 100%, driven by our leading role in supporting COVID-19 testing around the world. Our outstanding performance was the result of having the right technologies and the ability to rapidly scale up manufacturing which was enabled by our PPI Business System.  As I think back to this call a year ago, and how quickly conditions evolved during the year, I'm humbled by the incredible impact our team had in navigating the environment while supporting so many aspects of the pandemic response. As a reminder, early in the year, our cryo electron microscopes were used by researchers to create the first 3D image of the virus. We were a critical supplier of PPE leveraging our strong channel relationships to secure these products when supplies were scarce. We enabled COVID-19 testing at an unprecedented level, creating a market leading molecular diagnostics business in just a few months to support hundreds of millions of PCR tests around the world. And as you know, we've built trusted relationships with the pharma and biotech industry over many years, and have provided them with the right set of products and services.  As a result, these customers engage with us on a significant number of projects to help, develop and produce vaccines and therapies. In 2020 this led to $500 million in COVID-19 vaccine therapy revenue and we expect that to increase to $1 billion in 2021. Our comprehensive response to the pandemic demonstrates the unique capabilities of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Now let me turn to a business update framed by our growth strategy and highlight just a few of our many achievements. As a reminder, there are three pillars to our growth strategy. First, we're committed to high impact innovation. Second, we leverage our scale in high-growth and emerging markets. And third, we deliver a unique value proposition to our customers. Starting with the first pillar, it was an extraordinary year of high impact innovation. In response to the pandemic, we established worldwide leadership in COVID-19 testing. We quickly developed and gained regulatory approval to launch the TaqPath COVID-19 combo kit in March, providing gold standard PCR-based test for our customers at a scale our industry has never seen before. We also significantly expanded our portfolio of COVID-19-related products, including our Amplitude solution for high-throughput PCR-based testing and our TaqCheck PCR test for asymptomatic health surveillance. In addition, we launched a number of highly innovative products across our base business to strengthen our leading positions in analytical instruments, biosciences and bioproduction. For example, in mass spectrometry, we extended our industry-leading Orbitrap franchise with 2 new generation Exploris mass spectrometers. In our electron microscopy business, we launched 2 Selectris imaging filters for our cryo-electron microscopes. And in Q4, we introduced the Tundra cryo-electron microscope. And these are just some of the examples of how we're continuing to expand the benefits of this groundbreaking technology and democratize its use. The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in the high-growth and emerging markets. Our actions in the region are a great example of how our ongoing investments and the differentiated customer experience we've created sets us up to further capitalize on the significant growth opportunities there. In China, we further accelerated from our strong Q3 results, growing 30% in Q4. To continue to strengthen our presence in China and support the local biotech industry, during the year, we localized the manufacturing of single-use bioproduction technologies at our Center of Excellence in Suzhou. And in the quarter, we announced the formation of a joint venture to establish a biological drug development and manufacturing facility in Hangzhou. Last, I want to touch on the third pillar of our strategy, our unique customer value proposition. Entering 2021, our relationships with customers and governments around the world have never been stronger. Let me give you some examples. When the pandemic hit, we were uniquely positioned to help our pharma and biotech customers develop and eventually produce COVID-19 vaccine -- related therapies and vaccines because of the trusted relationships we've built over many years. We moved quickly and invested significantly in our infrastructure, scaling up to support the volumes needed as well as adding capabilities for new modalities such as mRNA. The broad and fast response helped deepen our already strong customer relationships, and this positions us incredibly well to help them with their near-term COVID-19 needs as well as the longer-term needs for future vaccines and therapies for other diseases. And through our extensive work in molecular diagnostics, clinical labs now have an even greater appreciation of our leading offering in specialty diagnostics. We've dramatically increased our PCR and sample preparation instrument installed base, and our customers have seen how strong a partner we are in addressing this -- their needs. Bringing this all together, we execute our proven growth strategy using our PPI business system that enables our teams to operate with speed at scale and was a key differentiator in our success last year. PPI is our operational discipline and enables us to translate the top-line growth into strong growth in earnings and free cash flow. We entered 2020 with excellent long-term growth prospects as a company. The way we executed for our customers throughout the year further unlocked our growth potential, which will benefit us in 2021 and beyond. Let me give you some color on the increased investments we were able to make because of our strong performance. In innovation, we ramped up our R&D investment by approximately 20% to $1.2 billion. In emerging markets, we expanded our localized capacity and capabilities to further advance our leadership. And to enhance our unique customer value proposition, we invested significant CapEx in our high-growth bioproduction, pharma services and biosciences businesses as well as in commercial capabilities to further differentiate the customer experience. In total, last year, we invested an additional $1 billion to accelerate our long-term growth, roughly half in CapEx and half in P&L investments. These actions, combined with the substantial investments planned for 2021, will position our company for a very bright future. Turning now to capital deployment. We have a strong track record of creating value for our shareholders, and we continued to execute our strategy in 2020. During the year, we returned a total of $1.8 billion in capital to our shareholders through share buybacks and a growing dividend. As you know, we announced several strategic bolt-on acquisitions. In our Pharma Services business, we entered into a strategic partnership with CSL to expand our biologics capacity for this rapidly growing market. We acquired Phitonex to enhance our flow cytometry offering for cell analysis. Shortly after year-end, we acquired the European viral vector manufacturing business from Novasep. And we signed an agreement to acquire Mesa Biotech to enhance our PCR-based diagnostics, adding gold standard technology in a rapid point-of-care testing format. We ended '21 -- 2021 with a very strong balance sheet, active and an active deal pipeline. As always, we'll continue to apply our disciplined approach to opportunities and continue to be good stewards of our capital. Before I turn to guidance, 2020 was also a significant year of progress in terms of environmental, social and governance priorities. We've always been a company that's focused on having a positive impact on the world. That's the true embodiment of our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. I'll highlight a couple of the initiatives that are having a big social impact. One is that we launched and significantly funded the Thermo Fisher Foundation for science, expanding our STEM education programs to benefit underserved communities. Another is that we established the Just Project, a collaboration with historically black colleges and universities where we've invested in a COVID-19 testing program, allowing students and faculty to safely return to campus. I'm proud of these and the many steps our teams are taking to make a difference in our communities around the world. Taking a step back and reflecting on the year as a whole, by all measures, we delivered an outstanding year. Now looking ahead to 2021. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly cover the highlights. In terms of our revenue guidance, we expect to deliver $35.1 billion in 2021, which would result in reported revenue growth of 9%. We're initiating adjusted EPS guidance of $21.62 per share for the full year. That's 11% growth year-over-year and a continuation of our outstanding track record. Before I hand the call over to Stephen, I'll leave you with my key takeaways for the year. The success of our growth strategy clearly sets us apart as the unrivaled leader in our industry. 2020 truly demonstrated the power of who and what we are as a company. During a unique time of need, we stepped up for our customers, enabling their important contributions to society and helping them navigate the recessionary impact of the pandemic. As a result, we were able to gain significant market share and solidify Thermo Fisher as their partner of choice. At the same time, we stay focused on driving strong returns from existing investments and made additional investments to accelerate our future growth. While I'm very proud of our accomplishments during the past year, as I look ahead, I couldn't be more excited about our opportunities in 2021 and beyond. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a high-level summary of our Q4 performance and full year results for the total company. Then I'll provide some color on our 4 segments and conclude with comments around our initial 2021 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we achieved an exceptional quarter and grew organically 51% in Q4. This resulted in full year organic growth of 25%. Similar to previous quarters, I'll break down the organic growth into 2 elements. The first is the performance of the base business and the second is the scale of the COVID-19 response revenue. In Q4, the base business grew 5% organically, another quarter of sequential improvement. For the full year, the base business was essentially flat as a result of slower economic activity earlier in the year due to the pandemic, partially offset by great commercial execution. Our COVID-19 response revenue also increased significantly in the fourth quarter to $3.2 billion, bringing the full year impact for our customers to $6.6 billion. This was largely driven by testing-related products and instruments. It is also worth noting that we generated $500 million of revenue in 2020 from support for COVID-19-related vaccines and therapies. Once again, our PPI Business System enabled excellent pull-through, and we delivered 100% growth in adjusted earnings per share in Q4 and 58% for the full year. Our PPI Business System also enabled us to generate extremely strong cash flow. Free cash flow for the year was $6.8 billion, up 67% versus the prior year. Overall exceptional financial results in 2020. Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance, starting with our Q4 earnings results. As I mentioned, we grew EPS -- adjusted EPS by 100% to $7.09. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $19.55, up 58% compared to last year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $6.24, up 151% from Q4 last year. And 2020 full year GAAP EPS was $15.96, up 74% versus prior year. On the top line, our Q4 reported revenue grew 54% year-over-year. The components of our Q4 reported revenue increase included 51% organic growth and a 3% benefit from foreign exchange. For the full year 2020, reported revenue increased 26%. This includes a 25% contribution from organic growth and a 1% tailwind in foreign exchange. Turning to our growth by geographies. During the quarter, all regions delivered very strong growth. North America grew just over 65%; Europe grew approximately 50%; Asia Pacific grew approximately 20%, including China, which grew 30%; and rest of the world grew approximately 50%. For the full year, North America grew just over 30%, Europe grew over 25%, Asia Pacific grew 5% and rest of the world grew approximately 45%. Turning to our operational performance. Q4 adjusted operating income increased 107%; and adjusted operating margin was 33.3%, 840 basis points higher than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 60% and adjusted operating margin was 29.7%, which is 630 basis points higher than 2019. In the quarter and for the full year, our PPI Business System enabled us to drive exceptional volume leverage, and we also had favorable business mix. This was partially offset by strategic investments across all of our businesses to support our near and long-term growth. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 53.9%, up 760 basis points from Q4 of the prior year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 51.2%, up 480 basis points versus prior year. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, the increase in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 17% of revenue, a decrease of 60 basis points versus Q4 2019 due to the strong volume leverage. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 17.9% of revenue, an improvement of 120 basis points compared to 2019. Total R&D expense was $376 million for Q4 and $1.2 billion for the full year, representing growth of 44% and 18%, respectively, reflecting our increased investments in high-impact innovation. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $134 million, $37 million higher than Q4 last year, primarily due to higher level of debt. Net interest expense for the full year was $488 million, an increase of $37 million from 2019. Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense in the quarter of approximately $3 million, $19 million lower than Q4 2019, mainly due to changes in non-operating FX.  For the full year, adjusted other income and expense was a net income of $40 million, which was $32 million lower than the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 16%, up 430 basis points versus Q4 last year. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 14.3% or 320 basis points higher than 2019. The increase in the tax rate was due to the substantial increase in pre-tax profit year-over-year coming in at our marginal tax rate. Average diluted shares were 400 million in Q4, about 2 million lower year-over-year, driven by the net impact of option dilution and share repurchases. For the full year, the average diluted shares were 399 million. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow was another great highlight for the year. We significantly increased net capital expenditure to accelerate the execution of our growth strategy while delivering a 67% increase in free cash flow. Cash flow from continuing operations was $8.3 billion, net capital expenditures were $1.5 billion and free cash flow was $6.8 billion. During 2020, we returned approximately $1.8 billion of capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends, and we ended Q4 with approximately $10.3 billion in cash and $21.7 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.1 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 1.1 times on a net debt basis. And concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 17.9%, up 610 basis points from Q4 last year as we generated exceptional returns in 2020. Now I'll provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments. And similar to last quarter, I'll start with some framing thoughts on the impacts that our COVID-19 response had on our segment results. From a revenue standpoint, the majority of the COVID-19 response revenue is recognized in Life Science Solutions. There's revenue -- this is revenue from testing kits, instruments, sample preparation and reagents for lab-developed tests recognized in the genetic sciences and biosciences businesses. This segment also includes revenue from vaccine and therapy production supplies recognized in the bioproduction and biosciences businesses. The Specialty Diagnostics segment includes revenue in the clinical diagnostics business from the molecular controls that go into testing kits. We also recognized revenue for viral transport media in the microbiology business and for test and PPE in the healthcare market channel. Laboratory Products and Services segment includes revenue from vaccine and therapy services for our -- from our Pharma Services business. This segment also includes revenue for PPE in the research and safety market channel as well as plastics used in testing workflows and cold storage equipment manufactured by our lab products business. From a margin standpoint, the impact of the COVID-19 differed across the segments based on the scale of the response revenue and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. In addition, during the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. This included investments in our colleagues in terms of incentive compensation and recognition as well as commercial, R&D and production capability investments. The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the COVID-19 response revenue in each segment, and so that does skew some of the reported segment margins. So a lot of moving parts from a segment margin standpoint reflects the very active management of the company, successfully navigating the current environment and position the company for an even brighter future. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Science Solutions. In Q4, reported revenue increased 138% and organic revenue growth was 134%. In the quarter, we saw exceptionally strong growth in our genetic sciences business and biosciences and bioproduction businesses. For the full year, reported and organic revenue growth was 77%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions increased 236%, and adjusted operating margin was 53.1%, up 16 percentage points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong volume pull-through and positive business mix, and we continued to make strategic investments across all businesses in this segment. We also had a tailwind on margins from FX. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 150% and adjusted operating margin was 50.2%, an increase of 15 percentage points over 2019. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 8% in Q4 and organic revenue growth was 5%. End markets for chemical analysis remain muted, but this was more than offset by strong growth in both chromatography and mass spectrometry and the materials and structural analysis businesses. We continued to see increased levels of customer activity in these businesses and drove strong commercial execution. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment declined 7% and organic revenue decreased 8%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments decreased 16% and adjusted operating margin was 20.2%, down 580 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we drove very strong productivity that was more than offset by the strategic investments that I mentioned earlier. We also had a headwind to margins from FX in this segment. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 37% and adjusted operating margin was 15.8%, a decline of 730 basis points versus prior year. Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q4, reported revenue increased by 109%. Organic revenue growth was 107%. Our COVID-19 response revenue was significant in the quarter, enabling us to deliver very strong growth in our microbiology, healthcare market channel and clinical diagnostics businesses. The level of routine diagnostics testing activity was higher in Q4 than Q3, but still remains below pre-pandemic levels, particularly for our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. For the full year, reported revenue was 44% higher than the prior year and organic revenue growth was 48%. Adjusted operating income increased 134% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 26.4%, up 270 basis points from the prior year. In Q4, we drove very strong volume leverage, which was partially offset by negative business mix and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 47% and adjusted operating margin was 25.6%, an improvement of 60 basis points versus prior year. And finally, in Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q4 reported revenue increased 28%. Organic revenue growth was 25%. In the quarter, we saw a strong growth in all our businesses in this segment, the research and safety market channel, laboratory products and pharma services. For the full year, reported revenue was 16% higher than 2019 and organic revenue growth was 13%. In Q4, adjusted operating income in the segment decreased 13% and adjusted operating margin was 9.4%, which is 440 basis points lower than the prior year. In the quarter, strong productivity and volume leverage was more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income declined 4% and adjusted operating margin was 10.4%, 210 basis points lower than the prior year. With that, I'll turn to our initial 2021 guidance. We're starting the year with annual guidance of 7% organic growth and adjusted EPS of $21.62, which will result in 11% growth over 2020. So another year of very strong financial performance. The dynamics around the pandemic continued to be fluid, but we thought it was important to give you our initial view of the full year, along with the associated assumptions to help frame how we're positioning the company for another successful year. We've chosen to go with a point outlook rather than a range because there are a multitude of different potential customer demand outcomes for the year, especially around testing. We remain incredibly well positioned to operate with speed at scale to uniquely serve our customers under any demand scenario that actually plays out this year. And at the same time, we'll continue to invest aggressively for very exciting near and long-term growth opportunities while delivering exceptional financial performance for shareholders. So just as we did in 2020, in 2021, we will maximize the opportunity to drive short and long-term value for all our stakeholders. Let me now provide you with the assumptions behind our initial guidance. In terms of revenue, our guidance is $35.1 billion, which represents approximately 9% reported growth over 2020, including 7% organic growth. There are 2 key elements to the organic growth assumption. First, the base business. Here, we're assuming 7% organic growth in 2021. The second element is the COVID-19 response. Here, we're starting the year with an assumption of $7.1 billion of revenue for 2021. This reflects testing-related revenue that's roughly the same as we delivered in 2020; plus approximately $1 billion of vaccine therapy-related revenue in 2021, which is double the level we generated last year. Let me give you some color on the phasing of the COVID-19 response revenue. We're assuming that vaccine and therapy revenue is fairly linear in 2021. The testing-related revenue is assumed to be very front-end loaded with Q1 levels similar to Q4 2020. Our guidance then assumes testing demand may begin to moderate in Q2 and potentially moderate further as the year progresses. Should the pandemic be longer lasting and the need for testing maintained, then this sizable upside to the $7.1 billion, particularly in the second half of the year. We're really well positioned to support our customers, should demand levels be higher than this initial guidance assumption. We'll have more clarity on the actual second half demand levels later in the year. With regards to FX, we're assuming a year-over-year tailwind of approximately $400 million of revenue or 1.2% and $0.14 of adjusted EPS or 1%. We're assuming that acquisitions will contribute approximately $125 million to our reported revenue growth in 2021. The initial guidance assumes an adjusted operating margin of 29.8%, 10 basis points higher than last year. Our PPI Business System will continue to drive strong volume pull-through and productivity benefits, will be partially offset by significant strategic investments adding to those made in 2020 that Marc outlined earlier. Moving below the line, we expect net interest expense in 2021 to be approximately $470 million. This is $20 million lower than 2020 due to lower average net debt. It includes the impact of the $2.6 billion debt paydown that we completed in January. We're assuming adjusted other net income will be about $8 million, lower by $32 million from 2020, mainly due to changes in non-operating FX. We expect the adjusted income tax rate to be 14% in 2021. The improvement from our 14.3% prior year tax rate is primarily driven by the benefits of our tax planning initiatives. We're assuming net capital expenditures of approximately $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. The midpoint represents an increased investment of $800 million over 2020, driven by capacity and capability expansions in our pharma services, bioproduction, biosciences and Laboratory Products businesses.  Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $7 billion in 2021. The increase over 2020 is primarily driven by expected earnings growth, partially offset by the increase in capital expenditure investments. Our guidance includes $2.8 billion of capital deployment. This consists of $1.5 billion of share buybacks, which we completed in January; $880 million for the recently completed acquisition of Novasep's European viral vector business; and it assumes approximately $400 million of capital returned to shareholders this year through dividends. We estimate that the full year average diluted share count will be approximately 398 million shares, and our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures. So it does not include the acquisition of Mesa Biotech, which is expected to close later in Q1. And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year as there are several factors to consider. First, note that we have 3 extra selling days in Q1 and 4 fewer days in Q4 in 2021, resulting in 1 less day for the full year. Then as I mentioned earlier, the COVID-19 response revenue included in the initial guidance is more significantly weighted to the first half of the year. And as a reminder, the 2020 comparisons are significantly easier in the first half of the year. So a lot of dynamics impacting the top-line growth by quarter, with very strong growth expected in the beginning of the year. From an adjusted EPS standpoint, we're expecting approximately 54% of the year's total in the first half of the year and 46% in the second half, reflecting very strong operational execution throughout the year. And then from a near-term standpoint, taking into account all of these factors, we're expecting Q1 organic growth and operating margin, the profile of those to be similar to Q4 2020. So at a high level, we're starting the year with guidance of 7% organic revenue growth and 11% adjusted EPS growth, a continuation of our excellent long-term financial performance track record. As always, we'll strive to deliver for the best possible results, and I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Kenneth Apicerno : Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : I'll start off by wishing Ken all the best, and great to work with you over the years. Marc, your implied testing drop off is steeper than we've heard from others like Hologic and [Abbott]. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit more about that dynamic in particular. Is that just a function of the non-automated PCR testing and maybe a lower installed base of the Amplitude? And then I'm curious about Mesa Bio, thoughts on increase -- entering an increasingly crowded point-of-care market. And are you planning to materially scale the antigen test? And how could that factor into the outlook? Marc Casper : Tycho, thanks for the question. Yes, I'm much more optimistic than the way you frame the question, right? So if I think about our PCR installed base and the assumptions, we have really strong line of sight to the first quarter, reasonable line of sight to the second quarter. And after that, our customers just don't know, right? So we made an assumption base that we're going to see incredibly strong demand in the first quarter. And that is going to drop off somewhat in Q2. And then we made a much more conservative assumption. But the way the pandemic has played out, there are many scenarios where I see testing demand being very robust for a long period of time. The truth is, this pandemic is going to be around in some form around the world, and doctors are going to want to know whether or not a patient or a person has COVID, right? So I think you'll see as the year plays out, there's scenarios well above the testing assumption. Amplitude demand has been extraordinarily robust. Our installed base is growing, and that's been a nice adder to the growth that we saw in Q4 and the strong momentum we expect. Mesa is very exciting, right? When you think about what we've learned throughout the pandemic is that PCR testing is truly the gold standard. And the accuracy that you get is super relevant and Mesa's technology gets you a result in 30 minutes with PCR capability, and it gives you that confidence in the accuracy. And the way we think about it is there are a number of applications that are very relevant to have that rapid thing. Pharmacies would be an obvious example. The sports leagues have been using this technology. So those will be examples of where it is, and that obviously will be additive to our capabilities. It's not assumed in our guidance at this point. So thank you, Tycho. Tycho Peterson : And then one follow-up for Stephen, just on the margins, understanding the 29.8% operating margin guidance. As we think about the gives and takes around the COVID tailwinds, can you maybe just talk as we think about COVID eventually wearing off, how much you expect to retain in terms of some of the margin uplift you've seen over the past year? Stephen Williamson : Yes. So when I think about the margin profile that's embedded in this guide, as I mentioned, Q1 similar to Q4 of 2020 and then the other 3 quarters are roughly the same in terms of margin profile. It's a combination of kind of lost contribution from the testing revenue drop off and then the timing of investments. So that gives you an indication. Operator : Your next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Derik de Bruin : And I'll extend my congratulations to Ken and Raf. Stephen, I just wanted to sort of follow up on Tycho's comment there. I mean for most of -- I would say, for a lot of the end of 2020, a lot of the incoming calls from investors were, oh my God, Thermo has this huge COVID tailwind. It's going to create these really difficult comps. They're not going to be able to grow earnings. Obviously, that's not the case in 2021, but it sort of flips the question now over to 2022. And I realize it's too early and a certain extent to really answer that question given all the uncertainty. But I mean all of my incoming questions this morning from investors are, well, the guide for '21 looks great. What -- how do they think about 2022? And I just -- I don't know any initial thoughts on how you can talk about that or if you can talk about potential for earnings growth in 2022? Marc Casper : So Derik, I've been around the -- I've been around this one a while. I've never been at the next year's guidance on the opening one, but it's a great question and it's one that is a very fair one as well. So the way I think about it is the following : First, think about the way we've managed the company throughout 2020, right, which was drive very substantial growth in our financial performance, earnings cash flow while dramatically accelerating the reinvestment rate in the business, right? New opportunities were opened during the course of the year because of the pandemic, because of how we responded, because of the relationships we solidified and build. And we were able to put $1 billion of additional reinvestment in the business above the normal increases that we have every year. And we're stepping that up again in 2021. So what does that mean for the future? It means that the company is positioned to grow more rapidly. And that obviously will drive good earnings off of that increased kind of base business activity. And much of the investments that we made that are supporting COVID are going to be applied to other applications. So obviously, vaccines and therapies we expect will continue to be very relevant in 2022. But at some point, they'll be less relevant. And that capacity, that all converts over to non-COVID-related activities. On the molecular diagnostics side, the installed base increase in sample prep and the installed increase in QPCR creates the opportunity to build out an even larger molecular diagnostic business. We increased our installed base hugely during the course of the year. And more importantly, we satisfy customers. The reason that some of the others in this industry have relatively flat straight-through the year results for COVID is because they couldn't get manufacturing capacity up, right? We were able to do that in months. Others are talking about level-loaded demand that's because the supply has been so constrained with others. So we're excited about our prospects. And obviously, we'll see what the economy is, what the growth is, all of those things. And as it gets much closer to 2022, we'll figure it out. But I'm extremely bullish about the long-term prospects of the company. Derik de Bruin : Great. I know it's a lot of this, what have you done for me lately sort of conversations. But you already took my -- you already answered my molecular diagnostics question. So I just have one quick follow-up. And just to clarify, the CapEx step-up in '21 -- 2021, that we would expect those levels to sort of fall off in 2022 and beyond, right? That's not a new base level CapEx spending. Marc Casper : No, we would expect -- I think Stephen will add, we would expect it to start to wind back down over time. Obviously, if there are new opportunities that come up, obviously support them because we'll take the returns. But effectively, the step-up in 2020 and the further step-up in '21 really support the opportunities that materialize and the long-term acceleration of our growth. Stephen Williamson : Yes. I think it's kind of a long, long-term modeling. It's really around about 3% to 3.5% of revenue is a good way to think about the profile of the company right now. Operator : And your next question will come from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : And also, congratulations, Ken; congrats, Raf. Well deserved. So wanted to dig into the guidance a little bit more. So around the assumption for vaccine therapeutic revenue fairly linear throughout the year, though we're obviously seeing the vaccine manufacturers scaling capacity into 2021. So could you just give a little bit more color around the framework behind the assumption? And are there any takes that you're assuming throughout the year? Stephen Williamson : So I think one framing is we were at that run rate already in Q4. So this is kind of how we're seeing the year play out with a continuation of where we are. So a very high level of support for our customers. And then can you just clarify the last part of your question about the take? Jack Meehan : Yes. Are there any projects that you think drop off throughout the year? Marc Casper : Yes. I mean there's always -- we obviously have supported a lot of development work of which some of those therapies or vaccines will be unsuccessful. So those projects conclude, but.. Jack Meehan : Embedded in that. Marc Casper : Embedded in the number, but obviously, the demand for the successful ones increase. So that kind of run rate we're at is not going to be the exact same products throughout the year. It ebbs and flows. Jack Meehan : Great. And then I wanted to turn to analytical instruments. As you reflected over the last 6 months, can you -- versus the first 6 months of 2020, how do you think could be purchasing demand translated throughout the year? Could there have been some catch-up in the second half? And then maybe looking forward, how does -- what are your assumptions around that segment for 2021? Marc Casper : Yes. So in terms of the demand profile, obviously, there was very substantial disruptions both in customers' ability to order or even receive an instrument during the first part of the year, and obviously, all of the other challenges that the pandemic brought. We saw activity start to pick up at a much stronger level, particularly in material and structural analysis, which is largely our electronic microscopy business and our chrome and mass spec business. So Q4, we're strong in those regards. Chemical analysis is still soft, though the bookings did improve. So what I would expect is that you'll see continued strengthening this year, and that analytical instruments would grow above the company average. That's how I would think about it. Operator : And your next question will come from Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Doug Schenkel : Before I get into it, once again, Ken, best wishes on the next stage. You deserve all the best, and congrats to Raf. We have always enjoyed working with you both and look forward to working with you both. Well, at least Raf moving forward and hearing about what Ken is doing on the beach. So first topic is, again, on guidance. 2021 guidance assumes a base business growth rate of 7%. According to our math, this implies a 2-year stacked growth rate of around 3.5%, which is well below your longer-term growth rate target and also the Q4 core growth rate. How would you characterize the conservatism embedded into 2021 guidance? Or is this kind of balancing early in the year conservatism, which is typical for you with maybe just seeing some increased headwinds related to COVID-19 restrictions in certain parts of your business? Marc Casper : Yes, Doug. So when I think about the base business, I feel good about the implied step-up in growth that we saw from Q4 for the full year, right, going from roughly 5% growth in the fourth quarter to 7% growth in the base business for the full year. And what's assumed in there is still there's some level of disruption based on the pandemic. Let me just visualize it. Our Specialty Diagnostics business, routine doctor business are still well down, right? So there's parts of the business where you don't see that recovery for a while. But we still feel confident in growing at a good rate. And I see scenarios that are above the 7%, right? So it's not as if that's the only scenario that plays out. So I don't know if -- I think it's an appropriate start. I don't know if it's conservative or not, but we measure ourselves at the end of the year, did we do a great job? So we're going to look at how did everybody else in the industry report, and we need to make sure that we're gaining market share. And if the 7% reflects market share gains, then we're going to be satisfied. And if there's more opportunity to go faster than that, then you're going to see us deliver it. Doug Schenkel : Okay. That's helpful. And then let me just pivot to China. China growth rebounded strongly in the fourth quarter. Actually, I -- we were looking back to our model over the years, and I think this represents the highest growth rate for at least the past decade in China on a quarterly basis. What drove the strength in China? Did you see some benefit of catch-up in spending? And then you made some comments in your prepared remarks, which prompted me to -- I guess prompted some curiosity about how your large molecule investments in China are actually impacting growth. And I guess the last part of this would be what's embedded for China growth in 2021? Marc Casper : Yes. So China, it was good to see, obviously, very disruptive first half of the year, 20%-ish organic growth in Q3 and 30% organic growth in Q4. So nice step-up, and Q4 was very strong. There was definitely some catch-up spend, right? I mean, obviously, customers getting back to work and all those things. So there was some of that in there. And that's pretty much impossible to quantify exactly what that is. But bookings were stronger than revenue growth, right? So we're excited about the growth prospects for China for this year, right? So China should be one of our fastest-growing geographies in 2021. So that would be the expectation. In terms of biologics and large molecule, we've talked about a lot on these calls over the years, the emergence of a local biotech industry for the Chinese market has become larger and larger over time. We've done a good job serving that customer base. I'm excited that we were able to localize our capacity for single-use technologies to support the local customer base and give them assurance of supply. And at the same point, we're very excited about the partnership and the joint venture reforming in Hangzhou to actually produce biologic drug substance and drug products. So we're well positioned there. And biotech is a nice driver of our growth. We also saw nice growth in other segments. Academic and government was quite strong in the quarter as well. So I hope that gives you a little bit of a flavor for what happened in China and what the strong outlook looks like. Operator : Your next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore. Vijay Kumar : Congrats to Ken and Raf. Marc, maybe a big picture question for you. Is there a view that the base business should be accelerating or perhaps has gotten stronger emerging from the pandemic? Some of the feedback we've been getting is higher installed base, biopharma accelerating. So perhaps some thoughts on what the base? I know the LRP pre-pandemic was 5 to 7. Is that LRP itself that math changing because the business is emerging more stronger from the pandemic? Marc Casper : Yes. So Vijay, thanks for the question. And yes, you've heard us talk about really starting in the Q3 call and the Analyst Meeting in September about how we're thinking about the longer term, right. And -- which goes back to the guiding principle that we have through the pandemic, which is make the decisions, investments and run the company to set ourselves up for a brighter future. We created new opportunities and new opportunities were created just in the market as well because of the pandemic. And when I think about that, we're positioning the company to exit the pandemic phase as a faster-growing company than what we grew, and the exact numbers will figure out over time. But the way I think about it is our -- the percent of our business in pharma and biotech continues to increase. That's our fastest-growing end market. So that's a market-driven weighted average type growth. But our value proposition, the increased investments in our innovation, the investments we're making in emerging markets, those things will all help us drive very strong growth going forward. So I'm very bullish about the long-term prospects for accelerated share gain into the long-term. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful. And one perhaps on free cash flows. The guidance, $7 billion, that's sort of flattish to up slightly year-on-year. If I just look at your cap deployment assumptions for the year, it's about close to $3 billion-ish, considering you guys have $10 billion plus on the balance sheet plus the $7 billion you're generating. And I don't think Thermo has ever -- had 2 consecutive years of $10 billion plus of cash lying on the balance sheet. I'm curious why free cash perhaps -- why is it $7 billion? Any one-off items? And any thoughts on cap deployment? Stephen Williamson : So Vijay, let me just clarify on the free cash flow. I think that includes a very significant increase in CapEx. So if you look about cash from operations, that's 13% growth year-over-year, which I think is incredibly strong and appropriately strong. And then we're choosing to deploy a large chunk of that towards these great opportunities in terms of CapEx. So that's kind of the -- get you to the $7 billion of free cash flow and the market in terms of capacity. Marc Casper : Yes. So we have had substantial capacity even when the company is more levered. And we've talked about that when we gave our 3-year models. We always have these numbers that are stagnantly large. We can deploy $30 billion wherever the numbers were historically back in '18 or '19 when we would talk about them. And when I think about where we are today, we have a lot of firepower. And you're seeing us be active right now with bolt-ons. We have a very busy pipeline, and we're going to be good stewards of capital. I mean we're going to be disciplined. We'll do the right things. We'll pass some of the things that we don't think are the right. It was good to get some return of capital already completed this year with $1.5 billion of buyback. So we don't look at the calendar and say, \"In any particular year, you have to do x or y.\" But I would expect us to be able to deploy that capital over time and be a nice adder to the strong financials that you're seeing in the initial guidance. Kenneth Apicerno : Operator, we have time for one more. Operator : Okay. So your final question for today then will be from Dan Brennan from UBS. Dan Brennan : Ken, obviously, have been great working with you and best of walk. The same thing with Raf, look forward to going forward. And Marc, a quick plug, things are looking up for our jets here. So I wanted to ask a first question on vaccine and therapeutics. I know you've addressed a few comments here thus far. I think on the last call, you discussed this $1 billion revenue cumulatively looking at 4Q '21 and '22. And I know to Derik's question, you addressed the outlook of some color on '22. I'm just wondering if you can help us think through kind of the durability. Obviously, there's a lot of moving pieces, but this $1 billion you're guiding for '21, presumably, there's going to be a pretty decent tail of this vaccine opportunity. Any way to help us think through that opportunity and how it breaks down between your tools business and [PPI]? Marc Casper : So Dan, thanks for the question, and the jets, not the best of years. But at least we were focused on a lot of things at Thermo Fisher. So I didn't suffer the pain too much. So when I think about vaccines and therapies, as you know, kind of our philosophy, which is articulate the numbers and the outlook on what you can see and don't create a lot of hype around things. So when we started out some months ago, we talked about $1 billion opportunity in total, right? That was contracted revenue that we saw. Obviously, as the pandemic continued, as our position continued, as we won more and more parts of the business, even what we committed to, if it all went to zero at the end of this upcoming year, it would be $1.5 billion because we did $0.5 billion last year, $1 billion this year. And based on what we see with the pandemic and what our customers are telling us, we would expect demand for COVID-19 therapies and vaccines to be very substantial in '22 and likely to have some level of revenue going into '23 and maybe even longer. So it's going to be a large contribution based on the strength of our bioproduction business and our pharma services capability. So thank you for the question. Marc Casper : Let me wrap here with a few things. First, as all of our analysts expressed and on behalf of all 80,000 colleagues, Ken, thank you for a job incredibly well done and wishing you the happiest of retirements. It's been awesome. From a company perspective, we delivered an exceptional year and we're even more excited about the opportunities ahead of us. We're looking forward to updating you during the course of 2021. And as always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This will conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to PPD's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Please note, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Tracy Krumme, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for PPD. Ms. Krumme, you may begin. Tracy Krumme : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today to share our results are David Simmons, PPD's Chairman and CEO; and Chris Scully, our CFO. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause material differences in our actual results. Please refer to our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of these risk. With the exception of revenue, all references to income statements results are on a non-GAAP basis. I would also like to remind you of a few important details, which are consistent with previous earnings calls. When referring to our financial performance, we'll be doing so on an ASC 606 basis. When referring to our commercial performance, including metrics related to net authorizations and backlog, we'll be doing so on a historical ASC 605 basis to maintain comparability with prior periods. Due to the recently announced transaction between PPD and Thermo Fisher Scientific, I would like to point out that we will not be conducting a Q&A session following our prepared remarks today. And with that, I'll turn the call over to David. David Simmons : Thank you, Tracy. And thank you all for joining us today. First, I'd like to start by highlighting the recent exciting news that we anticipate joining Thermo Fisher Scientific later this year. The opportunities to bring meaningful innovation to market faster and more efficiently, are as solid as ever. With that, I'm pleased to discuss our Q1 results. Since our IPO last year, we have now posted six consecutive quarters of solid financial performance as a public company. This achievement is first and foremost, a testament to the talent and culture we have at PPD and I would like to thank my colleagues for their continued dedication and relentless commitment to delivering high value services to our customers. Let me share a few Q1 highlights with you. We exceeded the high end of our guidance ranges for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and EPS. We posted a strong quarter of new business with net authorizations growth of 39% year-over-year. We had a backlog conversion rate of 12.4%. We realized year-over-year revenue growth of 29% with more than 25% growth in both our clinical and lab segments. And we delivered year-over-year EBITDA growth of 22%. Lastly, our balance sheet remained strong, with total liquidity of $1.4 billion and a net leverage ratio of 3.8 times, down from 4 times at year end. We entered the year in a position of strength, having grown our employee footprint by nearly 10% during 2020. We continue to build on this and for the second consecutive quarter grew our workforce by over 1,000 additional colleagues. We now have 27,000 employees around the globe and have maintained low turnover rates. As we welcome our new colleagues and continue to work on new and innovative development programs, the depth of our industry-leading expertise and experience continues to expand, bolstering one of the key differentiators of our performance. During 2020, we strengthened our relationships with both existing and new customers. As we remained agile in the face of the pandemic, and delivered on customer priorities, despite impediments. These relationships are flourishing as we expand our book of business with clients into new therapeutic areas or capabilities. Our experience, expertise and customer relationships have fueled continued growth in our backlog, which is well diversified across our clinical and lab segments, biopharma and biotech customers and therapeutic areas. Looking ahead, we will continue to innovate for the future. On past calls, I've shared the growth in the volume of our digitally-enabled and decentralized trials. And this past quarter, we were recognized by ISG, as a leader in digital, clinical trial solutions. We are also making strides in the real-world evidence base with additional data partnerships to build upon our leading capabilities in patient-centered research, modeling, and health economics outcomes research. As a testament to our offerings, we are seeing strong authorizations growth, proposed approval and real world evidence studies. We have momentum with our customers across both biopharma and biotech. We\u2019re well-positioned to take advantage of growing R&D spend with our expertise and experience in key therapeutic areas, strong customer relationships and continued innovation. Customers are seeking to progress development of their high value assets in the current environment, regardless of therapeutic area. And lastly, we've experienced a continuation of growth in our traditional portfolio of business, which represents the lion share of our backlog. With that, I'll hand it over to Chris. Chris Scully : Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. I'll dive right into our results. On the commercial front, net authorizations grew 39.3% over quarter one of last year, with double-digit growth in both the clinical and lab segments. The solid performance across the business contributed to a net book-to-bill of 1.46x, one of our highest levels in recent years. We closed the quarter with record ending backlog up 18.7% over quarter one of last year. With respect to the P&L quarter one revenue grew 28.5% over quarter one of last year, underpinned by 28.3% growth in clinical and 29.5% growth in labs. Adjusted EBITDA growth for the same period was 22.4%. Similar to last quarter, our revenue growth outpaced adjusted EBITDA growth, primarily as a result of a higher mix of indirect revenue on COVID vaccine studies, which resulted in optically lower adjusted EBITDA margin. Rounding out the P&L adjusted EPS grew 45.8% year-over-year to $0.35 a share. Turning to the balance sheet. We closed the quarter with cash of $826.4 million. With respect to our liquidity, our cash balance and available revolver capacity increased our total liquidity position to $1.42 billion as of March 31, up 60.7% over the same time last year. Our net leverage ratio at March 31 improved to just below 3.8 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA, down from 4.0 time at year end and 4.5 times at March 31 2020. I'm happy to report that this marks the achievement of our pre-pandemic commitment at the time of our IPO to move into the three times range in 2021. Before wrapping up, I'd like to echo David's comments about the exciting news as we anticipate joining Thermo Fisher Scientific later this year. We envisioned that the enhanced capabilities of the combined company, united by common missions will provide significant opportunities to enable our colleagues and customers to accelerate bringing new medicines to market faster and more efficiently. And with that, operator, we will conclude the call. End of Q&A: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you\u2019d like to ask a question during this time, simply press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, press the pound key. Thank you. I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may begin the call. Rafael Tejada : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com under the heading, News and Events until August 13, 2021. A copy of the press release of our second quarter 2021 earnings is available in the Investors section of our website under the heading, Financials. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company\u2019s future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from this indicated by the forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company\u2019s most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which are on file with the SEC and available in the Investors section of our website under the heading, Financials - SEC Filings. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates change, therefore you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.  Also during this call, we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our second quarter 2021 earnings and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading, Financials. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thanks Raf and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we executed on our growth strategy to deliver another fantastic quarter in Q2 with excellent growth on both the top and bottom line. As I reflect on the first half of the year, three things stand out to me : first, our team\u2019s exceptional execution operating with speed at scale to deliver on our growth strategy and gain share; second, we\u2019re already seeing the benefit of the accelerated investments we initiated in 2020; and third, the power of our PPI business system, which enables our performance. These three factors position us exceptionally well to deliver a fantastic 2021 and provide terrific momentum as we enter 2022. I\u2019ll cover each of these topics in more depth in my remarks, but first let me recap the financials. Our revenue in Q2 grew 34% year-over-year to $9.27 billion. Our adjusted operating income for the second quarter increased 44% to $2.69 billion and our adjusted operating margin expanded 200 basis points to 29% for the quarter. Finally, we delivered another quarter of exceptional adjusted EPS performance, achieving a 44% increase to $5.60 per share. Turning to our end markets, we continue to see excellent conditions driven by three factors : robust fundamentals in the life sciences, strong economic activity globally, and the role our industry is playing in the pandemic response. Our unique competitive position and excellent execution by our team has allowed us to gain share and deliver another outstanding quarter.  Starting with pharma and biotech, we had outstanding performance with growth of over 30% driven by strong underlying market conditions, the benefit of our unique customer value proposition, and our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our significant role in COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. We saw excellent growth across all businesses serving these customers, including bio production, pharma services, bio sciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry, and in our research and safety market channel. We are clearly benefiting from our trusted partner status that we\u2019ve earned over many years with these customers. In academic and government, we grew 35% this quarter. We saw very strong growth across our businesses supporting this customer base, especially in bio sciences, electron microscopy, and the research and safety market channel.  Turning to industrial and applied, we grew approximately 30% during the quarter as the team continues to execute at a high level to capture opportunities. In Q2, we had particularly strong growth in electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry business.  Finally in diagnostics and healthcare, we grew in the high teens during the quarter and we\u2019re seeing customer demand in our base business approach pre-pandemic levels. Our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses delivered outstanding growth. Also in diagnostics and healthcare, demand for COVID-19 testing related products grew to approximately $1.4 billion. Let me wrap up the end market recap with a quick comment on our role in the pandemic response. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have played the largest role in the life science tools and diagnostics industry in supporting the societal response and delivering critical solutions for our customers and governments around the world. In the second quarter, we generated a total of $1.9 billion, bringing our first half COVID-19 response revenue to $4.7 billion. One of the benefits of our response activity is the ability it gives us to accelerate investments and position the company for a phenomenal future. You know about the additions to capacity, capabilities and new products that we are making, and we are also continuing to invest in our colleagues. Building on our investments last year, we are again providing all non-executive colleagues with a special recognition payment of two weeks\u2019 additional pay to reflect the incredible contributions to our success. This is just one of the many measures we are taking to ensure we remain the employer of choice across the life sciences industry. Let me turn to the great progress we made in Q2 on our growth strategy, which is based on three pillars : launching high impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in the high growth and emerging markets, and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Let me give you a few examples. I\u2019ll start with innovation. We launched a number of new products across our businesses to further strengthen our industry leadership and enable our customers to accelerate scientific breakthroughs. Let me highlight a few.  In chromatography and mass spectrometry, we launched the new Thermo Scientific Orbitrap IQX Tribrid mass spectrometer which further extends the impact of our industry-leading Orbitrap platform to accelerate small molecule analysis for metabolized and other complex compounds. In our electron microscopy business, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Helios 5 EXL wafer dual beam scanning electron microscope, a very important tool to help semiconductor customers more efficiently ramp up production of new smaller and more complex microprocessors and memory devices. In our bio sciences business, we launched several new products including two instruments to advance cell analysis. The Invitrogen Bigfoot Spectral Sorter is a powerful cell sorting tool based on the technology we acquired from Propel Labs in Q1, and the Invitrogen Attune CytPix Flow Spectrometer, which offers enhanced imaging capability to enable researchers and cell therapy developers to better understand cell biology.  Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy, we continue to leverage our scale to create an outstanding experience for customers in the high growth and emerging markets. This has contributed to the excellent growth and share gain we are delivering across Asia Pacific. Let me cover a couple of the highlights. In China, we delivered strong growth of just under 30% in the quarter. The team is ramping up our new single use technology facility in Suzhou. In India, we demonstrated speed at scale at our genetic sciences facility in Bengaluru which shipped millions of COVID-19 PCR tests to support the country\u2019s response to the pandemic. We also have contributed $10 million in urgently needed products and donations to help India bring the crisis under control. Our performance across the region demonstrates that we\u2019re creating a differentiated experience for our customers and the significant investments that we\u2019ve made in these markets are fueling growth. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition, and we continue to increase our capabilities and capacity to be an even better partner for our customers and help them achieve their goals. Building on our significant investments last year, in 2021 we\u2019re executing on over $2.5 billion in capex to further expand our capacity and capabilities. It\u2019s exciting to see the continued progress of these investments. For example, during the quarter we brought additional capacity online around the world to support customers\u2019 production of vaccines and therapies. These include sterile fill/finish lines in Italy and Greenville, North Carolina, expanding our single use technology capacity in our facility in Logan, Utah, and adding to our Lithuania site for the production of essential raw materials used in the mRNA vaccines. These investments in our value proposition demonstrate our commitment to our customers who rely on us as an essential partner in their work. During the quarter, we announced a number of collaborations with leading academic medical centers. The combination of our innovation and our unique customer value proposition positions us to move science forward. For example, we\u2019re collaborating with the Mayo Clinic to develop more precise and personalized diagnostics for blood-based cancers, allergy, autoimmunity, and therapeutic drug monitoring. This work will leverage our insight and technology in clinical next-gen sequencing, immunology, and clinical mass spectrometry.  In addition, we announced that we\u2019ll build and operate a state-of-the-art cell therapy development, manufacturing and collaboration center at the University of California San Francisco to advance innovation in cell and gene therapy. These partnerships will lead to new capabilities for our customers and ultimately better outcomes for patients. As always, our PPI business system was a major factor in our success during Q2. This discipline and our mission-driven culture helps us to find a better way every day so we can continue to bring more innovative new solutions to our customers, work more efficiently and effectively, operate with speed at scale, and create even greater value for all of our stakeholders. Turning to capital deployment, we announced the acquisition of PPD at the beginning of the quarter. This acquisition will establish Thermo Fisher as a leader in the attractive and high growth clinical research services industry and add highly complementary services for our fastest growing end market. The integration plan is going extremely well. I\u2019ve been very impressed with the world-class talent I\u2019ve met during the integration planning process. We\u2019re looking forward to welcoming our PPD colleagues to Thermo Fisher upon closing of the transaction. Before turning to guidance, let me update you on our progress on our ESG initiatives. As the world leader in serving science, we know that our role goes beyond the work we do to enable our customers and value we create for our shareholders. It extends to our responsibility to make the world a better place. To that end, we continue to advance our sustainability initiatives. Yesterday, we announced our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This builds on our existing goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our operations by 2030. We\u2019re moving forward on this front by making our facilities more energy efficient, increasing our use of renewable energy, and reducing waste in our operations while also innovating across our portfolio to enable customers to meet their sustainability needs. This is aligned with our commitment to do business the right way and to fulfilling our mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. Now let me turn to our guidance for 2021.  Driven by our very strong start to the first half of the year and our confidence in the full year outlook, we\u2019re raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. Stephen will cover the assumptions behind our guidance, I\u2019ll cover the highlights. We\u2019re raising our revenue guidance by $300 million to $35.9 billion, which represents 11% reported growth over 2020. In terms of adjusted EPS, we\u2019re raising our guidance by $0.10 to $22.07, which will represent 13% growth over 2020.  Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize our key takeaways from Q2.  Our team is doing an outstanding job of executing our proven growth strategy to strengthen our competitive position. Our PPI business system is enabling our ability to operate with speed at scale. Our business is performing extremely well and gaining share. All of this enabled us to deliver excellent first half results and positioned us to deliver a fantastic 2021, and provides terrific momentum as we enter 2022. Finally, I\u2019d like to thank my 80,000 colleagues for their dedication to our company, our customers, and for once again delivering another excellent quarter. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks Marc and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll begin with a high level summary of our Q2 performance. We had another excellent quarter and grew our revenue 34%, including 28% organic growth. As Marc mentioned, our growth strategy is enabling us to take share on top of strong market conditions. As a result, in Q2 we were able to deliver 27% organic growth in the base business and continue our industry-leading response to the pandemic, generating $1.9 billion of COVID-19 response revenue in the quarter. Our PPI business system enabled us to generate excellent pull through on the very strong top line growth and is also enabling us to execute really well on our significant growth investments. As a result, we grew our adjusted EPS in Q2 by 44% to $5.60 and delivered $1.7 billion of free cash flow - overall, another excellent quarter. Now let me provide some more color on the Q2 performance. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.61, up 59% from Q2 last year. On the top line, our Q2 reported revenue grew 34% year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue increase included 28% organic growth, 2% from acquisitions, and a tailwind of approximately 5% from foreign exchange. As I mentioned, the base business organic growth was 27%. Turning to our performance by geography during the quarter, North America grew 25%, Europe grew 35%, Asia Pacific and China both grew just under 30%, and rest of the world grew low double digits.  Turning to our operational performance, Q2 adjusted operating income increased 44% and adjusted operating margin was 29%, 200 basis points higher than Q2 last year. In the quarter, our PPI business system enabled us to deliver very strong contributions from volume and productivity. We also had favorable business mix. This was partly offset by the ongoing strategic investments across our businesses to support our near and long term growth. Included in the investments in the quarter is over $100 million of supplementary cash bonuses for the non-executive colleagues, and we recorded a similar amount in Q1. This is to recognize the extraordinary work that our colleagues continue to do for our customers, communities and shareholders. Our ongoing investment in our colleagues and capacity and capabilities are ensuring a really bright future for the company. Moving onto the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 50.6%, flat to Q2 of the prior year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity and had positive business mix. This was offset by strategic investments. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 17.9% of revenue, a decrease of 200 basis points versus Q2 2020, reflecting strong volume leverage. Total R&D expense was approximately $340 million, representing growth of 29% versus Q2 2020 and reflects the increased investments in high impact innovation to fuel future growth. Looking at results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $111 million, $17 million lower than Q2 last year largely due to lower net debt. Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of $3 million, $13 million lower than Q2 2020 mainly due to changes in non-operating FX.  Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14%. This was 250 basis points versus Q2 last year due to the increase in pre-tax profit.  Average diluted shares were 396 million in Q2, about 2 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, the cash flow performance enabled by our PPI business system was very strong in the first half of the year. Year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $4.2 billion, up 88% from the same period last year. Year-to-date free cash flow was $3 billion, up 76% over the same period last year, and that\u2019s after investing $1.2 billion of net capital expenditure. This reflects the strong return we\u2019re generating in the short term and the investments we\u2019re making for the long term. We returned over $100 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This reflects the 18% dividend increase we announced in February. We ended Q2 with $7 billion in cash and $18.8 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.4 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA, and 0.9 times on a net debt basis. In concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 22.5%, up 10 percentage points from Q2 last year as we continue to generate exceptional returns.  Now I\u2019ll provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Similar to the last few quarters, I\u2019ll start with some framing thoughts on the impact of the COVID-19 response on our segment results. From a revenue standpoint, as was the case in the last three quarters, the majority of the COVID-19 response revenue is recognized in life science solutions with the remainder recognized in laboratory products and services and specialty diagnostics. From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 differed across the segments based on the scale of the response revenue and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. In addition, during the quarter we continued to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the COVID-19 response revenue in each segment, so that does skew some of the reported segment margins. Moving onto the segment details, starting with life science solutions, Q2 reported revenue in this segment increased 37% and organic growth was 29%. In the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong growth in our bio sciences and bio production businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in life sciences solutions increased 39% and adjusted operating margin was 48.3%, up 90 basis points year over year. In the quarter, we drove strong volume pull through and saw positive business mix, which were partially offset by the strategic investments. We also had a tailwind on margins from FX in this segment in Q2. In the analytical instruments segment, reported revenue increased 41% in Q2 and organic growth was 36%. During the quarter, we saw excellent growth in all businesses within this segment. Q2 adjusted operating income in analytical instruments increased 107% and adjusted operating margin was 18.9%, up 600 basis points year over year. During the quarter, we drove very strong volume and pull through and productivity, which more than offset the strategic investments that we\u2019re making across this segment. Turning to specialty diagnostics, in Q2 reported revenue in this segment increased 25% and organic growth was 21%. During Q2, we delivered exceptionally strong growth in the immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income increased 15% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 19.9%, down 170 basis points from the prior year. In Q2, the positive volume leverage and favorable business mix were more than offset by the continued strategic investments in this segment. Finally in the [indiscernible] products and services segment, Q2 reported revenue increased 29%, organic growth was 23%. In the quarter, we saw excellent growth in all our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 59% and adjusted operating margin was 12.4%, which is 230 basis points higher than the prior year. In the quarter we delivered positive volume leverage and favorable business mix, and that was partially offset by strategic investments.  With that, now let me turn to our updated 2021 guidance. As Marc mentioned, we\u2019re raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance, reflecting the strength of our Q2 performance along with a stronger outlook for the base business in the second half of the year. In terms of revenue, we\u2019re raising our full year guidance by $300 million to $35.9 billion and increasing our full year organic growth to 9%. The increase in revenue guidance is driven by three factors : an increase in the base business organic growth outlook for the full year from 8% to 12%, an updated assumption of $6.7 billion of COVID-19 response revenue for 2021, and a slightly more favorable FX tailwind than previously assumed. Let me give you additional details on each of these factors. Starting with the base business, here we\u2019re increasing the outlook by $850 million, reflecting our great Q2 performance and a stronger outlook for growth in the second half of the year. This increases our 2021 full year organic growth outlook for the base business by 400 basis points to 12%. Our end markets are very strong and we\u2019re executing very well on our growth strategy and increased strategic investments to drive excellent performance. Moving onto COVID-19 response revenue, our role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies continues to increase and we now expect $1.8 billion of related revenue in 2021, up $300 million from the prior guide. Approximately half that $1.8 billion was recognized in the first half of the year. Given the strength of both the base business growth and our vaccine and therapy response, we\u2019ve taken the opportunity in this revised guidance to significantly de-risk the outlook for testing. We\u2019ve lowered the full year testing related response revenue by $900 million from the prior guidance. We\u2019re now assuming it will be $4.9 billion for 2021, of which $3.8 billion was delivered in the first half of the year, leaving just over a billion dollars to go in the second half. There continues to be a wide range of outcomes for testing in the second half of the year. There are scenarios where the pandemic could increase in intensity, driving a higher need for testing. Should that be the case, we\u2019d be well positioned to support customer needs and will flow this benefit back through our P&L but for now, we thought it was prudent to take the opportunity to de-risk the outlook. The third and final element of the revenue guidance raise is FX. Rates continue to fluctuate. They went favorable to those from our prior guidance for most of Q2 and then moderated significantly. The net of this result is an increase in our FX revenue tailwind for the year, which is now assumed to be $525 million, up $50 million versus the prior guidance. Taking account of the different margin profiles of the revenue changes I\u2019ve just outlined, we\u2019re increasing our annual adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to $22.07, which will result in 13% growth over 2020. With the revenue mix assumed in the guide, we now estimate that the adjusted operating margin for the full year would be approximately 29.7%, in line with 2020.  The other elements of our guidance remain the same as the prior guide. Let me remind you of some of those assumptions. We\u2019ve not included any operational benefit in 2021 from the acquisition of PPD. When we get more clarity on the actual close date, we\u2019ll provide an estimate of any potential impact in 2021. We expect net interest expense in 2021 to be approximately $510 million. As a reminder, included within that number is $40 million or $0.10 of adjusted EPS as a placeholder for pre-financing for the PPD transaction. We expect the adjusted income tax rate to be 14% in 2021. We\u2019re assuming net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion, and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion in 2021. Our guidance still includes $3.8 billion of capital deployment, which is $2 billion of share buybacks which were completed in Q1, $1.4 billion for completed M&A, and $400 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. We estimate the full year average diluted share count to be 397 million shares. Finally, I wanted to touch on the phasing of revenue dollars and adjusted EPS for the remainder of the year. When I think about the split of the second half P&L between Q3 and Q4, we are assuming that the results will be slightly weighted to Q4. As you think about that split, remember the placeholder for PPD financing is all in Q4. To conclude, we delivered another excellent quarter and we\u2019re in great position to achieve our 2021 goals as we move into the second half of the year. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Raf. Rafael Tejada : Thank you Stephen. Operator, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys, congrats on a solid [indiscernible] this morning. Marc, one on the guidance here. Overall revenues were up, increased by $300 million for the year, but your COVID response revenues were lower by 600 and the implied math on base is it\u2019s up 850 million ex-FX contribution. That\u2019s a big number, and that\u2019s all coming here--you know, most of it seems to be in the back half. I\u2019m curious, what changed versus the prior assumptions, which segments are coming in better? Clearly we saw analytical tech come in better, and I\u2019m curious if it has any implications for fiscal \u201922. Marc Casper : Yes Vijay, thanks for the question. As I look at the base business outlook, really incredibly strong Q2. The performance, the 27% base business organic growth, the business is really firing on all cylinders, and orders were very strong. The informal dialog you have with customers is very bullish about market conditions and also, more importantly, our role in supporting them, and that gave us confidence that 12% organic growth for our base business activities is an appropriate guidance for the full year, so we feel really good about that. You\u2019re seeing the benefits of the acceleration in our growth strategy investments that we started in the second half of last year. You\u2019re seeing those things start to come into the new products that we launched, the collaborations, new capabilities. It\u2019s really a super exciting time, and we\u2019re excited about it in terms of what the fundamental outlook is for the base business. Vijay Kumar : Understood, and one for us, Stephen, on the margins here, I think you called it out, one time or maybe two weeks of extra pay. What was the impact, and is that expected to continue in the second half? I think you mentioned a billion dollars of testing in back half, and I think the comment you used was it\u2019s de-risked, so I\u2019m curious, do you have any tenders for orders that gives visibility into those numbers? Marc Casper : Stephen, why don\u2019t you do the margin, and I\u2019ll talk about the testing. Stephen Williamson : Yes, when we think about the mix of change in our guidance, it brought down the margin profile for the full year down to about 29.7%, which is down about 15 basis points from what I\u2019d assumed in my prior guide. That\u2019s kind of taken into consideration the different mix of contribution margins in the revenue changes. Marc Casper : Yes, and in terms of the response revenue and on the testing side of the equation, we took this strategy around de-risking the outlook. We had a strong quarter, actually, at $1.4 billion of testing, felt reasonably good about that, and we actually have a number of orders for the second half. We felt that given how much dialog there is around testing just generally and so much noise, we just felt that taking that off the table felt like the right thing to do, and we\u2019re well positioned, as you know, given our relationships and capacity. If things like the delta variant continue to drive more demand for testing, then obviously we\u2019re going to be higher than the number we assumed in the guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Doug Schenkel : Hey guys, can you hear me? Marc Casper : Perfectly. Doug Schenkel : Okay, sorry about that. I had some technical difficulties. I guess a question as we think about 2022, and I know you\u2019re not going to guide on this call and I\u2019m going to apologize for-- Marc Casper : Don\u2019t apologize. Doug Schenkel : But I mean, at some level, to maybe just cut to the chase, is it reasonable to take the three-year revenue and EPS targets from your 2019 analyst day at the mid to high end, layer in some lingering COVID-19 relief revenue at the top and bottom line, and then add in whatever we\u2019re going to model for PPD and basically take those three components and add them up and use that as kind of a construct for thinking about 2022? Is there any reason to not just boil it down to that construct at this point? Marc Casper : Doug, I\u2019m going to give you terrific news, which is we\u2019re going to hold an analyst day on September 17 and we\u2019re going to give some early thoughts about 2022 to help with some of the ways to think about modeling, and not what I would call official guidance for the year but at least some scenarios to help that, and then give the three-year outlook going forward. We thought an analyst day would be the best way, because we think it\u2019s a great question. What I would say, as you think about between now and whatever it is, seven weeks now, as for 2022, the performance of the base business is super cool - you know, 12% organic growth. We\u2019re going to be entering the year with a very strong order book with very strong momentum, and more and more of those investments that we\u2019ve made and are making positions us for great momentum in 2022.  We\u2019re going to play a meaningful role in what our customers need on their response, right? 2022 seems like a long way off, but I\u2019d say obviously vaccines and therapies are going to be super relevant and there will be testing, the question is at what level. We\u2019ll try to do some scenarios to help with that, but nobody knows what the demand is going to be for testing next year, so there will be range of outcomes around that, but I\u2019m excited. PPD, obviously you\u2019d add whatever assumptions for next year to the numbers from a capital deployment perspective, so 2022 is going to be another great year for the company. Doug Schenkel : Okay, all right. Thanks for that, Marc. Then I guess as my follow-up, maybe I\u2019ll just throw the two quick ones out there. The first is as you know as well as anybody, there is a ton of labs globally that built out new infrastructure for COVID-19 testing using Thermo products. What are you seeing at these sites now? Testing volumes, they\u2019re slowing but still robust. What I\u2019m curious about is as we move towards the fall, are you seeing these labs move more into four-in-one testing, and then I guess beyond that, is there any move toward broader infectious disease testing at these sites, because I think that would help us as we think about the durability of what\u2019s occurred in that category. Then the other one I just want to sneak in for Stephen, COVID-19 revenue has clearly been a boon to operating margins. That said, underlying margin seems to be tracking quite nicely. Maybe I should be able to do this math real quick, but I haven\u2019t. I\u2019m just wondering, if you take COVID-19 revenue contributions out of your 2021 targets, where do you believe 2021 operating margin would come out? Thank you. Marc Casper : Those would be good two or three-hour long conversations, but I\u2019ll take a shot at it, and Stephen, certainly feel free to add. When I think about the COVID testing demand and what are we seeing, what I would say is we obviously have built--we have and had built during the pandemic a huge installed base around the world. For us, the activities we do across all of the countries is the huge driver of our activity, so a lot of what we read about is what\u2019s going in the U.S., and the U.S. testing demand is definitely less at this moment, although obviously cases are starting to increase, but there\u2019s quite a bit of demand around the world and certain customers are preparing for a respiratory panel for the winter season, and obviously we\u2019ll have that. We\u2019re going to support our customers at whatever level of demand that they need. In terms of margins, I\u2019ll make it sort of what\u2019s the philosophy, and then Stephen, if you want to add, feel free. We\u2019re not thinking about it base business versus COVID, we\u2019re thinking about how do we manage the company appropriately in terms of the profitability of the company and the investment rate for the going forward. I think one of the things that if you kind of do very simple math, and I\u2019ll do it from an EPS perspective, we raised our--based on the very strong outlook for the year and the very strong first half, we raised our EPS by $0.10 in the guidance. We chose to invest another $0.25 in our colleagues, right - the $100 million in the Q2 additional payment is an investment in the future, right, so we made a conscious decision. Obviously margins are very strong and we\u2019ll manage that appropriately. It really highlights the power of our PPI business system. Stephen Williamson : Yes, we\u2019re really just focused on that. When you maximize the top line opportunity, invest appropriately for the future, it pays--we\u2019re getting great--we\u2019ll get the right returns off that investment, and then the flow through then comes, so it\u2019s less that we\u2019re trying to manage to a margin expansion number than appropriately manage the P&L and invest appropriately for the future. Marc Casper : Thanks Doug. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research Jack Meehan : Thank you, good morning. Marc, was hoping you could give us your latest thinking on capital allocation within the--you know, if I go back to the 2019 analyst day, you talked about $29 billion of deployment through 2022, though I think there\u2019s a view in the market that it could be a lot higher than that because of the COVID response sales, so my question is what\u2019s your latest view on ability to close deals as the multiples seem to be moving higher, and if not, why not do more buybacks? You\u2019ve only done $3.5 billion since the beginning of 2020. Marc Casper : Jack, thanks for the question. In terms of capital deployment, first of all, it\u2019s been an active year between--and I\u2019ll give you an update on PPD in a minute, but it\u2019s been an active year. We obviously announced PPD, we\u2019ve done a number of smaller bolt-on transactions, so we\u2019ve been active. Our pipeline is quite busy. We\u2019re looking at things, we\u2019re disciplined, and because our industry is so large and fragmented, we\u2019re seeing opportunities to continue to build on our M&A strategy and execute against that, so from that perspective things are good. From a return of capital perspective, we felt the $2 billion that we did in terms of buybacks and increasing the dividend felt like the right return, given the M&A commitments we\u2019ve made to PPD, and we certainly revisit our return of capital mix with our board periodically and we\u2019ll continue to do so. But right now, we continue to have M&A as the primary focus.  PPD, I\u2019ll spend a moment there because it\u2019s a large commitment of capital. I\u2019ve been super impressed with the team. I\u2019ve gotten to meet a number of the team because of the integration planning. It\u2019s going very smoothly, the colleagues are very excited to become part of the company. As you see from some of the other companies in the CRL field that are reporting, the end markets are super good, the industry is doing well. PPD as a leader is very well positioned, so this is going to be a really good growth asset.  From the pathway to closure of the transaction, we\u2019ve gotten most of the direct investment, the foreign investment approvals done, still got a little bit left to do there but that\u2019s pretty much done. We\u2019re working our way through the various anti-trust filings around the world, we\u2019re collaborating with the FDC on second request, and we\u2019re looking forward to closing the transaction by the end of the year, so that\u2019s a quick recap on capital deployment. Stephen Williamson : Yes, and Jack, one thing to add. When I think back to 2019, the outlook around that use of cash and ROI, we put significantly higher investments in capex. We\u2019ve identified some great opportunities to invest organically, and we\u2019re putting cash to work and getting great returns in really a short period of time as well, so that\u2019s another element as I think about how the company\u2019s evolved over that period of time. Jack Meehan : Yes, definitely hear you on that. Just as a follow-up either for Marc or for Stephen, there\u2019s been a lot of discussion around inflation across the market, so I was curious to get your view, just ability to toggle pricing as a lever in the channel, how that is going, and then any thoughts around the supply chain, have you had any issues? Stephen Williamson : Yes, I think when you look at the world, it\u2019s unwinding from the recessionary impacts of the pandemic, and as a result you\u2019ve got kinks in supply chain and clearly inflationary pressures in multiple different places. How large that impact is and how long it lasts for is still to be proven out. We\u2019re operating on the basis that it will be with us for some time. Our PPI business system enables us to effectively navigate events like this and run our operations efficiently, use our scale to partner with suppliers, and then maximize opportunities, as you mentioned, around pricing for certain products to help protect our margins. That\u2019s not just [indiscernible] really across the portfolio, that\u2019s kind of the scale benefit of using our pricing discipline across the company, and we\u2019ve navigated through this dynamic really well through the first half of the year, and I expect us to continue to do so going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Tycho Peterson : Hey, good morning. Marc, I\u2019m wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the recovery in analytical instruments. I know you said it was widespread, but you did call out electron microscopy a couple times, so could you maybe just talk to that dynamic, how much of that do you think is pent-up demand how much of that is tied to the semi-cycle? Just curious for some more color there. Marc Casper : Tycho, good morning, thanks for the questions. Yes, our analytical instruments business performed extremely well, grew over 35% in the quarter, and all three businesses really performed very well - chemical analysis, chrom and mass spec, and materials and structural analysis [indiscernible]. When I think about the dynamics here, our new products, they\u2019re very exciting, I mentioned a few of them this quarter as I did last, so the investments we\u2019ve been making in R&D there are really paying off, and the end markets are good. You see that in electron microscopy, both in the adoption of the tools for life sciences applications, so the cryo electron microscopy, but you also see that across the material science applications, including semiconductor, and obviously from everything you read around what\u2019s going on in chip supply and investments there, that bodes well for the electron microscopy business for sure. Tycho Peterson : Okay, thanks. Then for the follow-up, I\u2019ve actually got two quick ones. On COVID, I think you made a prudent move to take testing down. Just curious your latest thoughts on the durability on the vaccine and therapy side, what you\u2019re hearing from customers, obviously a lot of focus on boosters now. Then on margins, I know a lot of people are focused on 2022 operating margins. You did take up R&D by 20% last year, so maybe another way to ask the question is, how much of the opex do you think will carry through, or do you think you\u2019ll reset R&D a little bit to drive more leverage? Thanks. Stephen Williamson : Tycho, let me cover the margin question. I think the elevated investments are getting great returns, so we\u2019re going to manage the company appropriately, spend appropriately, and have fueled really strong base business organic growth going forward. Should those returns not be in the right places, we\u2019re going to obviously appropriately manage spend, and then as the pandemic response unwinds, we will appropriately deal with the variable costs that go with that and manage the P&L appropriately. We look forward to giving more details when we\u2019re in a better position to do that around 2022. Marc Casper : Tycho, in terms of the role that we\u2019re playing in supporting the vaccines and therapies for COVID, it\u2019s quite significant, right, and it cuts across both our pharma services capabilities for the active ingredients [indiscernible] as well as in the sterile fill/finish activities for the vaccines. We play obviously a very substantial role as the technology provider in our bio sciences business with things like enzymes, nucleotides, as well as in our single use technologies and cell culture media, so a very large role. We expect that to be about $1.8 billion this year. Demand is very robust, right, so for the industry it\u2019s mostly about capacity coming online to support the demand, so we look at our momentum going into 2022, we would expect that the vaccine and therapy demand to be very strong given the likely demand for the response to the pandemic, and as our capacity comes more and more online, that positions us very well to meet the strong backlog of orders that we\u2019ve been able to generate because we have the right solutions for our customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel. Dan Arias : Good morning guys, thanks for the question. Marc, on the new plasmid production site out in Carlsbad, I think you just opened up there, so when do you expect to be fully scaled up and going? Is there anything you can say about the extent to which capacity has already been booked there, just given that it sounds like that\u2019s a pretty supply constrained area? Then I think you\u2019re supporting mRNA vaccine work out there and I\u2019m just curious whether you\u2019re starting to talk to customers about projects maybe down the road with them on mRNA vaccines that are not related to COVID. Just thinking one of the open questions here is where are we headed with mRNA now that we have some proof of concept. Marc Casper : Dan, great question. A few different things that are going on. Let\u2019s do the mRNA more broadly first. There has been a huge increase in investments in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry given the success that mRNA has had on the COVID vaccine, so that investment is both in next generation vaccines, combination vaccines, as well as just in the class of other diseases altogether. And yes, we\u2019re in numerous dialogs in supporting those activities across our capabilities, so that\u2019s a wonderful tailwind for our largest segment of pharma and biotech in terms of customers, so that looks very strong. One of the things that we have seen is that in plasmid DNA, there has been a shortage of capacity for some period of time, and we\u2019ve been addressing that by making significant organic investments. We have been able to secure meaningful orders for our new facility in Carlsbad. I had the opportunity to visit the facility in June - it\u2019s awesome and super exciting. It\u2019s open - and we just did the ribbon cutting in early July, and we\u2019ll be producing product in the not distant future there and building momentum on that, and that\u2019s great. The customer base wanted choice and we\u2019re giving them choice, and we\u2019re excited about that. Dan Arias : Okay, appreciate that. Maybe just Stephen, just thinking about some of the other parts of bio production, on Novasep, I think the outlook last time was for $150 million in contributions from Novasep. Is that still the current outlook, because I felt like that was conservative last quarter just given that you had done almost half that, if not a little bit more than half that in Q1 alone, so just wanted to check. Stephen Williamson : Yes, we secured some additional orders on the COVID response and it\u2019s slightly higher - it\u2019s about another $30 million to $40 million for the year, and that\u2019s included in that increasing guide for the response revenue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Derik de Bruin : Hi, good morning. A couple questions. I guess on the first one, can you talk a little bit about the China market - obviously it wasn\u2019t going to be as strong in the second quarter as it was in the first quarter, the growth, just given that China started to recover in the second quarter, but it was a little bit lower than I would have thought. Can you talk about the dynamics in the Chinese market? Marc Casper : Yes, China is performing very well. When I think about the growth in the quarter of just under 30%, we\u2019ve got 40% growth in the first half. I spent time with the team, activities have returned to pretty much normal. The [indiscernible] five-year plan is being implemented and that has tailwinds for our industry, and Thermo Fisher is well positioned to capitalize also, so I think about China in terms of our outlook and it\u2019s off to a good start through the first half of the year. Derik de Bruin : Got it. I\u2019m going to squeeze two in. I guess the first one is, can you talk a little bit about academic and government and what you\u2019re seeing in that market? That 35% growth, is any of that, do you think, tied to new funding that\u2019s coming up, is there a pick-up or is that just catch-up spending? Then another question I keep getting from people is I still think there\u2019s some concern over the impact of PPD on the margin, given it\u2019s more of a people business than a razor and blade business. Just your general thoughts on the margin opportunity in PPD, thanks. Marc Casper : Yes, so Derik, academic and government had a very good quarter, 35% growth, that\u2019s exciting. As you think about academic and government, obviously it was one of those segments of the four end markets we serve that was very affected last year in 2020 because of the pandemic, and in the second quarter, that\u2019s really the place you saw it the most. What you\u2019re seeing now is largely activity has returned back to normal around the world - I mean, it might be different, but actually the activity level is pretty normal, and what I\u2019m encouraged about is two things . One is widespread in terms of the performance across our businesses - you know, bio sciences, research and safety market channel that talks about activity is very high, and electron microscopy really excellent funding, so it talks about sort of the big capital funding there also was strong. Then when you look going forward, that really does look good because there\u2019s so much positive talk around the world about the funding. Stephen Williamson : Then on PPD, Derik, the margin profile of that whole industry is significantly lower than the company average, and knowing that eyes wide open going into this, the investment thesis in this asset is that margin expansion--we\u2019ll get some margin expansion from cost synergies, but it will be lower than the company average expansion year-over-year but be higher than average growth business. When you think about the growth in operating income dollars, it will be very equivalent to the rest of the company, so it\u2019s just a slightly different P&L profile that we\u2019re bringing into the company and you need to factor that is as you\u2019re thinking about modeling the company going forward. It\u2019s a scale business coming in at lower than the average margins, but that doesn\u2019t change the margin profile or the margin opportunity for the rest of the company and doesn\u2019t change the great outlook that we think PPD has, and we\u2019re excited about bringing it into the company. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Great, thanks for taking the questions, guys. Marc, maybe one on the specialty diagnostics business - you know, it came in a bit lower than we expected. Obviously a big chunk of that is the COVID testing piece, but can you just talk about the core business trends there, what the recovery path looks like in the back half? Marc Casper : Yes Patrick, thanks for the question. When I look at the specialty diagnostics business, actually underlying what\u2019s going on in the business actually is quite encouraging. Activity levels are pretty much back to the pre-pandemic levels. You see it in really strong growth in our immunodiagnostics business, allergy and autoimmunity. You see it in our transplant diagnostic business. [Indiscernible] businesses were highly disrupted a year ago when procedures were put on hold, but you also saw good growth in microbiology, you saw it as well in our healthcare market channel, so it\u2019s encouraging. In terms of the--you know, you do see some of the COVID response revenue there as well, and that will have a more challenging comparison in the second half, but I feel good about the underlying outlook within specialty diagnostics. Rafael Tejada : Operator, we have time for one more question. Marc Casper : I think Patrick just--[indiscernible]. Patrick Donnelly : Yes, sorry, just a quick one on PPD. I know, Marc, you mentioned second response from the FTC. Just a quick update there in terms of any surprises from what the discussion has been and the confidence level there in getting that done. Thank you. Marc Casper : No, no surprises there. We\u2019re just working through the process and we\u2019ll work collaboratively and look forward to bringing it to a close at the end of the year. Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question. Operator : Your last question will come from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink. Puneet Souda : Yes, hi Marc, Stephen. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick clarification for Marc--actually, for Stephen. On the COVID related, a number of points have been covered, but just in terms of the Mesa acquisition, I know you had highlighted a contribution there, maybe closer to $200 million or so. Does that still remain, or was that removed in part of the de-risking that you mentioned?  Then Marc, just broadly speaking, you mentioned a number of times Orbitrap platform continues to grow. This has been a decade-plus growth opportunity for the company. Could you, maybe just on a very high level, give us a view on where that stands today and where do you expect that to go over the next few years, and if just given the high growth areas of bio pharma and [indiscernible] where its levered to, so I\u2019d appreciate some thoughts there. Thanks so much. Patrick Donnelly : Thanks Puneet. In terms of Mesa, we\u2019re scaling up the manufacturing capacity, we\u2019re working for the longer term as well for building out the menu. It\u2019s a really exquisite technology, so we\u2019re very excited about it, and the revenue assumptions remain the same as where they were last quarter, so from that perspective, very positive. When I look at the Orbitrap, what a phenomenal technology. It continues to drive very good growth for our analytical instruments business, super relevant for our customers, and we\u2019re able to continually push the technology forward to bring out more and more relevant solutions. The most recent launch really is focused on complex small molecule analysis, but you\u2019re also planning on the technology being used in the multi-attribute method for biologics in terms of QAQC, which is a very large market opportunity and we\u2019re well positioned there, so I feel great about the performance of our chrom mass spec business and even more excited about what the future holds there as well. Puneet, thank you for the questions, and I\u2019ll turn to just wrapping it up here. Marc Casper : We really had an excellent first half of the year. We\u2019re on track to deliver another outstanding year and we\u2019re going to enter 2022 with great momentum that sets us up for a very bright future, and we\u2019re looking forward to sharing more about our future during our virtual analyst day on September 17, and of course then updating you in October on our Q3 call.  As always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks everyone.",

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thanks, Raf. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our Third Quarter call. We delivered another outstanding quarter, achieving exceptional financial performance while continuing to effectively execute our growth strategy to make Thermo Fisher Scientific an even stronger partner for our customers. As I reflect on the year so far, three things stand out to me. Our proven growth strategy powered by our PPI Business System is driving outstanding financial performance. Our base business is performing very well and we're playing a leading role in our industry's response to COVID-19. And we continue to build on our trusted partner status with innovative new products and expanded capabilities to further enhance our unique customer value proposition.  All of this gives me great confidence and a very bright future as we continue to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders, I will get into more detail on these in my remarks later. But first, let me recap the financials. Our revenue in Q3 increased to $9.33 billion, growing 9% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $2.78 billion and our adjusted operating margin was 29.8% for the quarter. Finally, we increased adjusted EPS by 2% - $5.76 per share.  So another outstanding quarter. Turning to our end markets in Q3, market conditions were strong and our team executed well to deliver another fantastic quarter. Starting with Pharma and Biotech, we continue to have outstanding performance in this end market with growth of just over 20% driven once again by strong market dynamics, our unique customer value proposition, and our leading role in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas including our significant role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. Our trusted partner status earned over many years with these customers continues to drive robust growth. In this end market, we saw a broad-based strength, including in our bioproduction, pharma services, Biosciences, chromatography, and mass spectrometry businesses, as well as in the Research and Safety market channel. In academic and government we grew in the mid-single-digits in the quarter with very good growth in Biosciences, and the Research and Safety market channel.  Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the mid-teens. In Q3, we had particularly strong growth in our electron microscopy business and in the Research and Safety market channel. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, we declined 11%. Performance in our base business was strong, driven by immunodiagnostics, clinical diagnostics, and transplant diagnostics.  The team also executed very well to support customers COVID-19 testing needs, delivering $1.55 billion of revenue this quarter versus $1.8 billion in Q3 last year. Before I move on to our growth strategy, let me provide a few comments on our industry-leading role in the pandemic response. In the quarter, we generated $2.05 billion in COVID-19 response-related revenue. With the surge in the Delta variant, we saw a strong testing demand around the world in Q3. We also played a very meaningful role in vaccines and therapies for COVID-19 generating just over $500 million in the quarter from these activities.  The underlying demand for our product and service offerings used in the production and development of vaccines is very robust and over time, we expect this demand to transition to non-COVID revenue. Our industry-leading response to the pandemic has enabled us to accelerate our growth strategy, strengthen customer relationships, and accelerate investments, which contributed to our ability to raise our long-term core organic growth guidance to 7% to 9% as we communicated at our recent Investor Day. Let me now give you an update on our growth strategy, which consists of three elements. Continuously developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale on the high-growth in emerging markets and delivering unique value proposition to our customers. Let me provide a few examples of how we're delivering on our growth strategy.  Starting with innovation, we launched a number of new products across our businesses to further strengthen our industry leadership and enable our customers to accelerate scientific breakthroughs and make the world a better place. In our genetic sciences business, we launched the Applied Biosystems Quantz Studio Absolute Q Digital PCR system. This is the first fully integrated Digital PCR system featuring simplified workflows and designed to provide highly accurate results in only 90 minutes. This system will help events our customers innovation efforts in areas like oncology and cell and gene therapy. And chromatography and mass spectrometry, we launched three new Thermo Fisher Scientific TSQ plus triple quadruple mass spectrometers to address the growing need for faster throughput and increased sensitivity across a range of applications in Biopharma and applied science, including clinical research for large and small molecules, toxicology from Safety and environmental analysis. We also launched the Thermal Scientific Vanquish NEO UHPLC system and the Thermo Scientific Tech map Neo, UHPLC columns designed for use in proteomics precision medicine, and translational research.  Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy, we continue to leverage our scale to create an outstanding experience for customers and high-growth in emerging markets. This has contributed to the excellent performance we are delivering across Asia-Pacific, where we delivered growth in the low double-digits during the quarter. We continue to build our presence and capabilities in the region. During the quarter, we opened a bioprocess design center in South Korea. This facility features laboratory and educational space and more than 100 instruments that support pharmaceutical research and manufacturing processes. This center will help our pharm and biotech customers advance their important work.  Our performance across the region demonstrates that we're creating a differentiated experience for our customers, and the significant investments we've made in these markets are fueling growth. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition. And we continue to increase our capabilities and capacity to be an even better partner for our customers and help them achieve their goals faster and more efficiently. As I mentioned last quarter, we're executing on over $2.5 billion in Capex this year. Let me give you a brief update on our progress. Building our pharma services capabilities in Q3, we brought on additional capacity online to support vaccine and therapy production. As part of the previously announced strategic partnership with CSL limited, we assumed operating responsibility for our new state-of-the-art biologics site and like now in [Indiscernible] The site will feature highly flexible bioproduction technologies, including single-use and stainless steel to provide a pathway from development to large-scale production as customers needs evolve. To support growing demand in the biopharmaceutical industry, we announced plans to open a new bioproduction facility in Nashville, Tennessee to manufacturer single-use technologies. The facility will be one of our largest SUT sites in the world. In addition to support disease research and diagnostic testing, we announced our commitment to co-invest with the U.S. government in building a state-of-the-art facility to manufacturer pipette tips. The new facility will be located in North Carolina and designed in line with Thermo Fisher Scientific's carbon neutrality goals. These investments are value proposition, demonstrate our commitment to our customers who rely on us as an essential partner in [indiscernible]. Now, let me give you a brief update on capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined strategy for capital deployment, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In terms of M&A, we are super excited for acquisition of PPD. The business is performing well.  The regulatory process is on track, and we expect to close by year-end. As a reminder, PPD will establish Thermo Fisher as a leader in the attractive and high-growth clinical research services industry and yet highly complementary services for our fastest-growing end market. Integration planning is going very well. Financing is largely complete, and we're looking forward to welcoming our PPD colleagues to Thermo Fisher later this year. Before turning to our guidance, let me update you on our progress we're making on our ESG initiatives. As the world leader in [Indiscernible] science, we know we have a responsibility to use our industry leadership position to make the world a better place.  And to that end, we continue to advance our sustainability and social impact initiatives. During the quarter we committed to expand our use of ACT product labeling to include our entire cold storage portfolio by the end of the year. ACT labeling clearly details environmental impact of the product, empowering our customers to make sustainable choices and ultimately helping them achieve their own goals for environmental stewardship. Our 90,000 colleagues are also passionate about the difference they can make. And our local site-based community action counsels support a number of charitable and stem education activities throughout the year. We have amplified our -- supporting these efforts by investing in additional $15 million in our foundation for science.  And we continue to support the historically black colleges and universities to deliver accurate COVID-19 testing to students and staff, helping to ensure campus safety and the ability to confidently deliver in-person learning. With that, I'd like to review our guidance at a high level, and then Stephen will take you through the details. As you saw on our press release, we're raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. This increase is a result of our strong Q3 operational performance in our base business. And the continued strength of our COVID-19 response revenue.  We're raising our revenue guidance by $1.2 billion to $37.1 billion, which would result in 15% revenue growth over 2020. In terms of adjusted EPS, we're raising our guidance by a $1.30 to $23.37 per share, which represents 20% growth year-over-year. The 2022 guidance raise reflects the increased Outlook for the core business and adds to the very strong Outlook that we shared with you at our Investor Day. We're raising our 2022 full-year revenue guidance by $200 million to $40.5 billion, and increasing our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.20 to $21.36. To summarize our key takeaways from Q3, we executed very well to continue our growth momentum, and deliver excellent revenue in earnings performance. Our business is performing very well and we continue to play a leading role in the pandemic response.  We continue to expand our trusted partner status with innovative new products and expanding capabilities to further enhance our customer value proposition. And our exceptional performance through the third quarter enabled us to raise our outlook for the year and sets us up for an even brighter future. With that, I will now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen. Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc. And good morning everyone. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with a quick reminder about the definition of core business. This is a term we introduced at our recent Investor Day. Core includes our base business and the vaccines and therapies response revenue, and of course core will also include the PPD acquisition. So moving on to the details in Q3, it was another excellent quarter.  Let me provide a high-level view of how the quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call in July. Yet the broad-based beat versus the prior guide. Revenue was $1.2 billion higher, driven by $900 million higher testing response revenue, $250 million higher core business revenue, and $50 million more favorable core-FX. On our last earnings call, our guidance de-risk testing response revenue and we said that if there were any additional opportunities to support customer's testing needs, we'd be ready to do so and flow the benefits through our P&L.  That's exactly what we did in Q3, in total delivering $1.55 billion of testing response revenue in the quarter. We also had a great strength in the core business. In Q3, the base business organic growth was 10%, which is 3%, or $190 million higher than included in our prior guide. Also in the core, vaccines and therapies response revenue was $60 million higher than in that prior guide, and worth $510 million for the quarter. So excellent momentum on the top-line. Our PPI Business System enabled us to generate excellent pull-through on the very strong top-line performance. And at the same time, execute really well on that significant growth investments. And as a result, adjusted BPS in Q3 was a $1.30 higher than included in our prior guide. And the the components that's over achievement or a dollar from testing response revenue, $0.20 from the core business, and $0.10 from FX on the base business. Overall, another excellent quarter. Let me now provide some color on the Q3 performance. Beginning with our Q3 earnings results, as you saw on our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 2% to GAAP EPS in the quarter with $4.79 down 1% from Q3 last year. On the top-line our Q3, reported revenue grew 9% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue increased included 7% organic growth, a tailwind of 1% from foreign exchange, and 1% contribution from acquisitions.  As I mentioned, the base business organic growth in the quarter was 10%. Change by our performance by geography during the quarter, North America was flat. Europe grew over 20% Asia-Pacific grew low double-digits. China grew in the low single-digits and rest of the world decline in the high single-digits. The organic growth rate by geo are skewed by the response revenue in the current and prior quarters, as well as the scale of the impact of the pandemic on the base business in the prior year. Since our operational performance, Q3 adjusted operating income decreased 1% and adjusted operating margin was 29.8%, 310 basis points lower than Q3 last year. In the quarter, our PPI Business System enabled us to deliver strong productivity, which has more than offset by unfavorable business mix, and the ongoing strategic investments across that businesses.  Including investments in our colleagues, all of these are being made to support our near and long-term growth. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total Company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 51.4%, 90 basis points lower than Q3 last year. The decrease in gross margin had similar drivers to those I've just mentioned for adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 17.9% of revenue, an increase of 190 basis points versus Q3 of 2020. Total R&D expense was approximately $350 million representing growth of 19% versus Q3 2020. It reflects our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation to fuel future growth. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter and net interest expense with a $190 million $17 million lower than Q3 last year, largely due to lower average interest rate on our debt.  Adjusted other income expense with net income in the quarter of $9 million, $7 million pile in Q3 2020, mainly due to changes in non-operating effect. But the tax rate in the quarter was 14.2%. Down a 150 basis points versus Q3 last year due to the benefits of our tax planning initiatives. Average diluted shares were 397 million in Q3, 2 million lower year-over-year, driven by the share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet, cash flow performance enabled by our PPI Business System continued to be very strong. Year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $6.9 billion, up 38% from the same period last year. Year-to-date free cash flow was $5.2 billion, up 27% from the same period last year. And that's after investing $1.7 billion of net capital expenditure. This reflects the strong returns we're generating in the short-term and investments we're making for the long-term. We returned over $100 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This reflects some 18% dividend increase announced in February. And during the quarter we issued $3.1 billion in new debt as part of the prefinancing for the PPD acquisition. We ended Q3 with $12 billion in cash and $21.7 billion was the total debt. And leverage ratio at the end the quarter with 1.6 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 0.7 times on a Net debt basis. Concluding my comments on total Company performance adjusted ROIC was 22.3%, up 740 basis points from Q3 last year, as we continue to generate exceptional returns. Now provide some color on the performance for that full business segments. Similar to last quarter's, I'll start with some spring thoughts on the impact of COVID-19 response in that segments. From a revenue standpoint, as was the case in the past quarters, the majority of our COVID-19 response revenue was recognized in life sciences solutions. With the remainder recognizing the public products and services, especially diagnostics. From a margin standpoint, the impact of COVID-19 differed across the segments based on the scale of the response revenue, and the different levels of profitability on that revenue. In addition, during the quarter, we continue to make strategic investments across all of our businesses.  Besides, those investments does not necessarily align with the COVID-19 response revenue in these segments. That does skew some of the reported in the segment margin. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions, Q3 reported revenue in this segment increased 9%, an organic growth was 4%. In the quarter, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 48.9%, down 600 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw a positive volume leverage, which is more than offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. In the analytical instruments segment, reported revenue increased 11% in Q3, and organic growth with 9%.  Growth in the segment this quarter was driven by the electromicroscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income in analytical instruments increased 54%, and adjusted margin was 17.8%, up 500 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we delivered very strong volume pull-through and productivity, which is partially offset by the strategic investments we're making across those segments. In respect to the diagnostics in Q3, reported revenue decreased by 5% and the segment declined organically by 5%. In the quarter, we saw a strong growth in our immunodiagnostics, clinical diagnostics, and transplant diagnostic businesses, which was offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating income decreased 22% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 22.7%, down 520 basis points from the prior year. In Q3, in drug positive productivity enabled by our PPI Business System, this was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments in the quarter. Finally, in the [Indiscernible] products and services segment, Q3 reported revenue increased 12%, organic growth was 10%. In the quarter, we saw very strong growth in all of our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 8% and adjusted operating margin was 11%, which is 40 basis points lower than the prior year. In the quarter, we drove good volume pull-through, and productivity by our PPI Business System, which was more than offset by strategic investments. With that, let me now turn to our updated guidance. As Marc mentioned, we're increasing full-year guidance for both 2021 and 2021. For 2021, we're banking the Q3 beat and maintaining our prior guidance assumptions for Q4. Then for 2022, we're carrying over the base business and vaccines and therapies beat from Q3 '21 into the 2022 full-year numbers. This is enabling a strong beat and raise for both years reflecting the continued excellent strength of the business. I will now provide you with more detailed starting with 2021. In terms of revenue, we're raising our full-year 21 guidance by $1.2 billion to $37.1 billion, an d increasing our full-year organic growth outlook from 9% to 12%.  That includes an increase in the base business organic growth outlook for the full-year from 12% to 13% and an increase in the COVID-19 response revenue for the year from $6.7 billion to $7.7 billion, which represents $5.8 billion of testing response revenue, and $1.9 billion of vaccines and therapies response revenue. As I mentioned previously, there are no changes in the revenue assumptions in Q4 and our revised 2021 guidance. We're continuing the same de-risked approach to guidance for COVID-19 testing response revenue, and continue to assume $450 million of testing-related revenue in Q4. There continue to be a range of outcomes we're tapping in the fourth quarter and for 2022. There's scenarios where testing demand could be higher than that included in our guidance. Should that be the case, we will be well-positioned to support customer needs. And as we did in Q3, we will flow the benefits of that through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to continue to take a direct approach to the Outlook. And as a reminder, there are four fewer selling days in Q4 '21, compared to the same period last year. Incorporating our very strong Q3 performance into the revised '21 guidance, we now expect that adjusted operating margins for the full-year will be approximately 30.4%, 70 basis points higher than both our prior guide, and 2020.  Then same to the adjusted EPS, by banking the Q3 beat, we are raising our full-year '21 adjusted EPS guidance by $1.30 to $23.37, which would result in 20% growth over 2020. The revised guidance seems an adjusted income tax rate of 14.3% in 2021, slightly higher than the prior guide to reflect the marginal tax rate on our increased profitability. The rest of the assumptions underlying that 2021 guidance remains the same. And to call out a few of those, we've not included any operational benefit in 2021 for the acquisition of PPD, which is assumed to close at the end of the year.  We expect full-year net interest costs to be approximately $510 million. We're assuming net capital expenditures were approximately $2.5 to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion in 2021. Our guidance still includes $3.8 billion of capital deployment, which is $2 billion a share buybacks, $1.4 billion per completed M&A, and $400 million of the capital return to shareholders through dividends. Let me estimate the full-year average diluted share count will be 397 million shares. Now, moving on to the 2020 guidance rates. As I mentioned, we're carrying over the base business and vaccines and therapies peak from Q3 '21 into the 2022 full-year numbers.  In terms of revenue, we're raising our full-year 2022 guidance by $200 million to $40.5 billion. That reflects a $250 million increase in core revenue, offset positive by $50 million less FX tailwind for the year. The guidance for 2022 continues to see in core organic growth of 8% and $750 million of testing response revenue for the year. In terms of the adjusted EPS, we're raising our full-year 2022 guidance by $0.20 to $21.36. As Marc mentioned, the 2022 guidance increase reflects the increased strength of our core business, adding to the already very strong outlook for 2022. As I shared with you at the recent Investor Day. So to conclude, we're delivering another ex -- we delivered another excellent quarter and are in great position to achieve both our '21 and 2022 goals. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Rafael Tejada : Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Please stand by while we compile the Q& A roster. In order to allow everyone in queue an opportunity to address the Thermo Fisher management team, please limit your time on the call to one question and one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. Our first question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Marc maybe one for you just on the guidance. Obviously encouraging to see you raise the '22 guidance going to flow-through the beat so soon after providing at the Analyst Day. Can you just talk about not bumping the 4Q number? Obviously, again, the core seemed a bit stronger in 3Q, the end-market recovery seems well on its way. I certainly understand keeping the testing conservative. But maybe just on the core business, what kept you guys from flowing through a bit of that strength into 4Q? Marc Casper : Patrick, thanks for the question. Good morning. Obviously, really outstanding Q3. When I think about the momentum in the core business in the fourth quarter, we obviously enter the fourth quarter with very strong performance. As I look at the outlook for Q4, first, we felt it was prudent to keep it at the same that we did last quarter. There's nothing particularly deep about that. We have -- or less selling days. So when you look at the base business results, it's very similar. It implies about 9% growth, about 5% reported, and about 4 points for the day. You see here about 9% growth. So very similar to what you saw in Q3. And when you look at the other part of core, which is the vaccine and therapy numbers, similar levels of revenue to what you saw in Q3 there. So we felt that was a prudent view. On the testing response, we kept the de-risk number. We're obviously going to shift whatever our customers need and if you think about how short the true visibility is for testing response, which is we de-risk ed at the end of July. And by the time we got into August, the Delta variant had creating huge demand for testing. So we feel that the 450 number is one that we have incredibly high likelihood of achieving and we'll obviously shift, meaning it could work. And that other customers need it. So that's how we've thought about. And for -- as we talked about 2022, we carried forward the core revenue beat into the year. And as we sit here at the end of January, when we give our full year, our final guidance for the year we'll look at what is the right level of assumptions and make adjustments as appropriate. Patrick Donnelly : That's helpful. Makes sense. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on China. Low single-digit growth that you got a lot of noise in the region there between the tender process, general macro headlines. Can you just expand a bit on what you guys are seeing there? Again, it's always hard to remove a little bit of the comp noise and COVID noise. So would love just your thoughts on China and what you're expecting on the go forward. Marc Casper : I think given the way your offset by over their questions for us explains what's going on, which is we had low single-digit growth. In the year-ago period, we had an incredibly strong COVID response revenue in China. So that drives there. When I look at bookings which gives you a sense of new orders, that grew about 10% in the quarter. So that activity was good. We have a strong backlog there and reviewing what's going on with our local team. No. Conditions actually continue to be good and the government's focused on some of the initiatives that will drive strong long-term growth. Focus on Biotech industry and food safety, those kinds of things. So I think China ultimately continues to be a nice, strong growth market for the Company going forward. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thank you, Marc. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Tycho Peterson : Hey, good morning. Marc, first question on supply-chain. I don't think anybody can -- it's a huge risk for you guys. You obviously can handle these things well, but maybe just give us some color on what's going on in the ground, like are you able to pass on higher resin costs? Are there component shortages in do you have to work down inventory? Just curious on some of the gives and takes around supply chain for you that's right now. Marc Casper : Tycho, good morning and thanks for the question. Yes, so supply chain, as you step back and almost start a level above. Thermo Fisher, then get to Thermo Fisher. Now the world is clearly experiencing supply chain disruptions. And it really as the pandemic is unwinding, we're all seeing that and the duration and the impact of that still to be determined, all right? And as I think about our Company, it's really the scale of advantages we have and the incredibly strong execution capabilities we have because of our PPI Business System, it's a real competitive advantage.  All right, and we're well-positioned to navigate these environments better than the smaller or less capable companies. So that's how I think about it. As I think about Q3 there was no material impact in our results based on supply chain challenges. The areas that you see them, they're being managed with things like freight and logistics. Delivery times are a little bit slower. So you have things like that, that you have to manage through and electronic components, things of that sort.  And we're managing through those things effectively. And I have high confidence in our team's ability to navigate it in a very well -- in a very strong way. And I think we will be talking about this in some fashion across the world and across specifically [Indiscernible] in diagnostics, probably into 2022. Tycho Peterson : Okay, that's helpful. And then a follow up on PPD. Last quarter, you talked about the second request from the FTC, and then you cut every CMA developments. I know you reiterated the timelines to close by year-end, but can you maybe just update us on how that process is going and was the CMA development expected in your view? Marc Casper : Yes. Tycho, in terms of PPD, it's going well and on track, so we're largely complete with the U.S. FTC process and we -- there's no surprises on the remaining couple of filings, including working with the UK government. So those are all we anticipated when we announced the transaction. So that's all progressing well, and we feel confident our ability to have the opportunity to welcome our new colleagues during the fourth quarter to Thermo Fisher Scientific. Tycho Peterson : Okay. Thank you. Marc Casper : You're welcome. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Marc, [Indiscernible] give us an update on the durability of the investments that you've been making in testing. I want to stay conservative around the outlook for COVID, but just how are you feeling about the durability on the PCR side? Any updates you can provide around uptake at Mesa. And just a clarification. The M&A in the quarter, was that the contingent payment for Mesa? Stephen Williamson : Certainly M&A in the quarter. That's just continued revenue from Mesa. That business is performing well. Marc Casper : Yes. So in terms of the durability, embedded in our outlook, from a de-risked perspective for next year is $750 million of COVID testing related revenue, and we'll obviously refine that when we give our original we started, start the year and see what the world looks like. There's obviously certain aspects of our response on the testing side that will have some level of durability, but it's a relatively modest number compared to the billions of dollars of COVID-19, the PCR tests and sample prep that we provided. The areas that you would expect to have [Indiscernible] is going to be the increased installed base of QPCR instruments in sample prep instruments, which will get repurpose for other testing. We've obviously developed respiratory panels as well. So likely for the future you're going to see some level of people presenting with an upper respiratory infection and doctors will want to know whether it's COVID or flu or RSV. So you'll have some of that [Indiscernible]. And customer feedback on the Mesa Biotech technology. It's super positive. It's turned to a large customer, couple of days ago and they did a head-to-head versus some other technologies and basically said the users just love it and are excited about working on developing a broader menu overtime as well. So those are some of the things that will increase our share of business post COVID, or more endemic COVID phase. And that's business that we really didn't have pre -pandemic. So I think that's pretty cold, but relative to the billions of dollars of revenue it will be more modest number. Jack Meehan : Great. And then my second question is on Analytical instruments site, hate to nitpick small numbers as the compounded growth by my math step-down from like 4.5%, maybe 3% in the quarter. Just curious how the order book there is shaping up and can you give any color on what the guidance implies for the fourth quarter for that segment? Marc Casper : Yes. So Jack Kevin, you can nitpick anything you want. It's good to focus on the areas that aren't clear. So I actually want to step back and look at analytical instruments. Actually a very solid quarter, very strong performance in electron microscopy [indiscernible] expected very well. We're super excited about ASMS, which is just upon us and exciting product launches are highlighted a few of them on the call with the TSQ quadrupole mass spectrometer. When we updated all 3 on our new UHPLC system.  When you actually look and say you look at the details on the numbers, we saw softness in parts of chemical analysis, that's really what's in there. And you haven't seen the full recovery in some of the industrial end markets. You see great strength in things that are semiconductor materials, financial ladens that shows through across our businesses. But in some of the what I'll call historically core industry. You haven't seen a full recovery over the last couple of years. So that's what is kind of embedded in the numbers. Jack Meehan : Got it. Stephen, any color on 4Q for the segment? Stephen Williamson : Nice we've continued good performance at business and bookings growth strong in the quarter and outlook for Q4 and '22 look very positive. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Marc Casper : Thanks Jack. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Marc Casper : Hi Derik? Derik De Bruin : Hi, good morning. A couple of questions, so just taken a little bit follow up on Jack's question there. Any issues in shipping analytical instruments in the quarter and getting things installed means just getting into labs or logistics and remain around. I'm just wondering if 3Q is always a little bit with squarely quarter anyway, given seasonality. I just was wondering if the results with something compounded just in terms of not being able to ship some products, you get some things out the door, get some revenues recognized because of the current situations? Marc Casper : Nothing that jumps out at me is being significant, Derik. When I think about bookings were stronger and maybe shipping took a day or two longer or so, it could be some math in that but none of our teams talked about lab not ready shipping delays. No, nobody -- nobody used this is a discussion topic in our deeper reviews with the business. So is possibly, but nothing that jumped out as being material from that perspective. Bookings were strong, so I think that's -- that's encouraging for the upcoming few quarters. Derik De Bruin : Okay. And Marc, how are you thinking about wage inflation and -- and retention? And particularly this is relates to, as you think about PPD, I mean, obviously there's a big war for talent in the clinical research associate population, transitions between -- acquisitions of CRO's tend to create some volatility in terms of headcount. And I'm just thinking about you and your Biopharma services segment, how you're dealing with potential disruptions or trying to stem off some of the headwinds you could see there? Marc Casper : So when I think about our team, let's start with the Thermo Fisher Scientific team and make a brief comment about PPD. We have a terrific team. They have delivered these spectacular results for year-in-year-out, quarter-on-quarter out, including in very trying times of the pandemic and they make a difference. And we have done a really -- we've been really focused on ensuring that this is the best place to work. And we we've rewarded our teams. We talked last quarter about some of the additional compensation actions we've taken. We continue to do that. Recognize the strong performance.  We've invested in our facilities, training, we are recognized for world-class development training. It's just things that we continue to focus on. And that really has allowed us to have very, very strong retention of our teams. PPD is a very well-run business with a great leadership team that's navigating the environment while the business is performing very well.  There is no disruption to the integration. We're literally is lifting it as it is and running it as it is going forward. And over time, we're going to come up with some great new solutions that'll make a difference for customers, but this is a growth-oriented, customer-oriented, patients-benefit acquisition. The feedback that the PPD team that's getting on their colleagues is super positive and super excited and we're looking forward to the transition to our Company on the -- in the Fourth Quarter. Derik De Bruin : If I can squeeze one more in on China. How much of your portfolio is manufactured in China that would not be subjected to the buy -- or would be the sort of -- would be part of the buy-local sort of like push there. Just some idea on your manufacturing footprint there, and what we consider as being outside versus inside China? Marc Casper : We have very scale manufacturing facilities in China for China. And we also import a number of products into the market. And the way you can almost think about it is, if there is no local alternative for the products, you often see them imported into the country. If there is local alternatives, they often come from either our Chinese operations or other low cost regions around the world.  That's the way to think about. It's a 100% accurate as I'm sure there's some things that have low for competition that could shift into the country, but that's the strategy at a high level and that is the [Indiscernible]. We're well-positioned to support our Chinese customers. And in areas where the Chinese customers really want high degree of supply chain assuredness, things like single-use technologies. We built a very scale facility in Suzhou to be able to meet those needs. Derik De Bruin : Thank you. Marc Casper : You're welcome. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Stifel. Dan Arias : Morning, guys. Thanks for the questions. Marc, 2 questions for you, 1 on BioPharma and 1 on [indiscernible] if I can, On BioPharma, I'm just curious what your expected for flash spending at the end of the year here. Obviously, plenty of nuances in that segment. So do you feel like it's more or less likely to be just sort of similar to what we've seen in non-pandemic years? Marc Casper : Yes.So Dan, good morning. In terms of pharma biotech, business performed really well. In terms of the growth that we are delivering with a 20% -- better than 20% growth in the quarter. What we're assuming -- this is the convention we use every year. We're assuming an average year-end spend across our customer base and we really don't get visibility until right after the thanksgiving holiday. So we use that convention and that's served us well. I think most years has been average or above average. There's 1 year that it was below average from our collection over the last number. That's how we think about it. Dan Arias : And then maybe on the NIH funding dynamic, which you've usually got a pretty decent line of sight into. As we head into next year, I'm just curious if you have a view on the budget and the way that it looks like it might be allocated just given that you have that core budget and that RPA age component, are you hearing anything about the RPA age funding and whether it would sort of just be accessible on the basic researchers. I mean, I don't want -- I don't feel -- I don't want to come out of left field with that one if that's what sounds like but it seems like that is a question in the academic world, and there really aren't too many people to ask about that so I'd figured, I'd throw it out there. Marc Casper : So, Dan, it's not clear yet and I think that ARFA (ph) age concept is a really important concept for the U.S., right? The way to think about it is you have defense spending, right? And defense spending prepares for all of the what could happen [Indiscernible] invest in different technologies to defend the country [Indiscernible] -H is the healthcare equivalent. It's investments and things to anticipate future challenges, as opposed to typically our researchers solving clearly known challenges that you have now.  And so I think that the fact that we're going to longer-term funding that will prepare for the next pandemic or other future challenges. I think it's fantastic and will spurt great research. How that exactly it's going to be allocated, I haven't seen any available come out, but I haven't seen the details of how that's going to be done, and I know that the U.S. is not the only country that's talking about using vehicles like this. So I think this is one of the reasons that we're so excited about what the Scientific funding is going to be like going forward in our industry and we're incredibly well-positioned to serve that. Dan Arias : Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks, Marc. Marc Casper : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar for Evercore. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys, congrats on a nice [Indiscernible] and thanks for taking my question. Marc, maybe one on fiscal [Indiscernible] guidance rates here by a couple of 100 million, looks like the base came up by 250. I'm curious where the strength is coming from. Would you say that's coming from BioPharma across-the-board? Or what is driving that base improvement? Marc Casper : So, Vijay, good morning. Thanks for the question. As I thought about the 2022, we obviously saw strength across our Company in Q3 and -- in the core and we flowed that entirely into the next year. And obviously, very strong performance in pharmabiotech, so that's very encouraging and it is obviously a large driver of that, but we saw, we could -- still could perform actually across the different parts of our business. So I don't want to say it reflects the portfolio of activities that we have is the way you think about the strength with core. Vijay Kumar : And then just, I think to clarify that more, in the base now includes vaccine contribution, but this is -- I guess what you're saying is this across the board. This is not just vaccine outlook improvement, correct? Stephen Williamson : Just to clarify, so [Indiscernible] within the guidance rate for next year, it's basically up $250 million, which includes 190 from the base plus $60 million more vaccine therapies. The combination of all of that is 250 for the core and then slightly decreased because of FX, less tailwind. The strength of the base business and back-end therapy that's being carried forward into '22. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Steve, and then just one quick one on -- on the tax side. How should we think about any potential tax reform changes in impact to Thermo? Marc Casper : So the guidance we've given here, it doesn't assume any significant U.S tax reform or other tax reform across the world. And we continue to monitor the changing dynamics closely in DC and advocate for changing needs to happen with the right change happens with -- with but have unintended consequences for the aggression. Revenue raise is being paid for but let's make sure if that's being done in a logical way. Company have a competitive advantage in that tax position versus other well-run companies and we expect that competitive advantage to be continued forward through whatever changes potentially can happen. So that's the best way to think about tax for the Company. Vijay Kumar : Thank you, guys. Marc Casper : Thanks, Vijay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of [Indiscernible] Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks for -- Thanks for taking the question, Marc. It's hard to find anything positive to shout out for the adjusted basis point. So the first question is just on bio -- is on bioproduction. So maybe I missed it in the prepared remarks. Can you just discuss what the base growth did this quarter. So x the COVID contribution and kind of what's implied in 4Q and 22 and any color on trends there. Marc Casper : Yeah. So Dan, thanks for the question. And in terms of the [Indiscernible] is painful for sure. In terms of bioproduction, exactly the opposite of that which is things that are extremely robust and doing very well. So when I think about the -- I'll give it at this the Biotech and pharmaceutical level. With a little bit over 20% growth in the quarter, you had a $510 million of vaccine and therapy revenue. We saw very strong growth, excluding the contribution from vaccines and therapies as well. When you look to the Outlook, while we don't guide obviously by segment, we would expect that from a Biotech that continues to be very strong and we're expecting a meaningful level of growth coming from that in 2022 as well. The end-market looks very robust. Scientific discoveries are very strong. Customer demand is good, and we're seeing strong interest in our clinical trials. Packaging and logistics capabilities, that bodes well. Especially, the cycle is very good and we're well-positioned to capitalize on.  I think one of the things that maybe investors don't have a 100% understanding of, if you think about what the Company looks like upon close of PPD, we have about $20 billion of revenue serving pharmaceutical and biotech. But half of that is actually serving production. And when you think about that, that's the largest position serving the production market by far. And we obviously have very attractive positions in serving both clinical trials and the research activities as well. So we're well-positioned to deliver great growth into the future. Dan Brennan : Great thank you for that and then maybe just a high-level follow-up on at the Analyst Day. Obviously, the 7% - 9% growth outlook was stronger than expected. And I know at the time you discussed execution in LPN markets to support that outlook. We certainly feel the question from investors regarding Thermo typically has set a reasonably conservative bar and executed well against that. So just -- maybe just wondering is 7 - 9%, should we think about that similarly having any conservative advice and so can you help us think through any of the drivers or details of that guidance? Thanks Marc. Marc Casper : You made me smile, which is good. We haven't even gotten into the period yet, which we'll get there right in terms, we're still working on 2021 right now. But when I think about the philosophy around the 7 to 9 is the exact same philosophy that we had when we had the continued increase in growth over time at the Company. Which is you sign up for targets when you are able to do and you demonstrated you're delivering it and you have confidence in your ability to do that. And we have great confidence in our ability to deliver the 7% to 9% growth.  We're not going to cap ourselves at the 7 to 9, right? So we're going to focus on delivering as much as we can and deliver great performance. And we'll look at the strength of our end-markets and what's our share gains look like and set the appropriate annual targets. But we felt that 7 to 9 was an appropriate number. One that we have a high degree of confidence in the ability to deliver and with the goal to work to the biggest possible number we can overtime. Dan Brennan : Thank you. Marc Casper : Welcome, Dan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of Leerink. Puneet Souda : Thanks, Marc. Thanks for taking the question. First one, just a clarification. I know 5 to 11 year - olds vaccinations were voted positively by the panel yesterday. So just wondering if that's already contemplated into this guidance. I know that was a little bit later in the day, so likely not, but I just wanted to confirm. And also on the boosters what I wanted to confirm if that is also contemplated in the fourth quarter and increased for vaccines in 2022. Marc Casper : So, Puneet, when I think about how we've done our outlook on vaccine and therapy, it really is based on dialogue with our customers and orders that they have given us. Some of -- some 100% on work, and some are going to say we are going to give you the work on the paperwork and some of it is in the orders. So it's less about children or boosters are those things and actually what our customer you are saying, the activity that they want. But obviously things like vaccine mandates and booster shots and children adds to the durability of the demand for vaccines and therapies. We're largely operating with our capacity so you don't get short-term swings in the volumes based on new pronouncements or you get them over time. So that's how we thought about it. Puneet Souda : Great. Thanks. And the last question for me, is this some capacity expansion. Could you provide a view into the need for further capacity expansion in bioproduction at this point? You open the Switzerland site for biologics production, larger vessels, pipette tube production as well that's coming onboard, Keep facility expansions that have happened. So overall just wondering what you're hearing from the biotherapeutics customers overall. And from the C-suites there, in terms of the demand and your need to further expanded capacity at this point in the cycle of post-COVID. Marc Casper : In general, Puneet, we have, in-flight. The activities that we need to meet the anticipated demand. Obviously, we're going to complete a lot of these projects during the course of 2022. A little bit goes into 2023. But it's largely what we have started already. If there are specific opportunities that are part of our longer-term roadmap that makes a difference. You may see us evaluate them, but there's not a long list of those. We've been very aggressive to position ourselves to meet our customers future needs. And the commitments we've gotten and that puts us in a great spot. So, that's how we thought about. So let me -- Puneet Souda : Great thank you. Marc Casper : Wrap it up here and I want to thank everybody for participating and with a strong nine months behind us, we're in a great position to achieve another excellent year. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific and we look forward to updating you early in 2022. Thanks everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call and a wrap-up of a truly exceptional year for Thermo Fisher Scientific. We delivered another quarter of very strong results. And as I reflect on the year, three things stand out to me. Our proven growth strategy powered by our PPI Business System continues to drive outstanding financial performance. Customer demand is strong. Our core business is performing very well, we're gaining market share and we continue to play a leading role in the societal response to COVID-19. And finally, we continue to build on our trusted partner status with our customers. All of this gives me great confidence in a very bright future as we continue to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. I'll get into more detail in my remarks later, but first, let me recap the financials. Starting with the quarter, our revenue was $10.7 billion. Adjusted operating income was $3.16 billion. And our adjusted operating margin was 29.5%. Adjusted EPS was $6.54 per share. Turning to our results for the full year, we grew revenue by 22% to $39.21 billion in 2021. Adjusted operating income increased 27% to $12.14 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 130 basis points to 31%. And we delivered a 28% increase in adjusted EPS to $25.13 per share. Building on the tremendous success that we had in 2020, I'm incredibly proud of our team's stellar performance in 2021. It's really a testament to the strength of our global team and our proven growth strategy, resulting in another year of exceptional financial results and share gain. Let me now give you a color on the results for the quarter and the year, starting with pharma and biotech. We had outstanding performance delivering growth over 20% in the fourth quarter and over 25% for the full year. In addition to strong market dynamics, these results were driven by a unique customer value proposition and our leading goal in supporting our customers across a wide range of exciting therapeutic areas, including our role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. During the year, we saw broad-based strength across our businesses in this end market, including our bioproduction, pharma services, biosciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses as well as in the research and safety market channel. In academic and government, we declined in the low single-digits during in the quarter against strong demand in the year-ago period and grew in the low double digits for the full year. During the year, we saw very good growth across a range of our businesses, particularly biosciences, electron microscopy and our research and safety market channel. Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the low teens during the quarter, and we grew in the high teens for the full year. During the year, we saw strong growth in our electron microscopy, and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses as well as in the research and safety market channel. Finally, in diagnostics and health care, Q4 revenue was 30% lower than the prior year quarter, and revenue grew in the high single digits for the full year. Throughout the year the team executed really well to support customers' testing needs. And in the base business, we had strong growth in our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. Before I move to our growth strategy, let me provide a few comments on our role in the pandemic response. In the quarter, we generated $2.45 billion in COVID-19 response related revenue. This was driven by the emergence of the Omicron variant, which led to strong testing demand as well as our significant role in enabling vaccine and therapy production. Throughout 2021, we continue to operate with speed at scale to meet our customers' needs related to COVID-19 and generated total response revenue of over $9 billion, of which $2 billion were from vaccines and therapies. I'm very proud of the role that we continue to play around the world to enable our customers and governments to fight the pandemic. At the same time, we're executing our core business strategy incredibly well. Let me provide an update on the progress we made in 2021, executing our proven growth strategy, which consists of three elements, as you know, developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in the high-growth and emerging markets, and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. We made outstanding progress in 2021. Let me share a few of the highlights. Starting with the first pillar. It was a fantastic year of high-impact innovation. In 2021, we launched a number of new products across our businesses, strengthening our industry leadership and enabling our customers to advance their important work. In our bioproduction business, we launched a high-performer DynaDrive single-use bioreactor. Available in sizes up to 5,000 liters, this latest advancement in our DynaDrive single-use bioreactor technology brings the benefits of single-use technologies to unprecedented volumes and performance and ensures consistent scalability from pilot scale studies through commercial production. In chromatography and mass spectrometry, we continue to innovate across life sciences research and biopharmaceutical development. During the year, we extended the impact of our industry-leading Orbitrap platform to bring high-resolution analysis to a range of applications, including toxicology and metabolomics. And during the fourth quarter, we launched the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Exploris MX mass detector, providing high-throughput analysis to improve the development and production of biopharmaceutical. In electron microscopy, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Helios 5EXL wafer dual beam scanning electron microscope to support the development of increasingly smaller and more complex semiconductors. And in genetic sciences, our new Applied Biosystems' QuantStudio 7 Pro Dx real-time PCR system, launched in Q4, enables clinical testing laboratories to accelerate molecular diagnostics. The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in the high-growth emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers. We continue to strengthen our capabilities serving these markets, and I'll highlight a few examples. To increase our capacity for single-use technology, we opened new manufacturing sites in China and Singapore to serve both local and global demand from biopharma customers. In South Korea, we continue to enhance our own capabilities with customer-focused innovation centers for both the semiconductor industry and our biopharma customers. These additional capabilities position us really well to support our customers' needs. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our unique customer value proposition. We've continued to significantly accelerate organic investments in our capabilities and added capacity to be an even better partner for our customers. In 2021, we invested $2.5 billion in capital to meet short- and long-term customer demand. Highlights included expansion of our sterile fill/finish network, bioproduction, enzymes, nucleotide, plasmids and lab products capacity. As always, our PPI Business System and our mission-driven culture were major factors in our success during the year. They enable the rapid execution of our capital investments and help us find a better way every day so we can continue to bring innovative new solutions to our customers, work more efficiently and effectively, and operate with speed at scale to create even greater value for all of our stakeholders. Turning to capital deployment, we were very active again this year, which further strengthened our customer value proposition. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In 2021, we were very active, investing $24 billion in M&A and completing ten transactions to further strengthen our customer value proposition. This was highlighted by the addition of PPD, which we closed in December. We're super excited to have our PPD colleagues as part of the company and share their expertise as we work together to enhance innovation and productivity for our pharma and biotech customers. PPD is performing at a very high level. The business delivered great results in 2021 and is entering 2022 with outstanding momentum, significantly ahead of our original expectations at the time of the deal announcement. The customer feedback has been extremely positive and we're excited about the pipeline of opportunities that we're building. We're executing our proven integration methodology, which is a key element of our PPI Business System to create value for all of our stakeholders. We're well positioned to deliver year three cost synergies of $75 million and $50 million in operating income from revenue synergies. And we're on track to deliver $40 million in cost synergies in 2022. At the end of the year, we completed the acquisition of PeproTech, a leading provider of recombinant proteins, which is an excellent complement to our industry-leading biosciences business. In 2021, we also returned $2.4 billion of capital to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. Turning to a brief update on the progress of our ESG priorities, I'm very proud that over the past year we significantly advanced our environmental, social and governance initiatives. Our mission, to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer has never been more relevant. Highlights this year include our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This builds on our earlier goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% across our operations by 2030. Enhancing the reporting and transparency through our expanded corporate social responsibility report and alignment of multiple ESG reporting frameworks. And we're actively engaging with our community. Our Foundation for Science reached more than 100,000 students globally through our STEM education programs. Our goal is to make a very positive impact in the communities in which we live and work. With that, I'd like to now review our 2022 guidance at a high level, and then Stephen will take you through the details. We're significantly raising both our revenue and earnings guidance. This increase is a result of both the strong performance of our core business and an increase in the assumption for COVID-19 testing-related revenue. We're raising our 2022 full year revenue guidance by $1.5 billion to $42 billion, which would result in 7% revenue growth over 2021. And we're increasing our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $1.07 to $22.43 per share. So to summarize our key takeaways from 2021; we executed very well to continue our growth momentum and deliver outstanding financial performance. Our business is performing very well, and we're gaining market share. Our exceptional performance in 2021 and momentum entering 2022, enabled us to raise our outlook for 2022, and we're incredibly well positioned for the future. Our proven growth strategy positions us to deliver long-term core organic revenue growth of 7% to 9%. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, in Q4, we delivered an excellent quarter, capping off another outstanding year. For the full year 2021, we delivered 17% organic growth that included 14% organic base business growth and $9.2 billion of COVID-19 response revenue. We delivered 28% growth in adjusted earnings per share in 2021 and over $7 billion of free cash flow, all while significantly investing in our company to enable a really bright future. I'm very proud of what the team accomplished this year. These results are significantly ahead of our prior guidance. So let me walk you through the key elements of the beat. We delivered $2.1 billion more revenue than included in our prior guide. This included $1.5 billion higher COVID-19 response revenue, $375 million of revenue from the PPD acquisition and $200 million higher base business revenue. On our last earnings call, we derisked testing response revenue in our guidance. And we said that if for any additional opportunities to support customers' testing needs, we'll be ready to do so and flow the benefits through our P&L, and that's exactly what we did in Q4. Let me turn to the base business. In Q4, we delivered 8% base business organic growth, which was 3 percentage points higher than assumed in the prior guide. This is very good performance, particularly given the four fewer selling days in the quarter. So excellent momentum on the top line. Our core business is on a great growth trajectory, and we continue to step up and meet our customers' testing needs. Our PPI Business System enabled us to generate great pull-through on the very strong revenue performance in Q4, leading to excellent adjusted EPS performance. We delivered $6.54 of adjusted EPS in the quarter and $25.13 for the full year; this was $1.76 ahead of our prior guide. So a broad-based beat to round out an outstanding year. Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance. Beginning with our earnings results, and as I mentioned we delivered $6.54 of adjusted EPS in the quarter. And for the full year, adjusted EPS was $25.13, up 28% compared to last year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.17. And for the full year 2021, GAAP EPS was $19.46, up 22% versus the prior year. On the top line, our Q4 reported revenue grew 1% year-over-year. The components of our Q4 revenue increase included a 4% organic revenue decrease, a 6% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 1% from foreign exchange. And as I mentioned, the base business organic revenue growth in the quarter was 8%. For the full year 2021, reported revenue increased 22%, this includes 17% organic growth, a 3% contribution from acquisitions and a 2% tailwind from foreign exchange. The full year base business organic growth was 14%. And in 2021, we delivered $9.23 billion of COVID-19 response revenue, which includes $2 billion of vaccines and therapy support revenue. Turning to our performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the response revenue in the current and prior year as well as four fewer selling days in Q4 2021 versus the prior year quarter. For Q4, North America declined in the low teens. Europe grew high single digits. Asia Pacific and China grew in the high single digits. And rest of the world grew mid-single digits. For the full year, North America grew low double digits. Europe grew over 25%. Asia Pacific grew over 20%, including just under 20% growth in China. And rest of the world grew mid-teens. Turning to our operational performance. Q4 adjusted operating income decreased 10% and adjusted operating margin was 29.5%, 380 basis points lower than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 27% and adjusted operating margin was 31%, which is 130 basis points higher than 2020. In the quarter, our PPI Business System enables to deliver strong volume leverage on the base business, and strong productivity. This was more than offset by the impact of lower testing response revenue and our ongoing strategic investments across our business to support our near- and long-term growth. For the full year, we drove positive volume leverage and productivity. We also had favorable business mix. This was partially offset by our strategic investments. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total Company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 50.5%, 340 basis points lower than Q4 last year. And for the full year, adjusted gross margin was 51.6%, up 40 basis points versus the prior year. For both the fourth quarter and full year, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 17.3% of revenue. And for the full year, adjusted SG&A was 17.1% of revenue, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to 2020. Total R&D expense was approximately $390 million in Q4. And for the full year, R&D expense was $1.4 billion, representing growth of 19% over the prior year, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation to fuel future growth. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter and net interest expense was $150 million, $16 million higher than Q4 last year, largely due to the PPD financing activities? Net interest expense for the full year was $493 million, an increase of $5 million from 2020. Adjusted other income and expense was a net income in the quarter of $7 million, $8 million higher than Q4 2020, mainly due to changes in non-operating FX. For the full year, adjusted other income and expense was a net income of $38 million, which is $8 million lower than the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.8%. This was 220 basis points lower than Q4 last year, mainly due to the different levels of pretax profitability year-over-year. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 14.6% or 30 basis points higher than 2020. Average diluted shares were 398 million in Q4, approximately 2 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution. And for the full year, the average diluted shares were 397 million. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow was another great highlight for the year. Cash flow from operating activities in 2021 was $9.5 billion, up 15% over the prior year. And free cash flow for the year was $7 billion after investing $2.5 billion of net capital expenditure. This reflects strong returns we're generating in the short-term and the investments that we'll make for the long-term. During the year, we returned approximately $2.4 million of capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends and we ended Q4 with $4.5 billion in cash. Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $34.9 billion, up $13.2 billion sequentially from Q3, largely as a result of the financing activities related to the PPD acquisition. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.7 times gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and 2.3 times on a net debt basis. And concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 19.8%, up 180 basis points from Q4 last year as we continue to generate exceptional returns. So I'll now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments, and let me start with a few framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 response revenue varies by segments that has been consistent throughout the year. We continue to make strategic investments across all of our businesses. The size of those investments does not necessarily align with the response revenue in each segment that does skew some of the reported segment margins. And during Q4, we had four fewer selling days than the year-ago quarter. And finally, we recently renamed Laboratory Products segment to reflect the inclusion of the PPD acquisition. It's now Laboratory Products in Biopharma Services segment. And also going forward, we'll refer to PPD as our clinical research business within this segment. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q4 reported revenue in the segment decreased 5% and organic revenue was 8% lower than the prior year quarter. In the quarter, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. This was offset by lower revenue in the genetic sciences business driven by lower testing revenue versus the year-ago quarter For the full year, reported revenue in the segment increased 28% and organic revenue increased 23%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 14%, and adjusted operating margin was 48.2%, down 490 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. And for the full year, adjusted operating income increased 28% and adjusted operating margin was 50%, a decrease of 20 basis points versus 2020. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 5% in Q4 and organic growth was 6%. Growth in this segment this quarter was driven by electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. For the full year, reported revenue in this segment increased 18% and organic revenue increased 17%. Q4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 15% and adjusted operating margin was 22.1%, up 190 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we saw favorable business mix and delivered strong volume pull-through and productivity enabled by our PPI Business System. That was partially offset by the strategic investments we're making across this segment. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 48% and adjusted operating margin was 19.7%, an increase of 390 basis points versus 2020. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q4, reported revenue and organic revenue were both 26% lower than the year-ago quarter. In the quarter, we saw a strong growth in our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses, which was offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year-ago quarter. For the full year, reported revenue in this segment increased 6% and organic revenue increased 5%. Q4 adjusted operating income decreased 43% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 20.5%, down 590 basis points from the prior year. In Q4, we drove positive productivity enabled by our PPI Business System. This is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments in the segment. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 6% and adjusted operating margin was 22.6%, a decrease of 300 basis points versus 2020. Then finally, Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. In Q4, reported revenue in this segment increased 16% and organic revenue growth was 5%. During Q4, we saw strong growth in the Pharma Services and Laboratory Products businesses and we recognized $375 million of revenue for PPD to clinical research business. For the full year, reported revenue in this segment increased 21% and organic revenue increased 15%. Q4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 42% and adjusted operating margin was 11.5%, which is 210 basis points higher than the prior year. In the quarter, we drove strong productivity by our PPI Business System and saw a favorable business mix, partially offset by strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 45%, and adjusted operating margin was 12.4%, an increase of 200 basis points versus 2020. Let me now turn to our updated 2022 guidance. Before I get into the details, I'd like to begin with a quick reminder about our definition of core business, which we introduced at our Investor Day last year and notably transitioned to it in 2022. Core includes our base business, the vaccines and therapies response revenue and the PPD acquisition. Given the scale of the PPD acquisition, our core organic growth calculation will include PPD on a full year basis, if we think that gives you the best view of how to look at the total company business and how it's performing. For full transparency, we'll also continue to provide total company organic growth when reporting our actual performance in 2022. So moving on to our guidance, as Marc mentioned we're significantly increasing our full year 2022 revenue and adjusted EPS outlook. We're raising our full year 2022 revenue guidance by $1.5 billion to $42 billion, and we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance by $1.07 to $22.43. This very strong raise reflects the excellent strength of the business and we continue to expect 8% core organic revenue growth in 2022. Let me now provide you with additional details on the updated guidance. Starting with revenue, where there are four elements driving the $1.5 billion raise. A $1 billion increase in the COVID-19 testing assumption, a $900 million increase for the core business, a $500 million decrease due to the change in FX rates, and $100 million increase to reflect the PeproTech acquisition, which closed just before the year-end. In terms of our COVID-19 testing revenue assumption, we're continuing the same derisked approach to guidance under a range of outcomes for the year. Our guidance now assumes $1.75 billion of testing revenue in 2022. There are scenarios where testing demand could be higher than this level and should that be the case, we're well positioned to support customer needs. And as we did in 2021, we'll flow the benefits of that through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to continue to take a derisked approach to the outlook. In terms of the core revenue raise, $600 million relates to PPD and reflects the excellent strength of that business and to a lesser extent the recent GAAP changes around deferred revenue measurement for acquisitions. We now expect PPD, our new clinical research business to deliver $6.5 billion in revenue in full year 2022. This represents 8% organic growth on a full year basis on top of 30% growth it delivered in 2021. And the remaining $300 million of the core revenue raise is to reflect the strong finish to 2021 by the rest of the core business. Our core business is in great shape. It ended 2021 with even more scale and as I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect that it will grow 8% organically in 2022. So a very strong raise overall for our revenue guidance. And we will use our PPI Business System to generate strong pull-through on that revenue. And we now expect adjusted operating margin to be 25.4% in 2022, that's a 20 basis points higher than what we assumed in our prior guidance. In terms of adjusted EPS. Our stronger business outlook is enabling us to raise the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance from $21.36 to $22.43, further building on an already very strong outlook for the year. Let me now provide you with a couple of other details on the 2022 guidance to help you with your models. As I mentioned PPD is expected to deliver $6.5 billion of revenue and $1 billion of adjusted operating income in 2022. This acquisition is now expected to contribute $1.90 to adjusted EPS in the year. PeproTech is expected to deliver revenue of just over $100 million in 2022 and $0.05 of adjusted EPS. FX is now expected to be a year-over-year headwind of $500 million in revenue or 1.3% and $0.31 from adjusted EPS. We continue to assume an adjusted income tax rate of 13% in 2022. We now expect full year net interest cost to be approximately $490 million and other income to be $10 million. We continue to assume net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion. Our guidance still assumes $2.5 billion of capital deployment, which is $2 billion of share buybacks to be already completed in January and $475 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. We now estimate that the full year average diluted share count will be between 395 million and 396 million shares. And finally, a couple of comments on phasing to help you with your modeling. In terms of revenue dollars, the assumption in the guide is the revenue dollars are fairly linear for the year, with Q1 and Q4 being slightly higher than Q2 and Q3. The derisked assumption for COVID-19 testing used in this guidance assumes that this revenue is very front-end loaded in the first half of the year, and then as an assumed endemic run rate level of $100 million of revenue per quarter in the second half of the year. Organic growth of the core business is expected to be fairly consistent throughout the year. And then in terms of adjusted EPS phasing, this guidance assumes slightly more weighting towards the first half of the year than the phasing we had last year, with Q1 being about the same percentage of the full year as we had in 2021. To conclude, we delivered another outstanding year, and we're in great position to achieve our 2022 goals. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Rafael Tejada : Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We take our first question from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Jack, please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Thank you and good morning. Marc Casper : Good morning, Jack. Jack Meehan : Wanted to start with PPD and the higher \u2013 good morning, Marc. Wanted to start with PPD and the higher 2022 growth trajectory here. Can you provide some more color around just your confidence in the handoff from the COVID-related work last year to other projects? PPD has been one of the leaders in biotech. So was curious to get your thought if some of that confidence is driven by some of the large Phase 3 mRNA studies, which are getting kicked off? Marc Casper : So Jack thanks for the question. Our clinical research business, PPD has really had a really excellent 2021 with 30% growth. And it was broad-based strength across biotech, biopharma, all the very important therapy areas that they're focused on, including work in the support of COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. As we look at the authorizations, we're very strong last year, which gives the business great momentum coming into 2022 and 2023. And we feel good to be able to grow that business in line with our core average of about 8% this year. So we feel very good about the outlook for the business. Jack Meehan : Great. And then for both you and Stephen, a big area of focus has been inflation in the market. So was wondering what your assumption is for pricing for 2022? Where you able to capture that across the portfolio? And how is that translating to revenue and earnings growth for the year? Stephen Williamson : Yes. So Jack, so we have been very active on using the pricing lever as part of our PPI Business System, and we have a great team that helps our businesses do that in a very appropriate way. And we've seen basically in the second half of 2021, and as we project forward to 2022, pricing around about 2 times the normal level given the inflationary environment we're facing. So that's in aggregate across the whole portfolio. It's different by different areas of the business, but that's the aggregate result, and we're offsetting the impact of inflation through that pricing activity. Jack Meehan : Thank you, guys. Marc Casper : Thanks Jack. Operator : We take our next question from Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks for taking the question guys. Marc, maybe just on the guidance raise, that core $400 million raise or so. Can you just talk through; I guess the end markets that you're seeing where you're feeling incrementally better going into 2022 versus a few months ago at the Analyst Day and then obviously, the 3Q update as well? Just kind of curious the confidence level going into 2022, you guys obviously sound quite bullish for the year. But maybe if you can just talk through some of the upside levers as we go into this year? Marc Casper : Yes. So Patrick, we really ended the year with really strong performance. And you see that in the 17% organic growth that we delivered for the full year. You see that in the very strong base business growth of 14%. And bookings in the fourth quarter was once again ahead of revenue. So we enter the year with very strong momentum. As we thought about the outlook for the year, obviously we were quite bullish with the 8% back in September with the Analyst Day. And the way that we thought about it was all of the additional revenue in the core; we're basically going to grow that. We're going to keep that and then grow that by 8% as well. And that's sort of what's implied in the guidance. So we feel very well positioned given what our outlook was in September, how the business finished the fourth quarter, the strength of the bookings, and therefore, 2022 should be another quite year for the company. Stephen Williamson : Yes. And Patrick, that \u2013 the extra \u2013 days was pretty broad across the business when I think about the impact in Q4. Patrick Donnelly : Understood. Okay. And then maybe just one on the capital deployment side. Obviously, you guys have been very active, another $2 billion to start the year here on the share repo. You kind of talked about the $7 billion free cash flow for the year. Can you just talk about the pipeline of opportunities on the deal side? Again, PeproTech seems like a nice fit. How active we should expect you to be, again, leverage seasonable at 2.3 coming out. So maybe just talk about the pipeline and the expectations for the year there? Marc Casper : Yes. So if you reflect back on last year, right, very active year with 10 transactions, and the bolt-ons about $4 billion worth of transactions, $20 billion roughly for PPD. So actually a really nice year of bolt-on activity. And if this was any other quarter in the fourth quarter, we actually were talking about PeproTech quite a bit, right, in terms of classic bolt-on, great growth prospects, good technology that is already performing well and will flourish under our ownership and the strength of our Biosciences business. So that's kind of the look back, right? And it gives you a sense that there's plenty of opportunity. Our pipeline is busy, right? We have plenty of financial capacity. We'll be incredibly disciplined to make sure that it fits our strict criteria, it creates shareholder value and that it really is additive to the portfolio. But we're actively looking at a number of transactions, and we'll see how they play out. The return of capital is also an important part of our strategy. And as you noted, we deployed already $2 billion on buybacks in the beginning of the year and we're excited to be able to do that for our shareholders as well. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks Marc. Marc Casper : You are welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Arias from Stifel. Dan, please go ahead. Dan Arias : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Marc, maybe just following up on Patrick's M&A question there. I'm just curious about whether or not you're actually seeing assets become more attractive these days given the market moves? I mean, we've all seen valuations in the public markets come in. So it feels tempting to say, yes, but I imagine that the management teams of these companies remember their stocks being a lot higher, not too long ago. And on the private side maybe sort of a similar thing relative to the last raise or something. So I guess the question is, are assets any more approachable than they used to be in reality or not really? Marc Casper : Yes. I think it's early to see that that changes increases the pool, if you will of potential actionable transactions, right? And because it takes a while for valuation expectations to really settle down. And obviously, the stock market has bounced around a bunch. So it's \u2013 I think it will take a while for expectations to change. Our pipeline is busy, right? And we are truly disciplined. And you've heard me say in the past, right, when valuations are more elevated, you're going to think about businesses that have a very favorable risk reward profile. So you don't have scenarios where the businesses that you acquire aren't creating shareholder value. And obviously, if you get in a period where valuations are more favorable from an M&A perspective, then that's going to open up the pool, right? But I don't think that happens in the first month or two of the year. I think it's more of a, we'll see how the year plays out. Dan Arias : Yes. Okay. That makes sense. And then maybe on the clinical channel, how would you describe the spending environment in the hospital landscape right now when it just comes to sort of non-COVID-related items as we start off the year? It seems like things were normalizing, but then we did get some hospital capacity constraints as Omicron surged. So just curious how you're seeing things trend and how spending priorities are looking in demand overall in the clinical segment? Marc Casper : Yes. So when I think about the core health care and diagnostics portion of the business, I look back at last year, we had solid growth in the \u2013 in that routine activity or Specialty Diagnostics. What I would say is its better than it's growing again, but there's still some level of noise in terms of volume disruption, right? So it's not at the consistent growth that you would have seen in 2018, 2019. You lose two or three weeks because of Omicron that has some minor effect. It's fully baked into our numbers, and it would be truly in the noise level for us in terms of what our outlook is. But you're not yet at sort of maximum diagnostic growth outside of COVID testing until you really have no capacity utilization in the hospitals. Dan Arias : Got it. Okay. Thanks Marc. Operator : The next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Derik De Bruin : Hey good morning. Marc Casper : Good morning. Derik De Bruin : So, Marc I don't know if you can do this, but it's the question we're getting from investors. But if you look at that 25.4% operating margin guide for 2022, what's the \u2013 I guess, can you do \u2013 can you talk to the push and takes on contributions or \u2013 what's the FX headwind? What's the decrease from PPD? And just \u2013 and basically in COVID sort of walk through the basis on what's sort of like the underlying margin? I think we're getting a lot of questions on that as people sort of think about sort of like the future trajectory. Marc Casper : Let me give you the 80,000 foot and I will not bridge you and Stephen will. We increased our operating margin outlook from the Investor Day. Actually, I think at the Investor Day, we did a really nice job of explaining, you bring PPD in at a lower margin in year one and margins expand. We talked a little bit about how the COVID would unwind, but also actually the longer-term view. So, we're kind of in a way, so let's go to the endpoint in the next three-year model or four-year model. And so that you can take all of the COVID out and you see the growth in margins off of that level. So actually, I'm super excited to come here and actually, we've been able to increase it. But Stephen, maybe you might want to add a little bit more. Stephen Williamson : Yes. So, in terms of the long-term model, we said margins are greater than 26%. And that's all incorporated in this guidance as we think about 2022 as the year in that three-year long-term model. So, we raised our guidance for revenue. PPD is part of that, which is kind of mid-teens margin. FX is slightly more of a hurt in terms of the change versus the prior guide. And then the higher testing and the higher core business growth is coming through the decent margin. So that's the kind of puts and takes that gets you the 20 basis point increase. And it's all in line. It's actually slightly higher than what included in that full year model that we gave out at the Investor Day. Derik De Bruin : Great. And Marc, your APAC and China business actually ended the year quite strong. Do you sort of like give us your current thoughts on sort of like how you see China moving forward in 2022 and 2023 and just your high-growth markets in general, just how things are tracking there? Thank you. Marc Casper : Yes. So, Derik thanks for the question. So, we had very strong growth in APAC, about 20% for the year and China just below, I think, 19%. So, it's kind of in the same range. When I look at the outlook, China being the largest of the countries in that region, it represents about 8% of our total revenue despite context. We expect it to be and continue to be one of our fastest-growing end markets. Significant investment in pharma and biotech, biotech in particular, in the country. We're well positioned to continue to serve that very well. So, the team in China is bullish about the outlook. There are clearly geopolitical tensions and we'll. Navigate those appropriately. And so that's part of it. And so, we feel good about what the outlook is there. And then we've had really good strength beyond China, right? South Korea continues to perform at a really good level. We played very strong role in India, and that's expanding nicely. The region has been good for us, and I'm very proud of how the team has performed in Asia-Pacific and obviously around the world. Derik De Bruin : Great. And if I can sneak one more in. The academic and government number in Q4, was that four less selling days and people not being back in the lab, some COVID headwinds just sort of talking, if you can sort of talk about that number? Marc Casper : Yes. So obviously, for the year, with the low double-digit growth, very strong. We had low single-digit decline, as you said, in the fourth quarter. Really, it's the combination, as you said, four selling days less. We also had a very strong comparison in academic and government in the prior year period. So that's probably the other factor beyond any Omicron-type disruption. So, as I thought about it, there was not much to read into it in terms of what the activity level was, what customers are talking about, pipeline stuff seems fairly normal. Stephen Williamson : And then Derik, just reflecting on the margin \u2013 Derik, just reflecting on your margin question, when I think about the additional guide in terms of revenue for testing, that's assumed to come through at the average for the pull-through of the rest of the company as well. So not a significantly high margin profile, so I guess is the [indiscernible]. Rafael Tejada : Thanks, Derik. Derik De Bruin : Great, helpful. Operator : We take our next question from Luke Sergott from Barclays. Please go ahead. Luke Sergott : Hey guys, good morning. I think everybody right now is trying to figure out the industry's capacity to absorb the COVID vaccine roll off. And given you guys supply, also manufacture and then do the clinical side, your thoughts here would be really helpful. But really just trying to figure out what indications or technologies are you guys are looking at that can replace any of that roll off? Marc Casper : Luke thanks for the question. So, when I think about the demand profile and capacity expansions, obviously, there has been very significant demand across the industry for supporting all of the COVID therapy and vaccine activity. And the industry, obviously, utilization went up hugely, probably unsustainably high. So, some of the investments you're seeing within our own company and sure, across others, is to bring utilization rates back to normal, right. So, that's the first thing to remind. Within our own business, if I think about the investments, I think about the nature of the customer contracts, I think about who the customers are, what else they have in their pipelines, our ability to transition the COVID-related activity to other therapeutic areas is something that we have a high degree of confidence in the ability to do that. You don't do it necessarily in one quarter, right. It takes a few quarters to get all of that smooth out. But we have good line of sight in terms of how to backfill when COVID demand is, God willing, less needed around the world, right, as we all hope that it's something that, at some point, wanes to a certain extent. So, our ability to do that, and you can think about a visualize right, sterile fill-finish activities, really all of the biologics that are used for any indication run through that capacity, right? So, we've added capacity and we're running flat out. And if there's less of a need longer term for vaccines, then you would see that capacity go to other critical areas. So that would be \u2013 you can visualize it that way. The capacity is truly generic to all of the indications out there. Luke Sergott : All right that's really helpful. And then lastly, as you guys look at that $1.75 billion on testing, Mesa appears to have had a really strong quarter. Can you just give us a sense of the number of customers there? I know it's such a small product line, but it's a key new platform for you. So, as you think about number of customers, placements and as the menu kind of expands there. Marc Casper : Yes, so you have two different things going on with our rapid diagnostic systems, our PCR, that we acquired early in 2021. You have the long-term menu expenditure beyond the respiratory panel and the COVID-19 test. That's a multiyear investment that really leverages the technology for the long term. And we're excited about that, right? When I think about \u2013 the second aspect of it is the role in COVID response, demand there has been very, very high. And while I could say the exact number of customers, you would see it in the pharmacies, is a natural application where it's been used, you see it in the doctor offices, as well as in number of back-to-life settings. I've been to meetings where that technology has been used to clear people to be able to attend the meeting and you get a result in 30 minutes. So, it's an exclusive technology to get a PCR result that quickly. So, I feel good about the acquisition, how the technology road map is developing and how it's performing. Luke Sergott : Great, thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore. Vijay your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys thanks for taking my questions. Stephen, maybe one on the guidance here. Good morning to you. On the guide here, 8% core, I guess, I heard you say in your core revenues was raised by $300 million, $400 million-ish. Shouldn't you core be 9%? Like it feels like it's improved versus your last guidance. Is that the right way to think about your core accelerating? Stephen Williamson : So, Vijay, good morning. The raise is because of the scale of the business has gotten larger in 2021, and then we're growing that at 8% going forward in 2022. So, the growth rate is still the same as our prior guidance for core, which is a very strong 8%. But the base in which it's growing is actually larger because of the way that we finished in the end of 2021. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And then one on margins in bioprocessing. Did your COVID testing margin assumptions change. I'm curious Marc on this DynaDrive single-use bioprocessing reactor. Do you expect any share shift in the industry? It looks like you guys are quite optimistic about this product. So, I'm curious if this is a share gain opportunity for Thermo? Marc Casper : Yes. So, Vijay in terms of the bioproduction activity. So, in that we say the word bioproduction, what we're meaning here is our cell culture media, our single-use technologies, our purification resins. That's part of a much bigger set of production activities for pharma and biotech, which includes pharma services and our bioscience reagents, some of those activities. I called out the DynaDrive specifically because today, when you think about a customer choice for most probably 70% to 75% of medicines and indications that are biologics, you can use single-use technology. That doesn't mean that that's the share that is used, which you can economically and the alternative is stainless steel. And that's a 2,000-liter scale. Our technology allows you to go to 5,000-liter scale. That effectively opens it up for almost all medicines could be made. And it's probably a couple of very high-volume ones want to do a stainless steel. Now how fast customers will ultimately adopt it? Will take some time. We've obviously adopted it in one of our biologics facilities. And we're super excited about the capability because the economics and the quality is fantastic. So, I think the technology is exquisite, and it's unique to us. So yes, I think it allows us to grow our share over time. Stephen Williamson : Basically, it expands our served end market in effect. Marc Casper : Yes. Vijay Kumar : Got you. And Stephen, sorry, did your COVID testing margin assumptions change versus the last guide? Stephen Williamson : In terms of the 2022 version, no. There is an assumption that it's going to contribute \u2013 come in the contribution margin around about the company average. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Thank you, guys. Rafael Tejada : Thanks, Vijay. Operator : The next question is from Dan Brennan from Cowen. Please go ahead. Dan Brennan : Great, thanks for taking the questions. Marc, just a quick just comment, just kick it off. I'm still unsure on Zach, what knowing [indiscernible] the last five means certainly gives me some hope. I just wanted to ask a question on the base biologics business, ex-COVID. I didn't hear it in the prepared remarks, but you may have discussed it. So how did that business grow in the quarter? Could you give some color on what the bookings trends were in the quarter? And kind of what's assumed implied in the 2022 growth for that business? Marc Casper : Yes. So, Dan, when I think about our biologics, our production activities, I think, it's probably good to put it into the macro context. Roughly $20 billion of our revenue today including PPD serves, pharma and biotech. About half of it is in the production part of the business, right? And in general, the production goes a little faster than the other activities we do in pharma and biotech. And when you look at the company's long-term 7% to 9% core organic growth outlook, pharma and biotech will be the fastest of the growing end markets are growing faster than that on average going forward. So, we entered the year, obviously with very strong momentum, right, with 25% growth in pharma and biotech for the full year, a very special year. And we're excited about the growth prospects we have this year with the 8% core growth. Dan Brennan : Got it. And then maybe as a follow-up, just on the diagnostic testing side, you guys are obviously tremendously successful with COVID testing. I'm just wondering if you can comment on all the PCR platforms that you've expanded globally. What's the strategy? And what's some of the revenue contribution as COVID flows to kind of monetize maybe some content on those boxes? Is there something baked in to the base business or just how do we think about that opportunity for Thermo? Marc Casper : Yes. So, Dan, one of the things that we get questions \u2013 your question we get periodically. So, we try to at least frame it a bit in Stephen's remarks, where we expect in an endemic phase of COVID, about $100 million a quarter, $400 million a year of molecular diagnostics revenue related to the increased installed base, supporting COVID testing, the increased sample prep installed base. So that's a rough number. We'll give it more precision when we're actually in the endemic phase, but that's the view. When that exactly happens, we just assume that that starts in Q3, but that's an assumption, just like all of our testing things. We'll update that as we see how the pandemic plays out. Rafael Tejada : Operator, we have time for one more question. Marc Casper : Thanks Dan. Stephen Williamson : Thank you, Dan. Operator : Thank you. So, our final question comes from Tejas Savant from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Tejas Savant : Hey guys good morning. And thanks for squeezing me in here. Marc, one question for you on the M&A pipeline. I know it came up earlier in the call as well. But just curious as to philosophically get your view on how do you think of growth assets, specifically if an asset is not sort of minor EPS accretive near term, is that still sort of something that you would look at over here? Or would you sort of prefer kind of like the more PPD flavor of M&A? Marc Casper : Yes, so it's a great question, right. The way we think about acquisitions is really along our criteria, right. We start with is it strengthen the company strategically? Would our customers value it? And ultimately, does it create shareholder value? We start with the return on invested capital, the internal rates of returns. Before we get into the EPS or any of that stuff, we just say, is this a good long-term investment, right? And if it is, then we'll look at the shorter-term financials and say, is that an acceptable risk reward to us to take the activity? So, as you know, if you think about the many deals we have done, we actually haven't focused on, is it accretive to our organic growth or we've actually just focused on, is it a really strategic fit that strengthens the company that will create shareholder value. And we have an incredible track record of accelerating the growth of the businesses we acquire, right? So that's the cool thing. And you've seen us where over the years, we bought businesses like Life Technologies that was growing slower than the company average. Obviously, it's been unbelievable in terms of how fast it's grown in terms of at scale. And we're excited about PeproTech, which is a higher growth business, and we're excited about the prospects around PPD. So, thank you for the question. Marc Casper : So, let me wrap up and thank everybody for participating. We're obviously pleased with how we performed in 2021. We're in a really great position to achieve another excellent year in 2022. And as always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific, and we look forward to updating you as the year progresses. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you all for joining today's call. This now concludes. You may now disconnect your lines.",

So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today for our first quarter call.  As you saw in our press release, we had a very strong start to the year. We delivered another quarter of excellent financial performance. Our core business is performing very well. That strength is broad based, including PPD, our clinical research business, where the integration is going smoothly and we're even more excited about the opportunities we have to further enable the success of our pharma and biotech customers. As I reflect on the quarter, I'm very pleased with the team's great execution and the share gain we saw across our business. Our continued success as the result of our proven growth strategy and our PPI business system, which continues to be a differentiator for us. It enables our team to further strengthen our company by finding a better way every day. When I think about the macro events much has changed since the start of the year. The war Ukraine, rising inflation, COVID lockdowns in China. What hasn't changed is our ability to navigate a dynamic landscape and deliver exceptional performance. You'll see that in our first quarter results and outlook for the year. So let me recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter grew 19% year-over-year $11.82 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $3.45 billion. Our adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 29.2%. And we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $7.25 per share. Let me now give you to color on the performance by our end markets. Building on the momentum from 2021 we delivered excellent performance to start the year. Our outstanding results this quarter were due to our team\u2019s strong execution, good market conditions, and share gain. We also had meaningful contribution from COVID-19 testing as we continue to support our customers\u2019 needs. Starting with pharma and biotech, we had another outstanding quarter of performance delivering growth in the mid-teens. We broad base strength in this end market, as our customers value our trusted partner status. In the academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digit during the quarter, with good growth in biosciences, electron microscopy, and our research and safety market channel. Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the mid-teens during the quarter. We saw strong growth in all of our analytical instrument businesses. Electron microscopy, chromatography, mass spectrometry and chemical analysis, as well as in the research and safety market channel.  And finally in diagnostics and healthcare, Q1 revenue declined in the mid-teens. In the core business we saw strong growth in clinical diagnostics, transplant diagnostics, and the healthcare market channel. During the quarter the team executed really well to support COVID-19 testing needs. Let me now provide an update in the progress we made in Q1, executing our proven growth strategy, which consists of three elements, a commitment to high impact innovation, scale in the high growth and emerging markets and a unique value proposition to our customers. We made great progress in the first quarter, and I'll share just a few of the highlights. Starting with the first pillar, it was a fantastic quarter for high-impact innovation, as we launched a number of new products that will help our customers break new ground in our important work. A few of the highlights. In our genetic sciences business, we launched our Applied Biosystems SeqStudio Flex Series genetic analyzer to improve clinical research and advanced scientific discovery. In Analytical Instruments, we launched four new Gas Chromatography and GCMS instruments to advance analytical testing for food, environmental, industrial, and pharmaceutical applications. This includes the Thermo Scientific TRACE 1600 Series Gas Chromatograph, which incorporates enhanced automation for instrument health monitoring, and offers flexibility for customers to optimize their workflow. In bioproduction, we launched the Gibco CTS Xenon Electroporation system for the efficient delivery of genetic material into cells, as part of cell therapy manufacturing. In addition, we signed an agreement with precision diagnostic company Oncocyte, to develop two new assays for our Ion Torrent Genexus System to improve cancer tumor profiling, and advanced precision medicine. This is just a small sampling of the outstanding innovation going on across our company, enabling our customer success and strengthening our position as the world leader in serving science. The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale and high growth in emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers. We had strong performance in these markets, including China, which grew double-digits in the quarter. Our Analytical Instruments business are being used around the world to advance scientific research, including the high growth and emerging markets. For example, in Beijing, the National Institute of Biological Sciences is using our mass spectrometers to accelerate their research in structural biology. And in Korea, our electron microscopes are enabling researchers at Pusan National University to establish a bio imaging center to accelerate virus research. Now turning to the third pillar of our growth strategy, our unique customer value proposition. We continue to enhance our capabilities, so we can be an even stronger partner and industry leader. To help our customers advance cell and gene therapies we opened a new bio repository in Vacaville, California. This facility will provide specialized biological sample storage and cell therapy logistics. In bioproduction our network expansion is going well. During the quarter, we brought on additional capacity online for single use bio process containers and cell culture media. Reflecting our trusted partner status with pharma and biotech customers, we entered a 15-year strategic collaboration agreement with Moderna to establish large scale U.S. manufacturing of mRNA-based vaccine and therapies. Under this agreement, we'll provide dedicated capacity for a range of aseptic fill-finish services, along with inspection labeling and final packaging. During the quarter, I had the chance to visit our Greenville, North Carolina campus, where we've invested significantly over the past couple of years to expand our capacity and capabilities. And the new building that will support Moderna\u2019s pipeline, it's truly impressive. Now, turning to capital deployment. I'd like to share some of the other steps we've taken to further strengthen our customer value proposition and build our future. We continue to successfully execute our discipline capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. Given this was the first a full quarter of contribution from PPD, our new clinical research business, I'd like to update you on our progress. The business is performing very well and running ahead of the deal model, the strong start and outlook for the year is allowing us to increase our expectations for the business. Stephen will cover these details in his remarks. In terms of the integration, it's going very smoothly. Our customers are seeing the value of the combination, and we have realized our first commercial synergies securing new authorizations from pharma and biotech customers who value the combination of our capabilities, this bodes well for our long-term revenue synergies. To further fuel growth and support increasing demand from our biopharma customers, we've also invested to expand our clinical research operations in Richmond, Virginia. Finally, I've been super impressed with the team, as I've visited different sites. And together we're taking the business to the next level as part of Thermo Fisher to become an even stronger partner for our customers. As I mentioned on our last call, we closed on PeproTech, a leading provider of bioscience reagents late last year. I'm pleased to note that that business is also a great start and the integration is going incredibly well. During Q1, we completed a small bolt-on deal in analytical instruments to enhance our materials and structural analysis offering for our customers. And during the quarter, we also returned significant capitals for our shareholders. We purchasing $2 billion of our shares and increasing our dividend by 15%. Turning now to a brief update on our ESG initiatives. We marked a significant milestone during the first quarter, exceeding one million readily recyclable paper coolers ship to transport coal chain products without the use of traditional polystyrene foam coolers. This builds on our commitment to environmental stewardship and enabling broad adoption of sustainable solutions. In addition, we recently announced our partnership with the University of California in San Diego to advance an innovation, sustainability and talent development. This 10-year partnership will establish a network tech of technology centers focused on accelerating collaborative research and advancing innovations in a range of scientific fields. It will also accelerate educational opportunities, especially for under resource students, by engaging in joint stem and community outreach programs and supporting curriculum development, scholarships, fellowships, career mentoring, and recruitment Before covering guidance. I'd like to end my comments with a reflection on the events that are impacting our colleagues and the world at large. As always our top priority is the health and safety of our colleagues. We're supporting our colleagues, displaced from Ukraine with a variety of needs and together with our colleagues globally, we've made substantial donations to relief organizations, responding in Ukraine and enabling safe-haven countries. In China, where many of our colleagues are facing lengthy lockdowns and disruption in daily life due to the pandemic. We're providing care packages to residents in Shanghai who have faced limited food supplies. We're also recognize that inflation is challenging for our team, and we're going to provide a special payment this summer to our colleagues. Now, I'd like to review our 2022 guidance at a high level, and then Stephen will take you through the details. We're meaningfully raising our full year guidance. We're increasing our revenue guidance by $450 million to $42.45 billion, which would result in 8% reported revenue growth over 2021. And we're raising our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.22 to $22.65 per share. This guidance factors in are excellent Q1, includes a very strong core business outlook for the remainder of the year. And it incorporates the expected impact of the recent macroeconomic dynamics. Our Q1 results and our increased guide for the year reflects, how well the team is navigating these dynamic times. So to summarize our key takeaways from the first quarter. Our outstanding results in Q1 were driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI business system. Our business is performing very well and we\u2019re gaining market share. The PPD acquisition is generating strong returns, and we're really well positioned to continue to differentiate ourselves for all of our stakeholders. All of this has enabled us to raise our outlook for 2022 and further solidify our incredibly bright future. With that I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, we started the year with an excellent Q1. In the quarter, we delivered 16% core organic growth, $1.68 billion of COVID-19 testing revenue, $7.25 for adjusted earnings per share, and $1.6 billion of free cash flow. Revenue in Q1 was just over $1 billion higher than we'd incorporated in our previous 2022 guidance, with $700 million driven by a very strong start of the year for the core business and just under $400 million from testing. The strength of the core was brought-based across businesses and markets and geographies. Our PPI business system enabled us to generate very strong pull through on this revenue and adjusted EPS for Q1 was $0.84 higher than included in our previous guidance. So broad-based beat to start the year. Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance. Beginning with our earnings results, and as I mentioned we delivered $7.25 of adjusted EPS in Q1, up 1% versus the prior year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $5.61 down 5% versus the prior year. On the top line, a Q1 reported revenue grew 19% year-over-year. The components of our Q1 reported revenue increase included 3% organic revenue growth and 18% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 2% from foreign exchange. Core organic revenue growth in the quarter was 16% and as I mentioned, we delivered $1.68 billion of COVID-19 testing revenue. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in the current and prior year. In Q1, North America grew in the low-single digits. Europe was flat. Asia Pacific grew in the mid-teens, with China growing in the low-double digits. And rest of the world declined in low-single digits. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 2% and adjusted operating margin was 29.2%, 620 basis points lower than Q1 last year. Adjusted operating margins came in slightly higher than we'd have anticipated in our prior guidance for Q1 reflecting how well our growth strategy and PPI business system enables us to manage dynamic times. We executed strong pricing realization, productivity and volume leveraging the core business enabling us to appropriately address higher inflation, and this was more than offset by the expected impacts of incorporating PPD into our financials, lower testing volumes and the impact of strategic investments including continued investments in our colleagues. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 47.5%, 660 basis points lower than Q1 last year. For the first quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those of our adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.2% of revenue, a decrease of 20 basis points versus Q1 2021. Total R&D expense was approximately $360 million in Q1 representing growth of 14% over the prior year, reflecting our ongoing investments in high impact innovation to fuel future growth. Looking at results below the lines of the quarter, our net interest expense was $118 million, $5 million higher than Q1 last year largely due to acquisition financing activities. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14.1%. This was a 190 basis points lower than Q1 last year, driven by a tax planning initiative. Average diluted shares with $395 million in Q1, approximately $3 million lower year-over-year driven by share purchases, net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. Cash flow was another strong highlight for the quarter. Our PPI business system enables to deliver significant cash flow from the very strong top line performance. Cash flow from operating activities in Q1 was $2.2 billion, and free cash flow for the quarter was $1.6 billion. Our capacity and capability investments are progressing well and this quarter's net capital expenditures with $640 million. In January we returned $2 billion of the capital to shareholders through buybacks. Also during the quarter we increased our dividend by 15%. We ended Q1 with approximately $2.8 billion in cash and $33.3 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.6 times gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, and 2.4 times on net debt basis. And concluding my comments and our total company performance, adjusted ROIC with 18% reflecting the strong returns on investments that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on the performance about four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varies by segment and testing revenue was significantly higher in the prior year quarter, so that does skew some of the reported segment margins. And as previously mentioned we're referring to the acquired PPD business as our clinical research business, and that resides in the laboratory products and biopharma services segment. So moving onto the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q1 reported revenue in this segment increased 1% and organic revenue was 1% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q1 we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. This was upset by lower revenue in the genetic sciences business driven by lower testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income and Life Science Solutions decreased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 51.4% down to 280 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity that was more than offset by business mix and strategic investments. In the Analytical Instruments Segment reported revenue increased 9% in Q1 and organic growth was 12%. The strong growth in the segment this quarter was led by electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. Q1 adjusted operating income in a segment increased 10% and adjusted operating margin was 19.8% up 20 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull through and productivity, that was offset by strategic investments we're making across this segment. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q1 reported revenue declined 8% and organic revenue declined 7%. In the quarter, we saw a strong underlying growth in our healthcare market channel, transplant diagnostics and clinical diagnostics businesses, which was offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income decreased 17% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 23.9% down 260 basis points from the prior year. In Q1, we drove strong productivity. This was more than offset by business mix and the strategic investments in the segment. And finally in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, in Q1 reported revenue in the segment increased 51% and organic growth was 6%. During Q1, we had strong growth in the research and safety market channel and the laboratory products, businesses. PPD, our clinical research business is performing very well. And during the quarter, it grew a few points above the company average core organic growth rate. It contributed $1.66 billion of revenue to the segment in the quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 17% and adjusted operating margin was 11.4%, which is 340 basis points lower than the prior year. In the quarter, we drove strong productivity, which is more than offset by strategic investments and business mix. Let me now turn to our updated 2022 guidance, as Marc outlined, we\u2019re raising our full year revenue guidance by $450 million to $42.45 billion. We're also raising our core organic revenue growth outlook from 8% to 9% for the year. And on the bottom line, we're increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.22 to $22.65 for the year. So very strong outlook, particularly as it also factors in the notable macro developments that occurred following our last earnings call in February. Our team continues to do an excellent job navigating through a fluid macroeconomic environment to help us deliver outstanding results, reflecting the strength of our proven growth strategy and the power of the PPI Business System to operate with speed at scale. So, let me get into the details of the guidance raise, in terms of revenue there are three elements driving the raising guidance, $350 million higher assumed COVID-19 testing revenue for the year, a $200 million decrease due to the change in FX rates and a $300 million increase in the outlook for the core business. The core revenue raise incorporates a $350 million headwinds from the conflict in Ukraine and the lockdowns in China. And we chose to de-risk $600 million of vaccines and therapies revenue in the outlook, offsetting it with other core revenue. Our guidance now assumes $1.5 billion of COVID-19 vaccines and therapies revenue in total for 2022. Incorporating both of these and still being able to raise the full year outlook for the core shows that the business is performing very well. And as I mentioned previously, we're increasing the core organic growth outlook from 8% to 9% for the year. In terms of like COVID-19 testing revenue assumption, continuing the same de-risk approach to guidance as there a range of outcomes for the year. Our guidance now assumes $2.1 billion of testing revenue in 2022, which represents the $1.68 billion delivered in Q1, $225 million in Q2. And then an assumed endemic run rate level of a $100 million of revenue per quarter in the second half of the year. There are scenarios where testing demand could be higher than this level. And should that be the case? We're well positioned to support customer needs as we did in Q1 and we'll flow these benefits through our P&L, but for now we thought it was prudent to continue to take a de-risk approach to the outlook. In terms of profitability, we expected to deliver $90 million more adjusted operating income up to $450 million raise in revenue guidance. This reflects strong pull through on the additional revenue, partially offset by a $150 million of additional compensation to our colleagues to help them with the temporary impacts of insulation. We continue to expect the adjusted operating margin to be 25.4% in 2022. In terms of adjusted EPS, our stronger business outlook is enabling us to raise the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.22 from $22.43 to $22.65 further building on an already very strong outlook for the year. Let me provide you with a couple of other details on the 2022 guidance to help you with your models. PPD our clinical research business is now expected to deliver $6.7 billion in 2022 in revenue, which represents 11% core organic growth on a full year basis for this business, up three percentage points from our previous guidance. We now expect the business to deliver just over a $1 billion of adjusted operating income in 2022 and contribute a $1.98 to adjusted EPS in the year up $0.08 from our prior guidance. FX is now expected to be a year-over-year headwind of $700 million on revenue, or 1.8% and $0.54 on adjusted EPS. We continue to expect net interest expense of approximately $490 million for the year. We now expect an adjusted income tax rate of 13.1% in 2022, slightly higher than the prior guide driven by the improved earnings outlook. We continue to assume net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion. A guidance still assumes $2.5 billion of capital deployment, which is the $2 billion of share buybacks that we completed in January and $475 million of capital to return to shareholders through dividends. And we now estimate that the full year average diluted share count will be between 394 million and 395 million shares. And finally, a couple of comments on phasing to help you with your modeling, revenue dollars for the remainder of the year they're expected to be fairly linear with Q4 being slightly higher than Q2 and Q3. Core organic growth for Q2 is expected to be lower than Q3 and Q4 due to an estimated 200 basis point impact of lockdowns in China. And in terms of adjusted EPS phasing, we expect Q2 as a percentage of the full year to be just slightly lower than the comparable periods last year. To conclude we'd live an excellent start to the year, and we're in a great position to achieve our 2022 goals. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Rafael Tejada : Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Jack, please go ahead. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Hope you guys are doing well. My question \u2013 are on the Biopharma side. First question on clinical research so PPD growing over 20%, that's well above historical levels and what peers have been reporting so far. Just what is driving the acceleration? Can you comment on industry funding and your ability to gain share? Marc Casper : Yes, Jack, thanks for the question. So our clinical research business, formally PPD off to a great start. As a reminder, the business had tremendous success in 2021 delivering great performance, great authorizations, even from especially after the announcement, just incredibly focused on great execution. Customers are excited about the potential and that momentum continued into Q1. Very strong performance on revenue and really good growth and authorizations. As I look at what's going on in the industry and look at some of the other companies that have reported, our results look favorable to the results that we saw. So we feel good about that, as an external reference point. And the switch strength within PPD was broad based across the different customer types, the funding environment, it was actually a great start to the year. Integration's gone really well. We feel good about that, and I'm really excited that commercial team has secured our first wins that are what I would call synergy related in the form of new authorization. So really a very cool start to the year, and we're excited about what the potential holds for our clinical research business. Jack Meehan : Great. And as a second question, I wanted to square the new $1.5 billion target for the COVID vaccines and therapies with your ability to raise the core growth overall. So, if I look at the Patheon and bioprocessing businesses are they still growing high single digit plus is the COVID handoff taking place. And kind of, off that just, can you comment on how changing doses per vial and the new Moderna strategic relationship might factor into this? Marc Casper : Yes, so Jack thanks. It's a great question. We made a decision on the guidance on vaccines and therapies, actually just because the number of questions we were getting from investors relative to our enterprise value and the sort of net present value of the company was disproportionate, right? So, we just basically said, we had a really good start on vaccines and therapies for the year. We did just under $500 million of revenue, which was what we expected to do. The $2.1 billion that we put in the original guidance of vaccine therapy related revenue is actually still a number that can be achieved. I call it at the high end of the range. And as you know, we're involved in so many of the programs, we're involved in the vaccine programs and the therapy programs we're involved in the drug substance and the drug product. We're involved in the enabling technology. So it's across many of our different capabilities and we feel good about it. We chose to effectively reduce the number in the, sort of in the target because the core business is performing so well that we just wanted to take the dialogue really off the table, as you know the capacity that makes these products and provides the enabling technologies is truly repurposable to other customers and to other products within the biologic field. So, we're very encouraged by that. And then to your question, we are expecting very strong growth for our pharma services and our bioproduction business in 2022 and beyond. So Jack thanks for the questions. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Patrick, please go ahead. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. Marc, maybe on the China piece, I know Stephen touched on a 200 bit headwind for 2Q. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there, which businesses are being affected more than others? Obviously we're seeing Beijing entering the conversation this week, I guess, what have you guys assumed there in terms of escalations or what's going to happen. And then again are certain businesses poised to recover more quickly than others. Just curious your perspective there. Marc Casper : Patrick, thanks for the question. So, the team really did an excellent job in Q1 navigating the lockdowns as started towards the end of the quarter to deliver double-digit growth and to really work with the government to be able to supply the critical products that we provide to the customer base there, even in difficult circumstances. Very impressive. What our assumption is actually fairly straightforward. We're looking at the back half of the year that Q3 and Q4 are normal in China, back to strong growth. And as you know, the business there rebounded super quickly after the Q1 of 2020 disruption. So the economy is there is quite resilient. Our assumption is in this quarter, there's a couple points of headwind. We're baking into the numbers because the number of the customers are closed. Academic institutions in Shanghai would be closed so that, it'll take, a period of time for that to rebound and as activity ramps back up. So that's how we're thinking about it in terms of the quarter. And we were able to fully bake that into our guidance and Stephen in the revenue phasing, views, try to make it clearer that what our outlook is for Q2, which is still quite good, but feels a little bit of that pressure and then Q3, Q4 picks up from there. Patrick Donnelly : Sure. That's helpful. Thanks Marc. And then maybe just another one on the bioprocessing vaccine piece, appreciate the transparency in terms of what that looks like this year? Obviously to your point, it's a big investor focus even into 2023, is there a way to think of that $1.5 billion as we get into next year? I know you guys have rolled it into core and kind of thought, the rest of the bioprocessing business will mostly offset it. It's going to be a gradual decline. Has that thinking changed at all? Just wondering on your high-level perspective, how to think about that piece as we move forward. Thank you. Marc Casper : Yes. So, Patrick, thanks for the follow-up on that. So, I would think about it, the following, the timing of the transition and what the long-term demand for COVID there are so many scenarios, it's very hard to say which quarter, which year exactly how things play out, right? Because the capacity is re-purposable we will move that over time. And in our long-term model that Stephen presented last September, it effectively reflects that that's all transitioned by the end of the model period. So that it was part of core. It doesn't affect the 7% to 9% long-term outlook. As I looked to 2023, I mean, as a reminder, we play a role in both therapies and vaccines. So, they are on different cycles and different scenarios, which is, I think, most scenarios have the pandemic existing in some endemic form next year. And therefore, therapy demand should exist with some level of consistency and vaccines is a wide range of out outcomes. Obviously the smaller, vial, the single use actually drives more revenue per thing. So, you have a lot of moving pieces. And our job is to manage all of that, manage the transition at the right timeframe and we will. I think the one piece of new information that, I think, is interesting is one of our customers, not in the top tier of the activity level within COVID, actually just repurposed its own commitments to other therapies and activities. So that was actually made that transition even smoother for a portion of it. And basically, in the future basically is taking the commitments and say, when they don't need COVID capacity, they're going to basically use it for other thing. So, hopefully all that color gives you a sense that we'll manage that over time and will continue to deliver strong growth as a company. Patrick Donnelly : Very helpful. Thanks Marc. Marc Casper : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Derik, please go ahead your line is open. Derik De Bruin : Hi, good morning, everyone. Marc Casper : Good morning. Derik De Bruin : I've got one model question and then I've got one big picture question. So, on the model, can you walk us through the gross margin progression in 2022? We see things seems to continually sort of miss model the gross margin. Can you help us walk us through and understand the FX myths and inflation through headwinds are going through? Stephen Williamson : Yes, so Derik so let's think about the gross margins this quarter kind of another 47.5% level be slightly lower for the remainder of the year and still in the year in that kind of mid-40s. And I think what people are not fully baking in is the impact of PPD. That has sizeable change to the overall company's gross margin when you factor that in. And then FX is a little bit of negative in terms of the margin profile. But it's really the impact of testing coming down and then the benefit of having PPD in the business. I think that's probably the thing that's missing the most. Derik De Bruin : Got it. That's helpful. And I wanted ask about the Moderna agreement because it's really surprising to see 15-year agreement sitting in our space. It's just not really done. Can you talk about that in terms of like, what is sort of driving that and is there something you sort of see that you can do with other people in the biotech space? And you also mentioned some synergy wins with PPD, how should we think about that in the longer-term targets on PPD? Marc Casper : Yes, so, Derik, thanks for the question. So, as you know, we never really talk about specific customers unless a customer is announcing this on their own behalf, and then we're more than happy to make some high-level comments, right, because it's really, our job is to support our customers\u2019 activity. I think that our take is that we did a really good job of supporting our clients during the course of the pandemic across all of the different activities. And that enhanced our reputation, our trusted partner status with our customers. And as in the case of Moderna they had the opportunity to work with us and decided to leverage our capabilities in Greenville, North Carolina, and our expertise to support their future pipeline from a sterile fill finish perspective. And it's super exciting in terms of the capabilities of the things that we will support longer term from them there. We have many different models of how we work with our clients in our pharma services business. And it's our job to support them in the best way that they want. We do have what we call condo models, where customers have some dedicated capacity. We have the traditional fee-for-service models. And then we have some other innovative ones. The other public one obviously was announced a couple years ago, which was CSL, right, which is, we took over one of their facilities, we're going to be manufacturing one of their new therapies and they are expanding the collaboration with us. So, it's a long menu of options and our job is to help our customers navigate their future and be really valuable to them. Rafael Tejada : Thanks Derik. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Tejas Savant of Morgan Stanley. Tejas please go ahead, your line is open. Tejas Savant : Hi guys. Good morning. And thanks for the time here. Mark, a question for you on pricing, you've spoken in the past about taking elevated pricing increases your perhaps 2x the normalized level in 2022. Can you just refresh that assumption for us in the context of the sharper inflation here? And philosophically, how do you think about the point at which you need to be a little bit careful about starting to impact customer demand perhaps more in some segments than others? Marc Casper : Yes, it's a great question, right. So, when we think about living and navigating through an inflationary environment, our team is doing a good job of managing productivity and managing cost and mitigating what can be mitigated. So, I'm very pleased with that. Our expectation for pricing is \u2013 and in normally as you know, it's a half point to a point of price that we get within our business. And this year we would expect that price would be about double the high end of that range or about two points of price within our outlook for the year. So, it's our job to support our customers, to explain the inflations and where we can offset it and where we need customers to support us. And those dialogues have been constructive and positive. Tejas Savant : Got it. That's helpful. And then one quick follow-up on PPD. Any color you can share on RFP flow, there has been a little bit of a focus on delays and cancellations, particularly among sort of midcap biotech customers here. Obviously, you had strong performance in the quarter, you are taking your numbers up for the deal. But just curious if you can pass out sort of any commentary on that specific segment of their customer base? Marc Casper : Yes. So, when I look at the performance, I look at the pipeline, I look at the authorizations, which is the new wins. When I look at the revenue, when I cut it by the different types of customers, we had a really strong start to the year. When I look at, I read not all, but some of the different commentary, and the differing views out there my take is, is that there was nothing abnormal in cancellations in the quarter, there was no trend to any of that. And actually we are on track to deliver very strong results, but the 11% growth that we're looking at for this year is really impressive because last year we're spectacular, right? In terms of the growth that the business delivered. So against a challenging comp that's really, really encouraging, and authorization support that for this year, but also support the long-term expectations that this is a high single digit growth business. And when we drive, synergies, it can be better than that. So, super cool times, but obviously early. Tejas Savant : Thank you. Marc Casper : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the Vijay Kumar [Evercore]. Vijay, please go ahead. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations in a really strong Q1 start. Maybe one on guidance here, perhaps for Stephen. I think your prior guidance call for high singles and that high singles was consistent across base vaccine and PPD [ph] just given, given a vaccine outlook is now I think down 15%, 20% versus last year. How much is the core, base going up and how much is PPD going up under the new guidance assumptions? Stephen Williamson : Yes. So, Vijay, so outline in the prepared remarks, the strength of the PPD business is going up to 11% for the year. So that would be a strong contribution and can you characterize the vaccines and therapies, and then we're offsetting that all of that from vaccines therapy and it increasing our guidance. So the core business is increasing $350 million in the raise. So going up to 8% to 9% strong performance. And that's obviously taking into an account and that switching back in the therapies to core, and offsetting the impact of the macroeconomic implications in China and situation in Ukraine. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful Stephen and Marc maybe one for you here. I know that the street is worried about the outlook just given the macro, the 16% core and Q1 versus a 13% comp. And we're looking at stock comp of close to 30%. I mean, these are really, really strong, and I understand pharma biotech, perhaps being strong but looks like all segments are on fire. Maybe just talk about end markets health of end markets, and when you think about the upcoming Analyst Day, what kind of approach should we expect from Thermo, will vaccines be get rest will it be the rest approach or any thoughts and what we can expect into the analyst? It will be helpful. Marc Casper : Yes. I mean, I can't wait until May 18. It'll be super cool. We're going to have it back in person. It'll be a great way to showcase our team and showcase the great things going on at the company. And we'll explain some of the stuff today in some more detail. And so it'll be very positive from that perspective. When I think about the business, right, we highlighted some of the macroeconomic dynamics, right? Because if you watch TV, you read the papers, you're on the internet, whatever it is that you get the external world, it's a bumpy time in the world, but when you get within our four walls right now, it is awesome. I mean, it is an amazing time of the company the momentum is huge. The customers are doing well, we are gaining markets share, and it is super cool. And so, when I think about that environment of delivering 16% core growth against, a very challenging comparison, right? I think from recollection, we had 53% organic growth last year, and I think 13% base growth, and we had bookings that were even stronger than our revenue. So it gives you a sense of how good things are and all the geographies, all of the end markets were actually quite good. Right. So, I feel good about the outlook. I feel good about the momentum we were able to de-risk the vaccines and therapies, even though, I think there are scenarios that is going to be above that sort of de-risk level. And so I think, the world is super positive and, when I think about the macro, I worry about our colleagues. Like I worry about our colleagues in China. I worry about our 300 colleagues in Ukraine. That's the kind of stuff that when I read about macro, that's really where my concern is. It's less about the business self associated with it. Vijay Kumar : It's helpful perspective, Marc. Thank you. Marc Casper : Thanks Vijay. Operator : Thank you. And then next question comes from Rachel [indiscernible] of JPMorgan. Rachel, please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks and congrats on the quarter. So question on China, you flag the guidance incorporates the $350 million headwind from Ukraine and China. So could you just break out how much of that is specifically in China? And then can you talk about your approach to guidance just in terms of future lockdowns and how we should think about China growth return in 2023? Stephen Williamson : Yes, so roughly, Rachel, roughly half of that is related to China. And as Marc said it earlier on that China bounced back from the original depth of the pandemic pretty fast, and it's pretty resilient economy. So, we've learned from that to help our customers get a pack up and running where they've been out of the out of the workplace. And we're very focused on enabling that success when they're able to get back to positions of work. Marc Casper : Our guidance assumes it's all in Q2 in terms of construction for China. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks. And then could you spend a minute talking about what you're seeing in the clinical environment in terms of hospital capacity constraints and how funding is trending as well? Thanks. Marc Casper : Yes. So in terms of healthcare and diagnostics the core there was actually quite good. When I think about we had broad-based strength in terms of core growth there in the high single digits. So, I feel good about that. And there was obviously some level of COVID disruptions and things of that sort, but in aggregate, the results were strong across healthcare and diagnostics. And obviously we had less revenue in the testing, which is why the customer base is down, down roughly 15%, but underlying that the core is \u2013 was quite good and feels like that outlook will continue to be positive. Thanks for asking the questions. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink Securities. Puneet, please go ahead. Your line is open. Puneet Souda : Yes. Hi, Marc. Thanks for taking the questions. So first one it really from your vantage point which is obviously fairly large across pharma end markets, could you provide us a view into this growing question that investors have been asking around biotech funding overall? I mean, if you look at the quarter and what you are projecting in the outlook, one would say that's not the case at all. There are no questions on biotech funding, but if you look at the early stages of pre-clinical and clinical and maybe clinical trials overall, maybe could you outline for us what you're seeing here near-to-midterm and pay down [indiscernible], PPD and other businesses across the board? Marc Casper : Yes. So Puneet, what I would say is the end market, pharma biotech incredibly strong with the mid-teens growth organically and if you \u2013 because we do everything on an organic basis in our end market description as opposed to a core organic, as it gets too confusing to think about all the history, but if you included the PPD numbers in that end market, it would be better than the mid-teens. So very strong orders which is a good indication, now the future is really strong, right? So the activity level is very good and the outlook is very strong. And when we have our \u2013 we've completed all of our business reviews and we talk about what are they seeing within those different customer base? Actually, the outlook is good. So one way to think about is at a company level, you take a long-term perspective, right? We say our 7% to 9% core organic growth. Pharma biotech will be above that, but when you kind of work your way through the math around the assumptions, it doesn't nearly need to be the rate that is growing at to drive 7% to 9% growth, right? We had a 15% growth in pharma and biotech, and we grew 16% in the quarter, right? So when you have strong growth in that end market given that it's a little more than half our revenue, it really flows through hugely. And given the last 10-plus years, even longer than that of the growth we've been able to deliver in pharma and biotech, I'm super bullish about what our outlook is. And I can even remember I was here with the patent clips like years and years and years and years ago, and we actually grew well through those because we helped our customers navigate productivity challenges that they were facing. That was a large pharma dynamic and a long-time ago, but we're so attuned to our customer needs we helped them through it. So that's how I think about it, and I feel great about what the outlook is. Puneet Souda : That's super helpful, Marc. Just a clarification that Stephen on the analytical technologies, it obviously came in a strong you pointed to electron microscopy from targeted mass spec couple of those elements. And maybe could you elaborate what's driving this growth. I mean, when we looked at it even with the normal seasonality of the fourth quarter to first quarter, this was meaningfully strong. So what's driving the strength of the instruments in the first quarter when you look at the end markets and customers? Thank you. Stephen Williamson : Yes. So Puneet a great question. So I think about Analytical Instruments is we've had great bookings for few quarters now for the business, and as Marc mentioned at the beginning that really strength across all three aspects of that segment. And then I highlighted the two that the most significant contributors electron microscopy is in great position in terms of serving life science customers, as well as material science applications including very strong growth in semiconductor applications for, for that customer set, and a great growth in Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry as well. So it's a really broad-based strength across there and funding environment is been good for the end market. Rafael Tejada : Thanks for the question. Thanks, Puneet. Puneet Souda : Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Arias of Stifel. Dan, please go ahead. Your line is open. Dan Arias : Good morning guys. Thanks for the questions. Marc, on bio-production beyond COVID, are there any ships through noticeable trends that are taking place when it just comes to upstream versus downstream work in the portfolios that you have there? I mean, obviously the cell culture piece is driving a lot of what's going on, but just across the portfolio, I'm curious to whether there's any nuance to what you're seeing? Marc Casper : No, actually the performance was very strong. I looked at obviously the other companies that reported. I feel good about our performance in the bio-production defined that that way. And we had good strength in cell culture media, purification resins, pharma analytics and single-use technology. So actually, no, there's nothing there that sort of we gleaned in terms of that some difference. So actually its quite broad-based to strength. Dan Arias : Yes. Okay. And then maybe just on the share that you mentioned. How does China stack up there in terms of the opportunity and what you've seen just with the thought being that sometimes these global disruptions tend to shake out some of the smaller or the less agile players? I'm wondering if regionally that's becoming more noticeable or whether it's just sort of the baseline operating scenario that you see. Marc Casper : Yes. We're still looking at how others performed in China in the quarter. So I feel good about our double-digit growth and team's doing a nice job and the momentum is broad base. So our customers do value the scale and the depth of capabilities that we have. Like we really create a spectacular experience for our customers in China, so it doesn't surprise me that the business is performing well and we'll help them navigate the very challenging time with the pandemic and then get back to business as usual as that wanes. Rafael Tejada : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question today comes from Matt Sykes of Goldman Sachs. Matt, please go ahead. Your line is open. Matt Sykes : Great. Thanks Marc and Stephen. Congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the industrial applied end market as it relates to instruments, yet another strong quarter. Are there some secular growth drivers that you think are being underappreciated by the market is driving this growth above and beyond maybe some of the pent-up demand we saw last year? And maybe just maybe talk about some of the secular growth drivers, if you can identify them? Marc Casper : Yes. So Matt thanks for the \u2013 thanks for the final question. Yes. So as Stephen said the Analytical Instruments business had a really good start to the year. Good growth and revenue and really strong growth in bookings. I would say that the one end-market that's really; really humming is what I call broadly the material science applications, semiconductor advanced materials, battery technologies, really very strong growth. That's not implying that the life science is very healthy and doing well, and the businesses are doing really well. But I'd say the continued demand and outlook for the material science related business is really strong and that bodes really well for the growth of our instruments business this year and into next. So that would be the thing I'd probably highlight. Marc Casper : Thanks for the question today. And let me do a quick wrap up. So thanks everyone for joining the call. We're very pleased with the strong start and we're in a very good position to achieve another excellent year. And I look forward to updating you at our upcoming Investor Day on May 18th, and as always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks everyone. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call thank call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect your.",

I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may begin the call. Rafael Tejada : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading News and Events until August 12, 2022. A copy of the press release of our second quarter 2022 earnings is available in the Investors section of our website under the heading, Financials.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our second quarter 2022 earnings and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials. So with that, I will now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we had another excellent quarter. We delivered outstanding financial performance. Our core business is performing very well, that strength is broad-based across all our businesses. As I reflect on the quarter, I am very proud of the team\u2019s great execution and the resulting share gain we saw across our business. Our ongoing success is propelled by our proven growth strategy and our PPI Business System, which is a differentiator for us and enables operational excellence within the company. You will see this in our second quarter results and increased outlook for the year. So, let me first recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter grew 18% year-over-year to $10.97 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.61 billion. Our adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 23.7% and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.51 per share. Let me now give you some color on our performance by end market. Starting with pharma and biotech, we had excellent performance in this end market, delivering growth in the mid-teens. We saw excellent growth across all businesses serving these customers, highlighted by our bioproduction and pharma services businesses. We are continuing to benefit from our trusted partner status that we have earned over many years with our pharma and biotech customers. In academic and government, we grew in the mid single-digits in the quarter. We saw strong growth in biosciences and chromatography and mass spectrometry. Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the low double-digits for the quarter. We saw very strong growth in electron microscopy, chromatography and mass spectrometry and our research and safety market channel. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, revenue was 20% lower than the prior year quarter. In this end market, the core business saw strong growth led by immunodiagnostics and microbiology. During the quarter, the team continued to execute well to support customers\u2019 COVID-19 testing needs. Overall, excellent performance across our end markets. And as I reflect on this quarter\u2019s performance, we continue to deliver very differentiated core business growth. This was driven by three factors : the market conditions were good; our team managed lockdowns in China extremely well; and we had outstanding execution from our global team, resulting in meaningful share gain. Let me now provide an update on the progress we made in executing our proven growth strategy. The investments we have made and are continuing to make across the company are fueling growth and generating strong returns. Our growth strategy has enabled another quarter of excellent performance. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars : developing high-impact innovative new products; leveraging our scale in the high growth and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. I will start with innovation. We launched a number of new products across our businesses to further strengthen our industry leadership and enable our customers to accelerate scientific breakthroughs. I will highlight a few of these. We have an outstanding American Society for Mass Spectrometry Conference, where we showcased new instruments, consumables and software to advance our customers\u2019 work. These included the Thermo Scientific AccelerOme automated sample prep platform, which simplifies workflows for proteomic researchers by eliminating a range of previously manual steps. We also launched the cloud-based Thermo Scientific RDO software platform, which integrates functionality and data across multiple chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments to simplify application-specific workflows, helping scientists share information with each other and labs around the world and speeding the development of new diagnostics and therapies. In addition, we launched the Thermo Scientific Direct Mass Technology mode for our industry-leading Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometers. This technology allows for the characterization of complex and large biotherapeutics, which were previously challenging to interpret. In our biosciences business, we launched the Gibco CTS TrueCut Cas9 Protein that supports genome editing for applications such as CAR-T cell therapy research. Emerging therapies like CAR-T are providing new hope in treating cancer. And in Specialty Diagnostics, we launched the Phadia 2500+ series in the U.S., a high-throughput instrument for allergy and autoimmune diagnostics to help further improve lab efficiency. These new products and many others will make a significant difference for our customers and drive future growth for our company. Turning to our high growth and emerging markets, we are really thrilled with our team\u2019s progress. You may remember that we called out China as a potential Q2 headwind, because of the COVID-19 lockdowns in the country. Obviously, the lockdowns were very severe, but I am so proud of the way the team responded. They powered through demonstrating the relevance of our offering amid the crisis and delivered over 20% growth. That was the result of a very strong core business, the benefit of deep relationships we have with our customers, and our support for local COVID-19 testing. So overall, it was a great quarter and one that clearly demonstrates our growth strategy continues to deliver outstanding results. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our unique customer value proposition. Our capabilities enable our customers\u2019 ability to achieve their own goals for innovation and productivity. To be the best partner for our customers, we continue to enhance our capacity and capabilities. Let me share a couple of examples. In our flagship facility for cell culture media in Grand Island, New York, we just completed a capacity expansion to support customers\u2019 research, drug development and production applications. And in our lab chemicals business in Geel, Belgium, where we have our primary Continental European distribution center for lab chemicals, we just completed a major expansion of the facility to support the strong growth that we have been delivering. I have had the opportunity to visit both sides a number of times and it\u2019s really exciting to see the ongoing strength in customer demand that\u2019s driving the need for this investment. These are just a few reflections on the way we are supporting our customers by further strengthening our capabilities and value proposition. Now, turning to capital deployment, I\u2019d like to share some of the other steps we have taken to further strengthen our customer value proposition and build our future. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. We are very pleased with the performance of the PPD acquisition. The business is performing very well, delivering strong core revenue and earnings growth. In May, at our Investor Day, we increased the revenue synergy outlook by $100 million to $250 million in year 3 and the cost synergies in that year by $25 million to $100 million and the synergy opportunities continue to be incredibly exciting. I just had a chance to meet with the clinical research commercial organization and I am so impressed with the team and the opportunity that they see for enabling the success of our customers going forward. The combination of capabilities is really resonating with customers and we are seeing strong momentum in the business. All of this is leading to business performance well ahead of the deal market. The acquisition of PPD is another example of how our capital deployment strategy is creating customer and shareholder value. Turning now to an update to our ESG initiatives, we released our latest Corporate Social Responsibility Report. This report details our progress and disclosures for all of our key ESG initiatives and is a great example of how we are continually working to enhance our reporting and disclosure using internationally recognized reporting standards. It\u2019s great to see the progress detailed in the report and also reflecting the progress we have made through our commitment to ESG over many years. For this quarter, I will highlight the progress we continue to make on our goal to reduce our carbon footprint. As part of our efforts, we continue to transition to renewable energy is sold at onsite rooftop solar power at key locations to reduce our consumption of electricity produced with fossil fuels. We are also working with our suppliers on their climate performance goals which will ultimately have an impact across our value chain. As a leader in ESG, our commitment to progress is ingrained in everything we do and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we go forward. Now, I\u2019d like to review our updated 2022 guidance at a high level and then Steve will take you through the details. We are meaningfully raising our full year guidance. We are increasing our revenue guidance by $700 million to $43.15 billion, which would result in 10% reported revenue growth over 2021 and we are raising our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.28 to $22.93 per share. This higher outlook primarily reflects the strength of our core business and additional contribution of COVID-19 testing revenue, which are more than offsetting the increased foreign exchange headwinds, demonstrating how well we operate with speed and scale to enable our customer success and navigate dynamic macro environments. So, to summarize our key takeaways from the second quarter. Our outstanding results in Q2 highlight the benefits of our proven growth strategy, our PPI business system and our extraordinary team. Our business is performing very well and we are gaining market share. The PPD acquisition is generating strong returns. We are really well positioned to continue to differentiate ourselves for all of our stakeholders. And the team is doing an excellent job navigating the dynamic times we are living in. All of this has enabled to raise our outlook for 2022 and further solidify our incredibly bright future. With that, I will now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc and good morning, everyone. We delivered another excellent quarter in Q2. This included 13% core organic revenue growth, $630 million of COVID-19 testing revenue, $5.51 of adjusted earnings per share, and over $1 billion of free cash flow. Revenue in Q2 was $930 million higher than we had incorporated in our previous 2022 guidance, with $640 million driven by ongoing strength in the core business and $400 million from testing, partially offset by $110 million due to higher headwind from foreign exchange. Similar to last quarter, the strength in the core was broad-based across businesses and end markets. From a geographic lens, $200 million of the beat was from China. In our previous guidance, we had assumed a $200 million headwind from the lockdowns in China and we offset all of that, half from strong local core growth and half from local testing support, a great achievement by our China team. Our PPI business system enabled us to generate very strong pull-through on the revenue beat and adjusted EPS for Q2 was $0.52 higher than included in our previous guidance. So Q2 was a continuation of our excellent financial performance track record. Let me now provide you with some more details. Beginning with our earnings results, as I mentioned, we delivered $5.51 of adjusted EPS in Q2 and GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.22. On the top line, our Q2 reported revenue grew 18% year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue increase included 3% organic revenue growth, a 19% contribution from acquisitions, and a headwind of 4% from foreign exchange. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, the organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in the current and prior year. In Q2, North America grew in the high single-digits, Europe declined in the low double-digits, Asia-Pacific grew in the low double-digits, with China growing over 20% and rest of world declined low double-digits. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 23.7%, 530 basis points lower than Q2 last year. Adjusted operating margin was slightly higher than we had anticipated in our prior guidance for Q2, reflecting how our growth strategy and PPI business system enabled us to continue to manage dynamic times. In the quarter, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation while also driving strong productivity and positive volume leverage in the core business. This was more than offset by the expected impact of incorporating PPD into our financials, lower testing volumes and continued strategic investments, including investments in our colleagues. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 43.2%, 740 basis points lower than Q2 last year. For the second quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.1% of revenue, a decrease of 180 basis points versus Q2 2021. The R&D expense was approximately $360 million in Q2, representing growth of 6% over the prior year quarter. You can see the benefits of our prior R&D investments in our differentiated core organic growth rate and the exciting new products that Marc outlined. Moreover, the continued investments we are making in R&D are helping to fuel an even brighter future. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $112 million, approximately flat to Q2 last year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13%. This was 100 basis points lower than Q2 last year, driven by our tax planning initiatives. Average diluted shares were $394 million in Q2, approximately $2 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $3.7 billion and free cash flow was $2.6 billion. Our capacity and capability investments continue to progress well and our year-to-date net capital expenditures were $1.1 billion. We returned over $115 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter and this reflects the 15% dividend increase we announced in February. We paid down $1.85 billion of commercial paper in Q2 and ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion in cash and $30.3 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.3x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.2x on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 16.6%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we are generating across the company. Now I will provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varies by segment and the testing revenue was significantly higher in the prior year quarter that does skew some of the reported segment margins. And as I mentioned earlier, we are executing strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. And as we outlined at the beginning of the year, we are referring to our acquired PPD business as our clinical research business and that resides in laboratory products in Biopharma Services segment. So, moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Science Solutions, Q2 reported revenue in this segment declined 7% and organic revenue was 5% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction business. This is offset by lower revenue in the genetic sciences business driven by the moderation in testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 40.3%, down 800 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable business mix and the strategic investments we are making across the segment. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 9% in Q2, and the organic growth was 13%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was led by electron microscopy and the chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in this segment increased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 21.4%, up 250 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we delivered strong volume flow-through and productivity that was partially offset by strategic investments. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics, in Q2, reported revenue declined 11% and organic revenue was 8% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we saw strong underlying growth in our immunodiagnostics and microbiology businesses, as well as our healthcare market channel. This is offset by lower COVD-19 testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. While Q2 adjusted operating income decreased 1% in the quarter, adjusted operating margin was 22.1%, up 220 basis points from the prior year quarter. In Q2, the impact of lower testing volume was more than offset by strong productivity enabled by our PPI Business System and positive business mix. And finally, in Laboratory Products & Biopharma Services segment. Q2 reported revenue increased 55%. Organic growth was 10% and the impact of acquisitions was 48%. During Q2, we had strong growth in the research and safety market channel and in the Pharma Services and Laboratory Products businesses. PPD, our clinical research business, is performing very well and continues to exceed our expectations. During the quarter, it grew slightly higher than the rest of the segment, contributing $1.72 billion of revenue. Q2 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 55% and adjusted operating margin was 12.5%, which is 10 basis points higher than the prior year quarter. In the quarter, we drove strong productivity and also still the benefit from acquisitions. This was partially offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. Let me now turn to our updated 2022 guidance. And as Marc outlined, we\u2019re raising our full year revenue guidance by $700 million to $43.15 billion. We\u2019re also raising our core organic revenue growth outlook from 9% to 11%. And on the bottom line, we\u2019re raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2022 by $0.28 to $22.93. The increase in revenue guidance is driven by three elements : a $750 million increase in the outlook for the core business; $500 million higher assumed COVID-19 testing revenue; and a $550 million decrease to reflect the recent changes in FX rates. Let me provide you some color on each of these elements. So starting with the $750 million increase in the outlook for the core business, this reflects a strong performance in Q2 and a $100 million increase in the core organic outlook for the second half of the year, and that second half raise reflects higher price we put in place to offset higher inflation versus the previous guidance. As I mentioned previously, the increase in core revenue guidance raised the full year outlook for core organic revenue growth from 9% to 11%. This very strong growth performance reflecting excellent commercial execution and strong share gains. In terms of our COVID-19 testing revenue assumptions, the $500 million increase for the year includes $400 million beat in Q2 and a $100 million increase in the assumption for Q3. This reflects an assumed glide path from Q2 to an endemic run rate level in Q4. There continue to be scenarios where testing demand could be higher than this level. And should that be the case, we\u2019re well positioned to support customer needs. And as we did in the first half of the year, will flow the benefits of that through our P&L. But for now, we thought it was prudent to continue to take a de-risked approach to the outlook. In terms of FX, we\u2019ve incorporated current rates into guidance, and we now expect FX to be a year-over-year headwind on of $1.25 billion on revenue, up 3.2%. The FX headwind on adjusted EPS in 2022 has increased by $0.31 to $0.84 for the full year or 3.3%. The $0.31 change includes a 34% headwind in the second half of the year versus that previous guidance. In terms of profitability, we expect to deliver $110 million more adjusted operating income, up the $700 million raise in revenue guidance. This reflects strong pull-through in the higher core and testing volume, additional price offsetting inflation and the impact of the headwind from FX. We now expect full year 2022 adjusted operating margin to be 25.2%. In terms of adjusted EPS, our stronger outlook is enabling us to raise the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.28 from $22.65 to $22.93, further building on an already very strong outlook for the year. So to recap on the guidance change, we continue to execute really well and are able to more than offset the significant FX headwinds, effectively manage inflation and still raise our full year outlook. This demonstrates the power of our proven strategy and our PPI business system execution. Let me now provide you with a couple of other details on the 2022 guidance. PPD, our clinical research business is now expected to deliver $6.8 billion of revenue in 2022, which represents 12% core organic revenue growth on a full year basis for this business, up 1% from our previous guidance. We now expect the business to contribute just over $2 to adjusted EPS in the year, up $0.03 from our prior guidance. Our guidance now assumes net interest expense of approximately $460 million for the year. We\u2019re assuming an adjusted income tax rate of 13.2% in 2022, slightly higher than the prior guidance. We continue to assume net capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion and free cash flow of approximately $7 billion. Our guidance still assumes $2.5 billion of capital deployment, which is a $2 billion of share buybacks to be completed in January and $475 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. And we continue to assume the full year average diluted share count will be between 394 million and 395 million shares. And finally, I wanted to touch on spacing of the P&L to help you with your modeling. When I think about the revenue dollars in Q3 and Q4, we expect Q4 to contribute just under 52% of the second half total. And looking at adjusted EPS on that same basis, we expect the second half total to be weighted a couple of percentage points more to Q4 than the revenue. To conclude, we delivered another excellent quarter and in a great position to achieve our 2022 goals. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Raf. Rafael Tejada : Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we\u2019re ready for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. You may proceed. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Marc Casper : Hi, Jack. Good morning. Jack Meehan : Good morning. So versus the Analyst Day at the end of May, a lot has transpired on the macro environment. We see this morning, GDP officially declined again for 2Q. It would be great to hear just your latest thoughts on macro sensitivity for Thermo Fisher. And if you\u2019ll humor me as we sit here in July, just any thoughts on positioning for 2023, how that might fit in versus the 3-year CAGRs you talked about a couple of months ago? Marc Casper : Yes. So Jack, I guess the first thing is business performing extraordinarily well, right? We have broad-based strength. As I look at the companies that have reported, we\u2019ve done very well from a top line perspective. So I feel good about how we\u2019re performing. Bookings performance was very good. So if I think about what are we seeing in our business, we\u2019re seeing very strong strength, right? In terms of the macro, obviously, when you read the papers or wherever information source, lots and lots of challenges in the world. And in the last quarter, we articulated some of them and how we factored some of that into the thinking for our outlook. And so what do we think about sensitivity? This company is incredibly well positioned to navigate whatever the world throws at us, right? And the industry in and of itself is attractive as well as sensitive economically than many. We are very well positioned within it, and we have tremendous momentum. When I think about \u2013 if we see a downturn, and we\u2019re not seeing the signs of one, but it doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be one. We have the benefit of a track record of dynamic of navigating dynamic times and exiting those periods really an incredibly strong industry leader. We benefit from an experienced management team, an incredible team around the world, a proven growth strategy in a PPI business system, which gives us great operational discipline. As you know, we\u2019ve taken a number of actions over the last few years to strengthen our position in the end markets we serve. And today, relative to the recession and the great financial crisis, we have less industrial exposure. As a reminder, about 30% of our revenue going into the last recession was industrial. Today, it\u2019s about 13%. And Pharma and Biotech is much larger, and that has been the least economically sensitive of the end markets, and that represents just under 60% of our revenue. And when I think about our mix, we\u2019re more service and consumables oriented than we were then. Then, it was 65% of our revenue. Today, it\u2019s 82% of our revenue. So the company is performing well. Our end markets are good, and we will manage through whatever the world throws at us. And you see that in the results, right? You see that in the \u2013 FX got meaningfully more challenging for all global companies, and we\u2019re able to power through that and deliver an increase in our guidance. Jack Meehan : Great. And then my second question is on capital allocation. So it looks like it was a relatively quiet quarter here, though I know you\u2019re always very active internally. Just \u2013 it would be great to get your thoughts on the deal pipeline. Do you think it\u2019s getting more interesting with some of these macro challenges around the world? And then given PPD\u2019s strong performance here out of the gate, just thoughts on adding more CRO exposure to the business? Marc Casper : Yes. So from a capital deployment perspective, I really wanted to do the deeper dive on the progress of PPD, and we did a large acquisition in December, right? And the first thing we have to demonstrate is that we\u2019re great owners and operators of the businesses that are part of the family, and that\u2019s always our number one priority, and that business has performed great. And we have an active pipeline. And when I think about how valuations have come in many sectors that creates opportunities, right? So we\u2019re actively engaged as we always are and we\u2019re well positioned to capitalize on the M&A opportunities that will be out there in the landscape. So thank you, Jack. Jack Meehan : Thanks, Marc. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. You may proceed. Patrick Donnelly : Marc, maybe one on the bioprocessing business, it continues to be a source of strength for you guys, among others. Can you just talk about the performance this quarter for that business? It seems like it accelerated for a few players across the industry. And then secondarily, inside that bioprocessing piece on the COVID vaccine side, are you still kind of \u2013 obviously, you de-risked a little bit last quarter. I think you lowered it $500 million, $600 million for the year. Maybe just updated thoughts on that front along with the core bioprocessing piece? Marc Casper : Patrick, good morning, thanks for the questions. So, when I think about bioprocessing, I always like to frame it in the context of how we serve former biotech, right? The market will level up, it\u2019s very attractive. We have a leading presence, and we\u2019re really well positioned to serve those customer base. And you\u2019ve seen us deliver really strong growth. When I think about production, right, or bioproduction, as a reminder, we have two major activities that we have within our company. We have our bioproduction business, which is the leading presence in cell culture media, single-use technologies and a rapidly growing purification resins business as well as our pharma services business, which is both drug substance and drug product for biologics. And you see us play with the monoclonal antibodies, viral vectors, cell therapy, plasmid, sterile fill, finish all part of that. So it\u2019s a large portion of our total presence in serving pharma biotech. Outstanding quarter, right, when I look at \u2013 and that was both across the services business and bioproduction. When I look at how others have done and reported, I feel very, very good about our performance. And the outlook here is really positive. When I think about your question on the COVID vaccine therapies, our outlook for the year is $1.5 billion. That\u2019s the same as it was in Q1. We did just over $400 million of revenue in Q2, which was right in line with our expectations. It brings us to a little bit over $900 million at the halfway point of the year. So we feel good about our role in supporting our customers\u2019 activities in vaccines and therapies. That\u2019s part of our core revenue growth. So over time, when there is less demand for those capabilities, we will transition that well to other applications, which we do all the time. Patrick Donnelly : That\u2019s really helpful, Marc. And then maybe just on the pricing side. I know Stephen kind of talked about that being a key bridge to raising the guidance in the back half. I think you previously discussed maybe 2x the normal in pricing to combat inflation. Can you just kind of update where we are on the pricing side? Any pushback from customers? Just maybe just what those conversations have been like? Obviously, pricing power has obviously been a great thing for you guys over the years, but that this is getting to be the highest level we\u2019ve seen. So maybe just talk a little bit about the pricing side. Thank you, Marc. Marc Casper : I\u2019ll start with the customer comments, and Stephen will go through his thoughts. We\u2019re incredibly transparent with our customers and a partner to enable their success. So we\u2019ve had very constructive discussions, and we\u2019ve operated with transparency and has allowed us to get an appropriate level of pricing. Stephen Williamson : Yes. So Patrick, in terms of the setup on pricing, then back to kind of a normal year for us, about 0.5% to 1 percentage point of net price across the whole business. And for the first half of the year, we\u2019ve been running kind of slightly north of double the high end of that range. And the additional pricing we put in place is really to offset higher inflation that we\u2019re seeing largely energy costs in Europe as we think about the change in guidance. And that change in guidance is really slightly higher revenue and no impact on adjusted operating income or adjusted EPS, but a little pressure on margin, which is the reason why the overall margin came down in the guidance from the last guidance. But that\u2019s kind of active management of the pricing to offset the additional inflation. Patrick Donnelly : Helpful. Marc Casper : Thanks, Patrick. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik, you may proceed. Mike Ryskin : Great. Thanks for taking the question. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik. Marc, I want to follow up on a lot of your comments in the prepared remarks, you really seem to emphasize share gains again this quarter. And the core business is doing really well in a number of different segments. So curious if you could provide a little bit more color on some specifics on where you\u2019re seeing the biggest share wins versus your peers? Is it in sort of the core chromatography and mass spec and AI or in the channel or bioprocessing portfolio we\u2019re just talking about? Just sort of what\u2019s working well and what\u2019s allowing you to take that share? And any specifics you can give on individual pieces of the business would be helpful. Marc Casper : Sure, Mike. Thanks for the question. So when I think about the 13% core growth \u2013 the 14% core growth for the first half, really strong momentum in the business and very broad-based, right? So that\u2019s exciting. And when I look at how the industry is reporting, we\u2019re faring very well. So I\u2019m proud of the team\u2019s efforts. So some of the highlights, geographically, the team is doing incredibly good job in China. So that\u2019s one lens. End market lens, pharma biotech going incredibly quickly, right, with mid-teens growth. So that\u2019s another of lens. And then the way you framed it, from the businesses perspective, analytical instruments is doing very well. It\u2019s going to see the 13% growth in the segment, great performance in electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry. Our channel is performing well, pharma services. And then while it doesn\u2019t it\u2019s in the core. Our PPD acquisition has performed very well. We\u2019ve obviously had the benefit of seeing a couple of industry participants report and that business is going well. And to be candid, it\u2019s pretty much broad-based cost business. I haven\u2019t mentioned either. It\u2019s not the \u2013 I didn\u2019t say something to us not doing well. The team is really humming right now. Mike Ryskin : Okay, great. And then for the follow-up, if you look at how this year has trended sort of what you\u2019re implying for the rest of the year, what you\u2019re guiding for the rest of the year for COVID diagnostics. There is still going to be a little bit of a cliff as we go into next year, a little bit of a reduction in COVID diagnostics from \u201822 to \u201823, just given what you were able to accomplish in the first half of the year. But the base business is doing incredibly well, and you\u2019re now guiding to 11% core business. So, you have got your multiyear target of 7% to 9% out there, right? If we are using this year as a jumping off point, is there any reason to think that next year shouldn\u2019t be squarely in that range as well despite the comps and then sort of adjusting for the COVID diagnostic delta between $2.5 billion this year to the run rate next year? I am just trying to do the bridge between the base and the COVID diagnostics, sort of where that puts the model. Marc Casper : So, Mike, I guess a few thoughts on 2023, right. And obviously, I am looking forward \u2013 I am actually doing it every day, it\u2019s not that. But when we get to January, I will be looking forward to giving you the \u2013 give you the update on sort of what we think for the year, right, so in the details. What we don\u2019t know now, right. And it\u2019s just nobody knows is what\u2019s the macro environment, right. Is it \u2013 was it like the first half of this year, well, phenomenal, right, or is it different, and so we will appropriately set the context for 2023, when we get there. But I think there are a couple of things that are worth saying at this point in time to at least help you think about it. One is the core business, right. It\u2019s going to be large, right. We are growing the business faster this year than we had outlined in the long-term model. So, I mean the jumping off point in 2023 is we are going to have a bigger business. And that\u2019s core that drives earnings power and all of those things. We will have an appropriate growth range based on how we see the world at that point in time. We will figure that out as it gets closer. And then Stephen might \u2013 do you want to comment on FX and because I know that the movements have been enormous, and you might want to frame how to think about that for next year. But I feel great about how the core business performed. Stephen Williamson : Yes. I think looking at FX rates, if they stayed the same as they are now, that will be kind of an additional year-over-year headwind next year, about $600 million, about $0.40 of adjusted EPS. And I think about the mix of currencies and where currencies have changed. Obviously, that could change as we go through the year, but something to watch out for in corporate. Marc Casper : Yes. And Mike, when I think about the 7% to 9% growth, that\u2019s the long-term sort of average we worked through. So, it can vary in a given year, as this year, obviously, is above that, it can be within and it can be different, just depends on the measure we use is, are we delivering really good performance, right. And it\u2019s going to be in the context of what\u2019s the environment. So, that\u2019s going to wait until January. Thanks for the questions. Mike Ryskin : Very appreciated. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. You may proceed. Rachel Vatnsdal : Hey. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. So, my first question is on China. Growth of over 20% in the quarter was very impressive. You flagged that some of that was driven by COVID testing. So, can you just break out what was the COVID contribution versus core growth in China? And then what are your latest expectations for China for the year, given some of the headlines you have been seeing about additional lockdowns? Marc Casper : Yes. So \u2013 when I think about the business in China, the team really did an excellent job I think really difficult circumstances. They basically had a month in the Shanghai region to basically get the business to really incredible performance in June. So, I am very proud of that. We had good growth in the core business, much better than we expected. And a nice chunk of the overdrive in COVID testing was in supporting the local activities. So, we did a really good job there. We don\u2019t sell our assays there, but we do sell our instruments and in our reagents to support local demand. So, we had strong core growth and a meaningful response in China, actually larger than we typically have in China for COVID testing. The way I think about the outlook is it should be a good market in the second half of the year. I have no doubt there will be some level of COVID disruption. What that will be, when it will be, where it will be, hard to know. But just given the zero COVID policies, there will be bumps on the road. But the team knows how to navigate that, and I feel like we will get through that period effectively. And there could be some headwinds here or there, but nothing that we see at this point in time in China. It looks very strong. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great to hear. And then can you just give us an update on what you are seeing for earlier-stage work in biopharma, just given some of the funding concerns pressuring those mid-cap biotech customers. I know that\u2019s a small percent of your revenue, but still just any dynamic and color on what you are seeing in that market would be helpful. Thanks. Marc Casper : Yes. So Rachel, thanks for the question. Pharma market has been very strong. One of the questions because as our investors and analysts ask the question. I asked the team about are there patterns, trends, anything that is jumping out. And it\u2019s actually been broad-based strength, right. We are seeing good growth in the various sub-segments within the customer base. So, I feel like the momentum is strong. Orders were strong. There is always company-specific challenges right. There will be companies that have bad data, bad report out or a company that\u2019s going to a cat and whatever [ph]. And we help those companies navigate those times. We help them drive productivity and accelerate innovation, and those things. But we continue to see strong momentum in pharma and biotech. Thanks for the questions. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. Matt Sykes : Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter Marc and Steve. Just my first question, Marc, when you announced the PPD acquisition last year, you said that part of the rationale was due to your large pharma customers wanting to reduce the number of trusted partnerships they had. And given that we are more than half a year on from the close of the deal and we are potentially facing a tougher economic environment where cost savings might become more important. Have you been able to capitalize on expanding these relationships? And could you share any specific examples of partnership expansions with large pharma as a result of the addition of the PPD business? Marc Casper : So, Matt, thanks for the question. One of the things that\u2019s just been phenomenal is the speed at which we have been able to get meaningful authorizations that clearly synergy work, meaning the benefits of bringing the combination together and we have had several of the larger clients that have worked historically, very closely with us, already select us to do business with them in clinical research. So, we have had meaningful wins there. We are also seeing some really interesting momentum in some of the smaller companies, well, so it\u2019s not just the large ones. But that concept of leveraging the existing relationships and the trusted partner status is working really well. And I think it was really cool that we were able to increase our synergy outlook by $100 million back in May, really just at that point was just six months after the close. I mean it\u2019s a big number. And the team is not stopping there. They are focused on closing business, building a very large authorizations backlog and growing the business incredibly strongly for the long-term. So, I think it\u2019s very positive. And we have earned a lot of trust over many years, and we are going to help our customers develop their medicines and do that cost effectively and rapidly so that they can really benefit patients. So, it\u2019s a very exciting time in terms of our clinical research momentum. Matt Sykes : Great. That\u2019s great to hear. Thanks. And then just one last question. Just any commentary on demand in the European region? Just give us some of the challenges your customers may be facing there. Have you seen any change in demand from customers across your business within Europe? Marc Casper : Yes. So, Matt, thanks for the question. So, Europe actually had a good quarter, right. And it\u2019s so to say that with down double digits. And effectively, we had a very significant COVID-19 testing comparison. So, embedded under that, the core business grew very strongly, actually. So, the demand has been good, and we saw really good market conditions in bioproduction, the research and safety market channel will be examples business did really well in Europe. So, what I saw in Q2 was strong. There is obviously lots of challenges in Europe. When we put that sentence, it\u2019s not a Thermo Fisher comment or an industry comment with pressures on energy prices and certainly, lots of challenges with the war in Ukraine. I think Europe will clearly be lumpy from a global economy perspective. But given our mix of business, which is very similar to the company average, we have a very large pharma biotech presence in Europe. And when you take out the COVID testing, it represents a little under 20% of our revenue. I think we will navigate that well. Matt Sykes : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel. You may proceed. Dan Arias : Good morning guys. Thank you. Stephen, maybe just back on the pricing topic. Marc Casper : Good morning. Dan Arias : Hey guys. How much of the pricing plan that you have for the year has been implemented at this point? Can we think about sort of a percentage of the portfolio where you have successfully pushed an increase through versus what might be left for the back half? Stephen Williamson : Yes, Dan, thanks for the question. So, we have been very active on pricing from midway through last year. So, it\u2019s not just a this year thing. And we are being appropriately adjusting as we have seeing the impacts of inflation change. And as Marc mentioned before, it\u2019s kind of how do you bring our customers with us at the same time. So, we are pricing appropriately, given the economic challenges that are around and I think appropriately navigating. So, I think about that, we are going to be dynamic as we go forward. So, we will figure out what the markets look like, what the inflation looks like and adjust appropriately as we think about the second half of this year and then going into 2023. So, it\u2019s kind of a constant work in process is the way I view it. The teams have actually done a very good job so far, and we will continue to navigate that way. Dan Arias : Okay. I appreciate that. Just as a follow-up, maybe, Marc, on your follow-up to Jack\u2019s question on sort of the end market pie chart. How does the \u2013 I am curious how the Applied Science business looks for you at this point? And would you draw any distinction between the growth that you are seeing or that you think you will see for industrial versus Applied, just knowing that those two tend to get lumped together a lot. I mean do you think decoupling those do is a useful thing in all to do? Marc Casper : Again, in terms of the industrial and Applied, we obviously continue to see good momentum. We have a good position in serving semiconductor materials science. Those are \u2013 have been strong. The Applied markets funding has been fine. So, that sector continues to be good. There is obviously global macroeconomic concerns, but generally, things continue to be strong. And we do have a different mix than we were much smaller in terms of the percentage of the total is so a different mix. We have more raw material science mix than we did back in the last recession. Dan Arias : Yes. Okay. Marc Casper : Thanks Dan. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Securities. You may proceed. Marc Casper : Puneet, good morning. Puneet Souda : Hi Stephen and Marc. Thanks Marc and congrats on the quarter. Just two brief questions for me. First one on analytical technologies, that was obviously very strong in the quarter, 13% growth. I think in last quarter, you did 12%. You pointed to a strong backlog going into the quarter as well. So, just wondering sort of how sustainable is that into the second half, given that these are instruments and not sort of consumables and services that you have highlighted as being a larger part of the business. But \u2013 and anything on the analytical instruments you could share on this strength of maybe potentially continuing into 2023, given the backlog or not would be really helpful. Marc Casper : So, Puneet, we had very strong performance in the quarter. Bookings were very strong as well. So, that gives us \u2013 that\u2019s encouraging in the second half. We also have a very large backlog, right. So, that also gives us some visibility to the second half as well, it gives us the confidence in the very strong outlook we have for the year from a core perspective. So, the signs are very good. And we are launching some amazing technology. That makes a huge difference. Like ASMS this year, I give obviously a deeper dive than normal, really affecting the workflow across a number of key applications for mass spectrometry, fantastic in terms of the feedback and momentum in the business. The same thing is true in our electron microscopy business is very strong. So, I think we are very well positioned going forward there. Puneet Souda : Got it. Okay. And then, Marc, a high-level question for you, a bigger important question we get from sort of investors around capacity expansion. I mean Thermo has expanded capacity across multiple business lines and across PPD as well as single-use sites and agreement with Moderna and such. Are these sites in production capacity sort of fully operational sort of in 2022 timeframe and delivering to the level that you expect them to deliver, or this is more of a 2023 or 2024 timeframe when you see them coming fully online, because obviously it requires hiring of folks and getting the full facility fully ramped up. So, asking that because we get questions around capacity expansion and lower capacity. But on the flip side, when I look at it, I mean this will generate meaningfully higher revenue for you when the capacity comes online fully. So, just wondering how to think about that in like the 11% guide that you have today and the 7% to 9% longer term? Thank you. Marc Casper : Puneet, thanks for the question. So, we picked a couple of really specific examples this quarter to highlight. I picked the example of Grand Island and Geel. And those capacity expansions or demand has been so strong for so long that we need to expand our capacity just to be able to support our future growth, right. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a different type of example, which is you deliver great results year-in, year-out, at some point, you expand your network to facilitate the gross strategy. Other of the expansions have a little more just adding new capabilities. They have been coming online this year and will continue to come online next year. So, it\u2019s a mix. And it\u2019s exciting in terms of in \u2013 we have really \u2013 we brought on new capacity in our self to finish. That was really the enabling the Moderna relationship expansion outside of COVID and that\u2019s really a 2023 example. And we have a number of other examples like single-use technology that we will be bringing online and we will continue to bring them on. So, it\u2019s a mix, but we feel good about the blend of investments and how they will fuel our growth strategy going forward. Rafael Tejada : Great. Thanks Puneet. Operator, we will take one more question. Operator : Absolutely. The next question and final question comes from the line of Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Tejas Savant : Hi guys. Thanks for the time. Maybe I will sneak in a two-parter here at the end. Beyond just the translational headwind from FX, Marc, do you see any signs that the strength of the dollar is beginning to weigh on customer minds, specifically in Europe and Japan? And then, Stephen, on the quarter-over-quarter sort of dip in gross margins roughly about 430 bps or so. Can you just help parse out what that bridge looks like between the COVID wind down versus FX versus other dynamics? Thank you. Marc Casper : So, on the FX and customer impact, the movements have been very rapid and relatively recently. So, there hasn\u2019t been a lot of customer discussion, it\u2019s really about where the rate is going to settle. And it\u2019s also going to depend a lot on what the alternatives are. If everybody is a U.S. based cost company, then it is what it is. If you have different where are we producing, where others producing and get into some of those dynamics. So far, it\u2019s been a non-issue. And we have dealt with this. The fact that I pulled out a playbook from what we had in the years past where we had rapid moves in the rates and we know how to navigate that environment a lot. Steve? Stephen Williamson : Yes. So, on the gross margin, the gross margin came in exactly where I thought it would, so kind of in line with our expectations. I think that on a year-over-year basis, I think a lot of people are missing the impact of PPD. It\u2019s just under a 400 basis point impact on margin profile. And the rest really since the change both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year related to the mix in business in terms of testing versus other core and an element of pricing to offset inflation that also puts a little bit of pressure on margins so the other piece to it. Marc Casper : Great. Thanks Tejas. Tejas Savant : Thanks Steve. Marc Casper : Let me wrap up. So, as you have heard this morning, really an excellent first half of the year. We are on track to deliver another outstanding year with great momentum and that sets us up for a very bright future. As always, thank you for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks everyone. Operator : That concludes the conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

So with that, I will now turn over the call to Marc. Marc Casper : Thanks, Raf. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we had another excellent quarter. We delivered outstanding financial performance. Our core business is performing incredibly well and demonstrating broad-based strength and this is allowing us to raise our guidance once again for the full year. As I reflect on our performance during the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, I am very proud of our team\u2019s great execution, effectively navigating dynamic times and continuing to drive market share gains. Our ongoing success is driven by our proven growth strategy and our PPI Business System and I will talk about that more later. So let me recap the Q3 financials. Our revenue in the quarter was $10.68 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.37 billion and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.08 per share. Turning to our end markets, as we saw in the second quarter, we had a continuation of strong performance in Q3. This was driven by good market conditions and outstanding execution from our global team, resulting in meaningful share gain. Let me now give you some additional color. Starting with pharma and biotech, we delivered outstanding performance with growth in the mid-teens. We saw excellent growth across the businesses serving these customers, highlighted by our bioproduction and pharma services businesses. Our differentiated customer value proposition is resonating with our customers and helping to further elevate our trusted partner status. In academic and government, we grew in the mid single-digits in the quarter. We saw strong growth in our biosciences and electron microscopy businesses. Turning to industrial and applied, we grew in the high-teens for the quarter. We have broad-based strength across all of our analytical instrument businesses serving these customers. And finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, as expected, our revenue was approximately 30% lower than the prior year quarter. In this end market, we delivered good core business growth led by our microbiology and transplant diagnostics businesses. So now let me turn to our growth strategy, which has enabled another quarter of excellent performance. The investments we have made over the past few years are fueling growth and generating strong returns. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars : developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in the high-growth and emerging markets, and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Let me start with innovation. Our focus on high-impact innovation enables our customers to address some of the world\u2019s greatest challenges. We further strengthened our position in Q3 and I\u2019d like to give you just a few highlights. During the quarter, we advanced our industry-leading Thermo Scientific Orbitrap portfolio, launching the Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid mass spectrometer during the International Mass Spectrometry Conference. This instrument provides faster, more sensitive sample analysis for proteomics and metabolomics research and insights into clinically relevant biomarkers implicated in cancer. In electron microscopy, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Arctis Cryo-Plasma Focused Ion Beam, an automated microscope that streamlines cryoelectron tomography. This instrument will help provide more insights into how proteins and other molecules operate within cells, enabling breakthroughs in treatments for infectious diseases and neurogenerative disorders. We also continue to advance our clinical next-gen sequencing portfolio to help our customers better understand, diagnose and treat cancer. We recently launched the Oncomine Dx Express Test and Oncomine Reporter Dx software, a precision medicine offering which detects genomic abnormalities in tumor samples and helps match cancer patients with approved therapies and clinical trials. These products recently received CE-IVD certification and are designed to run on our Ion Torrent Genexus next-generation sequencing system, allowing doctors to use NGS technology to improve care by bringing the power of precision medicine closer to patients. Another key pillar of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition. It\u2019s all about leveraging the incredible capabilities we have across our company and delivering them in a way that enables our customers to achieve their own goals for innovation and productivity and that makes it rational for them to do more business with us. The accelerated investments we have made over the past couple of years are driving growth. This is particularly true for our pharma and biotech customers, where we continue to build on our trusted partner status as we bring our new capacity and capabilities online to meet the strong demand for our products and services. Let me share a couple of examples. During the quarter, we opened a purification technologies facility in Chelmsford, Massachusetts. This site will manufacture resin beads used in the production of biologics. As you know, we have a rapidly growing purification business, which is highly valued by our customers. This new facility will ensure we can meet their increasing demand. We also continue to strengthen our global pharma services network, adding viral vector manufacturing capabilities in Plainville, Massachusetts. I joined the opening of this facility and it was a terrific event. We had significant attendance from our customers and we were able to showcase the various ways in which our team can support their cell and gene therapy programs. The facility also utilizes and showcases our industry-leading single-use bioprocessing technologies and analytical instruments, which demonstrates to our pharma and biotech customers the uniqueness of our capabilities and how they can best utilize in bringing new medicines to market. So, these are just a couple of examples that demonstrate how we are continuing to build our trusted partner status and further strengthen our unique customer value proposition. Our pharma biotech customers are capitalizing on this, which also includes PPD, our clinical research business. I will cover that later in my remarks. Before turning to an update on capital deployment, I thought I\u2019d briefly reflect on the impact of our growth strategy in 2022. As you know, the actions we have taken over the last 2 years have allowed us to meaningfully accelerate our organic growth and position us to continue our long-term industry leading performance. The product launches this year have been truly outstanding and the pipeline, it looks fantastic. The new capabilities that we have invested in have meaningfully strengthened our unique customer value proposition and our customers are continuing to expand their relationship with us. All of this is enabling us to deliver industry leading core growth. Let me give you a brief update on capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. The acquisition of PPD is a great example of how our capital deployment strategy is creating customer and shareholder value. The business is performing incredibly well, delivering high-teens core revenue growth in the quarter. The combination of a great business and a smooth integration is driving excellent financial performance. In addition, our customers are excited by the capabilities we have to support their clinical trial needs and that is translating into meaningful revenue synergies for an even brighter future. All of this is enabling us to drive short and long-term returns on the acquisition that are well ahead of the deal model. Let me spend a moment on our PPI Business System, which helps us continually improve the customer experience, quality, productivity in our company overall. The goal of PPI is to find a better way everyday. This is an essential element of our company culture. In dynamic times, we really see the strength of our PPI Business System. As you know, it was applied with incredible impact to allow us to lead the response to the pandemic. And today, it\u2019s applied to solve supply chain challenges, increase efficiency and helps our teams find better ways to offset inflation. It also enhances our ability to unlock the value creation in our acquisitions. Our experienced management team, along with the benefit of our scale and our PPI Business System, uniquely position the company to successfully navigate through whatever macroeconomic conditions come our way. So overall, it was another fantastic quarter, thanks to great execution by our teams, the strength of our proven growth strategy and the power of our PPI Business System. Turning to our progress on our environmental, social and governance priorities. During the quarter, we continued to make great progress on our goal to reduce our carbon footprint, announcing an agreement with Enel North America to purchase wind power renewable electricity equal to half of our U.S. electricity needs. This agreement will significantly advance our ambitious emissions reduction strategy. I am also very pleased that we have achieved our 2020 commitment to hire 500 graduates from the historically black colleges and universities, supporting our commitment to diversity and inclusion and increasing our positive social impact, so another strong quarter in progressing our ESG priorities. Now, I\u2019d like to review our updated 2022 guidance at a high level and then Steve will take you through the details. We are raising our full year guidance. We are increasing our revenue guidance by $650 million to $43.8 billion, which would result in 12% reported revenue growth over 2021. And we are raising our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.08 to $23.01 per share. The higher outlook primarily reflects the strength of our core business and a modest impact of additional COVID-19 testing. These are more than offsetting the increased foreign exchange headwinds and demonstrate how well we are operating with speed at scale to enable our customer success. In addition, our guidance reflects the decision to help our colleagues with the temporary impact of inflation. We will be making a one-time payment of approximately one week\u2019s additional salary to non-executive colleagues. So to summarize our key takeaways in the third quarter, our outstanding results in Q3 and year-to-date reflect our team\u2019s excellent execution, the benefits of our proven growth strategy and the positive impact of our PPI Business System. Our business is performing very well and markets continue to be strong. We are gaining market share. We are seeing the benefits of our accelerated investments in innovative new products and enhanced capabilities and capacity. In addition, our clinical research business has delivered excellent results and customers are valuing the benefit of our expanded offering. And our experienced management team, the benefits of our scale and our PPI Business System uniquely position us to continue to navigate the dynamic times we are living in. All of this has enabled us to raise our outlook for 2022 again and further solidify our incredibly bright future. With that, I will now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc and good morning everyone. We delivered another excellent quarter in Q3. This includes 14% core organic revenue growth from $5.08 of adjusted earnings per share. Revenue in Q3 was approximately $800 million higher than we had incorporated in our previous 2022 guidance with just over $600 million driven by another quarter of extremely strong core organic growth, just over $200 million from additional COVID-19 testing revenue, partially offset by a small additional headwind from FX. So continue strengthening the core once again broad-based across businesses and end markets. In terms of adjusted EPS, our PPI Business System enabled us to generate very strong pull-through on the revenue beat. And after accruing $0.18 of additional compensation in the quarter to help our colleagues with the temporary impacts of inflation, we delivered $0.36 of adjusted EPS higher than included in our previous guidance. So Q3 was another quarter of excellent financial performance. Let me now provide you with some more details. Beginning with our earnings results and as I mentioned, we delivered $5.08 of adjusted EPS in Q3. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $3.79. On the top line in Q3, we delivered 14% core organic revenue growth and $440 million of testing revenue. Reported revenue grew 14% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue increase included 1% lower organic revenue, a 20% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 5% from foreign exchange. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, the organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in the current and prior year. In Q3, North America grew in the low single-digits. Europe declined 10%. Asia-Pacific grew in the low single-digits with China growing high single-digits and rest of the world declined high single-digits. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 15% and adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, 760 basis points lower than Q3 last year. In the quarter, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation while also driving strong productivity. This is more than offset by lower testing volumes, continued strategic investments and the expected impact of incorporating PPD into our financials. The company\u2019s adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.7%, 970 basis points lower than Q3 last year. For the third quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. After factoring in the decision we took to accrue the additional colleague compensation that I mentioned earlier, both adjusted operating margin and adjusted gross margin came in as we had anticipated in our prior guidance. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.2% of revenue, a decrease of 170 basis points versus Q3 2021. Total R&D expense was approximately $350 million in Q3, and R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q3 was 6.7%. Looking at results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $106 million. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 11.8%. This was 240 basis points lower than Q3 last year. The Q3 rate was 75 basis points lower than we assumed in the quarter in the prior guide due to the timing of discrete tax planning items between Q3 and Q4 with no net change for the year overall. Average diluted shares were 395 million in Q3, approximately 2 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases and option dilution. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $5.7 billion, and free cash flow was $4 billion. Our capacity and capability investments continue to progress well and the year-to-date net capital expenditures were $1.7 billion. We returned $118 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This reflects the 15% dividend increase we announced in February. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion in cash and $29.2 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.3x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.1x on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 15.2%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we are generating across the company. Now I will provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varies by segment. And the testing revenue was significantly higher than the prior year quarter but does skew some of the reported segment margins. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re executing strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. And we outlined at the beginning of the year, we\u2019re referring to the acquired PPD business as our clinical research business, and that resides in the laboratory products and biopharma services segment. So moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q3 reported revenue in this segment declined 20%, and organic revenue was 17% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q3, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction business. This was more than offset by the moderation in testing revenue in the segment versus the prior year quarter. Q3 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions decreased 43%. And adjusted operating margin was 35.1%, down 14 percentage points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered good productivity, which was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and the strategic investments that we\u2019re making across the segment. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 10% in Q3, and organic growth was 16%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was broad-based led by chromatography and mass spectrometry and electron microscopy businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income in this segment increased 47%, and adjusted operating margin was 23.8%, up 600 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull-through, favorable business mix and strong productivity. This was partially offset by strategic investments. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q3, reported revenue declined 22%, and organic revenue was 19% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q3, we saw a strong underlying growth in our transplant diagnostics and microbiology businesses. This is offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year-ago quarter. Q3 adjusted operating income decreased 29% in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 21%, down 210 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, we delivered positive business mix and good productivity, which is more than offset by the impact of lower testing volumes. Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. In Q3, reported revenue increased 60%. Organic growth was 12%, and the impact of acquisitions was 53%. During Q3, we had strong growth in the Pharma Services business as well as the research and safety market channel. PPD, our clinical research business, is performing very well. And during the quarter, we delivered high teens core organic growth and contributed $1.82 billion of revenue to the segment. Q3 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 89%, and adjusted operating margin was 13%, which is 200 basis points higher than Q3 2021. In the quarter, we drove favorable business mix, good productivity and also saw the benefit from acquisitions. This was partially offset by strategic investments. Let me now turn to our updated 2022 guidance. As Marc outlined, we\u2019re raising our full year revenue guidance by $650 million to $43.8 billion. This includes a raise in the core organic growth outlook for the year from 11% to 12%. And on the bottom line, we\u2019re raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2022 by $0.08 to $23.01 per share. The increase in the revenue guidance is driven by three elements : an increase of just over $600 million in the outlook for the core business, an increase of just over $200 million for COVID-19 testing revenue and a $200 million decrease to reflect the recent changes in FX rates. From a core organic revenue perspective, the strength of our performance is enabling us to raise our full year core organic revenue growth outlook from 11% to 12%, and there is no change in the assumptions for core organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Turning to COVID-19 testing revenue. We now expect $2.8 billion of testing revenue for the year, which includes the assumption of an endemic run rate level of $100 million per quarter in Q4. Our Q4 testing assumption has not changed from our previous guidance. In terms of adjusted EPS, the $0.08 raise for the year consists of $0.54 of operational beat in Q3, partially offset by the decision to pay $180 million or $0.36 of additional one-time colleague compensation. And half of this is accrued in Q3, and the remainder will be in Q4. The full year guidance change also incorporates $0.10 lower EPS in Q4 for the additional FX headwind in the quarter and the revised phasing of our tax rate. All of this is enabling us to raise the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.08 from $22.93 to $23.01, further improving a very strong outlook for the year. From a margin standpoint, we now expect the full year 2022 adjusted operating margin to be 24.9%. To help you with your modeling, I think it\u2019s worth spending a moment on the impact of the inflationary environment on the company\u2019s financial profile. During the year, we\u2019ve been very effective in passing on higher price to offset higher-than-normal inflation. This results in no net impact on our adjusted operating income dollars as we\u2019re effectively offsetting the added inflation, but it does affect the calculation of margins because of the revenue base being higher. The impact on margins for the full year from this dynamic is about 60 basis points, but again, no net impact on adjusted operating income or adjusted EPS. So now let me provide you with some additional details on the updated 2022 guidance. PPD, our clinical research business, is expected to deliver $6.8 billion of revenue in 2022, which represents 14% core organic revenue growth on a full year basis for this business. We now expect the business to contribute $2.03 to adjusted EPS in the year, up $0.03 from our prior guidance. In terms of FX, we\u2019ve incorporated current rates into our guidance, and we now expect FX to be a year-over-year headwind of $1.46 billion on revenue or 3.7%. The FX headwind on adjusted EPS in 2022 is now expected to be $0.77 for the full year or 3.1%. Should FX rates stay the same as they are right now, we estimate the impact on FX in 2023 would be a year-over-year headwind of approximately $1 billion on revenue and $0.75 on adjusted EPS. Our guidance now assumes net interest expense of approximately $440 million in 2022. We continue to assume an adjusted income tax rate of 13.2% in 2022, which includes a 13.6% tax rate in Q4. We now expect net capital expenditures of approximately $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. For free cash flow, we see $7 billion at the high end of the range of outcomes for the year. The actual free cash flow will depend on the year-end level of working capital. Our guidance still assumes $2.5 billion of capital deployment, which is the $2 billion of share buybacks that we completed in January and $475 million of capital returned to shareholders through dividends. Our guidance also continues to assume the full year average diluted share count will be between 394 million and 395 million shares. And to conclude, we delivered another excellent quarter in Q3. We\u2019re in a great position to achieve our 2022 goals. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Raf. Rafael Tejada : Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack, please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. So the big debate of the last week has been bioprocessing ordering and stocking trends. Marc, I was curious if you\u2019ve seen any normalization of ordering patterns from your customers. The quarterly growth, obviously strong, but how do you handicap the risk we could have an air pocket as COVID gets handed off to the quarter? Marc Casper : Jack, thanks for the question. So probably best to start one level up, and then I\u2019ll get to the details of it, right? When I think about pharma and biotech more broadly, right, it\u2019s our largest end market, represents about 60% of our business performing incredibly well, right? Mid-teens growth this quarter, mid-teens growth year-to-date. And that growth number actually doesn\u2019t include PPD, right, which is actually growing in the quarter, grew faster, right? So very strong, it\u2019s broad-based. Customer demand continues to be strong across the portfolio. All our businesses are performing very nicely. The long-term trends look very positive. And when I think back and I think because we live in a moment, if you go back the last 5 years, it actually averaged for this whole segment mid-teens growth, right? So it\u2019s not this year or this quarter. It\u2019s really been a long-term trend long before COVID, right? So very, very strong. Now so what\u2019s going on in bioproduction, right? There is obviously been a lot of commentary over the last week on the topic. And as a reminder, we have a leading presence to cell culture media, single-use technologies and actually quite a rapidly growing purification business. In aggregate, it\u2019s less than 10% of our total revenue. It\u2019s an awesome business, right? They performed very well in the quarter. It grew faster than the pharma and biotech average. The dynamics are very good, and we\u2019re very well positioned to deliver great growth going forward in serving our customer base. Jack Meehan : Great. And then if you\u2019ll humor me, it\u2019s that time of year, everyone is thinking about 2023. So you sound very confident about your ability to outperform the market. But of course, the question is, how do you feel like the market is going to grow? So if you could just talk about how you\u2019re feeling about the healthy end markets. And any color you care to share around where you think you could land versus the 7% to 9% CAGR you\u2019ve laid out through 2025? Marc Casper : What I would say is if I think about where we are and think about the third quarter, right, it was a terrific quarter. If you look at the strength, right, that we had in terms of our core growth it\u2019s really broad-based, right? And you look at it and you say, alright, pharma and biotech that grew in the mid-teens. Industrial and applied, that grew in the high teens. Academic and government grew in the mid-single digits. And the core in healthcare and diagnostics, which is the indicator of what\u2019s going on in that end market, that actually was a mid-single-digit growth as well. So it\u2019s really very strong. So I like where we are at the 9 months. And in terms of exactly how we will be in \u201823, we will obviously talk about that in January in terms of what the outlook is. But certainly, at this point in the year, our end markets are strong, and our company\u2019s performance has been exceptional. Jack Meehan : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Derik, please go ahead. Derik De Bruin : Hi, good morning. Marc Casper : Good morning, Derik. Derik De Bruin : So to follow-up on Jack\u2019s question just because I\u2019m getting yelled at by investors. Can you talk a little bit more about the \u2013 just some of the impressions on \u201823? I think particularly, they just focus on margins, given how \u2013 sort of given how FX trends are going. I mean, it looks like, what, about a 4% FX to the top line next year and $0.75 on the bottom line. So is that \u2013 sort of should we think about if you\u2019re thinking about that 7% to 9%, maybe sort of in the 3%, 4% organic range all in next year, given the FX headwinds? And then just sort of talk a little bit more about like the margin setup for next year? Marc Casper : So I\u2019ll start, and I\u2019m sure Stephen will chime in as well. So obviously, at a high level, we will get into this in January, right? Why do we do January is we will have the benefit of two things, which is where was the exact finish to the year, what\u2019s our jumping-off point? And second, what is the most close in view of the macro environment, right? So we will see how that plays out in January. But \u2013 excuse me. So if I go through the components, right? Obviously, the company is performing at an incredibly strong level. So that was very encouraging. As Stephen outlined, it will be a headwind that could change, obviously. But right now, we gave you that number so that you can at least update the models to reflect what current FX range rates are. And that\u2019s about $1 billion of revenue headwind and about $0.75 of adjusted EPS. The second one that I think is important, and it\u2019s an assumption, which is we\u2019re assuming in the fourth quarter that we\u2019re at an endemic level of COVID-19 testing. So that\u2019s $100 million of revenue in the quarter. And if that plays out in that way, then I think that\u2019s a reasonable assumption per quarter for next year. So you\u2019re going to have the view on the COVID runoff down to the endemic rate on testing. And from the rest of the perspective, the business is in really good shape. And Stephen, you can comment on margins or anything else that I might have missed. Stephen Williamson : Yes. So Derik, we look forward to giving you full details in 3 months\u2019 time in terms of the Q4 call. But think about the margin profile, there are different elements of the revenue, and think about how we model it in the long-term model for the company. 50 basis points of expansion on core essentially equates to about 30% pull-through on the margin profile and the revenue dollars increasing from a core standpoint. The FX headwind that we outlined on the call, that\u2019s also roughly a 30% margin pull-through. And on testing, it\u2019s a very profitable element of our business. And we factor in appropriately addressing the variable costs and the non-repeat of some of the colleague compensation one-time that we did this year. That pull-through on testing is \u2013 no, just 10% margin higher than the core. So, that will help you with modeling in terms around your own assumptions around the organic growth and testing and FX. And as I said, that\u2019s all incorporated in the long-term model. And then on the call, I called out that 60 basis points impact from the \u2013 added impact of added inflation and what we\u2019re doing on pricing and managing the company well to offset the impacts of the added inflation as more revenue to the company and negate the impact of the additional inflation. So, no net impact on operating income dollars. So when I think about all of that wrapped up for our long-term financial model we gave you back in May, we\u2019re on track to achieve or exceed the adjusted EPS target we put at that. We\u2019re managing very well through the dynamic times. Look forward to giving more details in \u201823 on the next call. Derik De Bruin : Got it. Okay. I\u2019m still getting a bunch of questions from investors, but we will follow-up with it. But two other questions, just on this one. I guess are you still seeing like for like the $1.5 billion in COVID vaccines for this year? And just obviously some of the semiconductor companies have been hitting their CapEx numbers or cutting their CapEx numbers. Does that have any sort of like impact on sort of like your view on FEI and the instrument outlook? Thank you. Marc Casper : Yes. So Derik, in terms of vaccines and therapies, as a reminder, we said we would expect to do in our core revenue about $1.5 billion this year. We did just under $400 million in Q3. That brings the year-to-date to $1.3 billion and on track to achieve or exceed the $1.5 billion. So I feel good about that. Our \u2013 as a reminder, on electron microscopy, it\u2019s not correlated to the CapEx spend. It\u2019s correlated to R&D and new nodes and that business is performing incredibly well in terms of growth, with bookings all of the different metrics really doing incredibly well. Thank you, Derik. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Marc, maybe one just kind of following up on that stocking piece, I know you\u2019ve previously talked about Thermo, you guys are involved in a lot of the purchasing decisions of customers, have employees in the room. And you had previously seen some repurposing of the vaccine orders for other trial work as expected. So just, I guess, wondering specifically on the bioprocessing side kind of what your visibility is there? What you are seeing on stocking, and at times you said, if anything, maybe the inventory is actually running lean because you guys were capacity constrained. So I\u2019m just wondering kind of an update on that front? Marc Casper : Yes. So Patrick, thanks for the question and a follow-up on that. So if I think about inventory, right, and I read some of the Q&A that happened last week. And somehow that translated into our own share price, which is a little bit of a head scratcher to me. If you think about inventory levels, right, I guess I always start at the high level. Three of our businesses, which are a large portion of the company, literally have nothing to do with inventory at all, right, which is pharma services, our clinical research business and our analytical instrument business has nothing to do with inventory. So I think it\u2019s important to remember that. The second, when you get down to the businesses that do have inventory levels, some of which we hold, some of which our customers hold, we do have really good visibility into it. And we help our customers appropriately manage those levels of inventory. I feel good about the position that we\u2019re in, alright? And for the couple of customers that might have COVID-related things, I\u2019m sure that they purchased a bit more because they had a high range of demand volatility that they were managing. But in terms of our bioproduction business, it grew well faster than pharma and biotech. The outlook is really strong, and I feel very well positioned going forward. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Stephen, I know you talked a little bit about the pricing dynamic kind of offsetting the inflation this year. It\u2019s obviously been a higher number, as you all know. How are you thinking about the \u201823 piece on pricing? Again, what\u2019s the expectation internally from Thermo on the inflation side? How are you going to kind of play the pricing side? Are you going to continue to raise as much? Is there a level where you kind of pull back a little bit and kind of value the customer relationships more? Maybe just talk through again the pricing piece. I know it\u2019s a little bit delicate with how high the inflation side is. So, be curious how you guys are thinking about that into next year. Thank you. Stephen Williamson : Yes. So, have a better view on inflation three months\u2019 time, but we are effectively managing the dynamics now and expect to effectively manage them going forward. And this has been about pricing just if you can in an inflation environment. It\u2019s pricing appropriately, given the inflation dynamics and then bringing our customers along with us on that journey. So, I feel good about our ability to manage the dynamic going forward should the inflation levels remain at the elevated level. Marc Casper : And Patrick, the only thing I would add to that is when you think about how we describe the approach, right, we are not marking it up, right. We are driving substantial productivity. We are passing through an appropriate level of pricing to reflect real cost increase, and we are helping our customers through this period of time. And that\u2019s how we thought about it. And we think that\u2019s the right thing, given the importance of Thermo Fisher to our customers. And we will do an appropriate level of pricing based on the environment in \u201823 as we get into. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on solid top line this morning. Marc, one on fiscal \u201823 again, I know the guidance, the formal guidance is in January. But I guess the question is, the 7% to 9% LRP that Thermo issued at the Analyst Day, that\u2019s a CAGR. But there has been some nervousness that perhaps \u201823 could be below that range. I mean the macro is the macro. But ex macro in industrial, is there any sensitivity around these major drivers that would cause big deviation from the LRP range for \u201823 that we should be thinking about? Again, I am not asking for formal guidance, but any variables, qualitative comments we should be looking at? Marc Casper : So, Vijay, thanks for the question. So, when I think about how do we think about growth, right, is 7% to 9%. And if you take the long-term model, right. So, I am not commenting on \u201823. I don\u2019t make a comment there. But that\u2019s industry-leading, right. I think folks forget that. That\u2019s \u2013 that number is higher than anybody else has committed to in the industry. So, I feel great about that. And of course, we are the biggest company, so which makes it super cool, right, in terms of what that says about share gain, right. So, I think that sometimes is forgotten. We are not constraining ourselves to 7% to 9%, right. We are growing 12% this year, right. And the measure that we actually use is, are we doing a good job, right. I mean the 7% to 9% is assuming 4% to 6% market growth over the long period. The market growth is a little better than that. I feel great about our 12% performance. When we sit here at the end of 2022, what we do know is that our business will have been larger as a starting off point than what we assumed in the long-term model. So, right there, we have had more core growth that will offset some of the transition from vaccines and therapies that move into the other parts of core. So, we are super well positioned. And we will figure out is 7% to 9% the right number. That\u2019s kind of our default unless something is radically different as a starting point to a year. And obviously, if the conditions are super robust, it could be higher than that. If we are in a gale-force recession, it could be lower than that, right. But I think at this point in the year, the long-term is we are doing better on the top line. We are right on track on EPS and we are incredibly well positioned into 2023, and we will figure it out. And I don\u2019t think we are going to surprise anybody, right. We will all look at the macro and say, yes, those numbers make a ton of sense based on what the environment is as we sit here in January. And once again, we will be ambitious, and we will deliver great performance. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful, Marc. Maybe one for Stephen here, on the impact from additional comp, and I understand there is some flow-through in Q4. Stephen, when you think about \u201823, are you planning for any comp, incremental comp expenses to offset inflation for employees? Is that something that we should be considering? Stephen Williamson : No, I think the dynamics that I outlined earlier on is going to pull through. The assumption there is that don\u2019t repeat. We will figure out what the current situation is during the year and make the right calls and manage the company appropriately. But when I think about that pull-through on the testing, that includes the non-repeat on those actions as well. Vijay Kumar : Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Brennan with Cowen. Please go ahead. Dan, your line is open. Dan Brennan : Great. Thank you and thanks for taking the questions. Marc, I don\u2019t want to jinx for jet, so I am going to refrain from making any comments or claims here. Maybe Marc and Steve, could you just walk us around the globe and your key end markets? I mean just speak to what extent you are seeing any impacts from the weakening global economy. And if nothing really manifest in Q3, which doesn\u2019t look like it has, are there any lead indicators like orders funnels, anything of that nature that might reflect some softening? Just \u2013 and then kind of connected to that, the fourth quarter guide does reflect a notable slowing on a stack comp basis. And so I am wondering if that\u2019s just conservatism or if that does incorporate some maybe risk from global macro? Marc Casper : So, in terms of the macroeconomic environment, beyond the inflationary impacts, which we had explained, actually, our end markets have been very strong. As you know, I gave you the cut by the four kind of customer sets, actually geographically, no particular pattern that jumps out as a concern. When you look at Europe, the core growth actually was 10% growth. So, Europe was actually strong. And it makes sense because you have a large pharma and biotech proportion of that. So, that was good. And our assumption is that in China, which will have a very good year and a good quarter, it\u2019s probably slightly lower than the long-term historical view. And that\u2019s mostly the COVID policies there. So, we are always looking for is there something lurking, but right now, things remain strong. Fourth quarter, it\u2019s the same assumptions that we have been using all year, which is we haven\u2019t been adjusting our forward-looking quarters. We basically took the original quarters. And as we delivered a strong quarter, we raised the full year based on what we delivered and have kept the convention for the upcoming quarters the same as what we had done in the past. That implies growth in line with the long-term organic outlook for the business. And obviously, we will deliver the strongest possible growth that we can. We will just see how the quarter plays out. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks for that. And then maybe just as a follow-up, just on instruments. Instrument demand at Thermo across the group has been kind of very strong for a period of time. AI had another good quarter. Just wondering kind of what you are seeing on that front, and kind of what do you think about as you look ahead. While I am not guiding for \u201823, kind of is the instrument underlying strength sustainable? Just any color macro-wise and company-specific initiatives. Thanks. Marc Casper : Yes. Thanks for the question. And the instruments business is performing really well, continuing the trend. It\u2019s great to have the growth rates that we delivered in terms of mid-teens organic growth in the quarter and which is terrific. Bookings were very strong. So, the outlook remains very good. Very impressed with how our chromatography and mass spectrometry business did. It\u2019s our fastest-growing business in the quarter and great growth in our electron microscopy and really good performance in chemical analysis. So, actually, the business strength is widespread and broad-based. So, it looks very good as we are finishing up the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Rachel. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. Thanks for taking the question. And so first up, on the manufacturing side, you have had a few peers that have had some quality concerns in recent quarters around that sterile fill and finish market. So, can you just walk us through how that business performed for you in 3Q? And then do you think this really opens up any opportunity for share gains moving forward? Marc Casper : So, Rachel, thanks for the question. When I think about our pharma services business, it was one of the highlights for performance in the quarter. It\u2019s been a good growth driver for the company. Customers are driving towards more outsourcing. The smaller companies have less manufacturing and development capabilities in-house. So, the secular trends here are fantastic. We have an industry-leading position. We have been investing in new capabilities, strengthening quality systems, capacity, infrastructure, all of those things to position it well. And it\u2019s our job to do great work every day for our customers and focused on doing that really well. And that\u2019s what we are focused on, and it\u2019s important that we do it. And we want to grow at a reasonable rate and just make sure that we are doing great work every day for our customers. Rachel Vatnsdal : Thanks. And then as a follow-up to Dan\u2019s question, just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into Europe. So, you mentioned that, that region was down 10% in the quarter, but you flagged that it was also impacted by that COVID testing comp. So, can you walk us through how much of that 10% decline was due to FX and COVID roll off? And then are you seeing any shift in demand within that region just given the macro uncertainty there? Thanks. Stephen Williamson : Yes. So, in terms of the core growth in Europe, it\u2019s about 10%, excluding FX, excluding the testing side of things as well. So, good strong growth across the region. And as Marc said, it\u2019s a good concentration in pharma and biotech in the region, which is a strong growth business for us. So, yes, around about 10% in Europe. Great. Thanks Rachel. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel. Please go ahead, Dan. Dan Arias : Good morning guys. Thanks. Marc, on the bioproduction capacity expansion that you have been working on, the $600 million plus that you outlined there as a build out, I am just wondering, as we head towards December if you might be able to sort of give a refreshed view on just how much of that will be \u2013 or do you think will be open to start the year versus what might be slated for \u201823? And then how you are feeling about filling out that capacity, just given what we are seeing in terms of end market demand and activity there? Marc Casper : Yes. So, Dan, thanks for the question. So, as a reminder, back in early 2021, we outlined our goals for expanding our capacity to meet the really strong long-term growth trends in our pharma services and our bioproduction businesses. And really, what we did is we looked at our 5-year roadmap of what we were planning to bring forward, and we pulled some of those things forward. In bioproduction, we made three specific investment decisions, some expansion of our single-use technology network. We opened a facility, a second facility in Utah. We opened up a facility in Tennessee. Both of those are operational. We expanded our Grand Island, New York cell culture media facility, that\u2019s also largely complete. And we just opened our purification facility in Massachusetts, which is our second purification facility. So, we are largely complete with the investments in bioproduction. But we are not operating at full capacity of that. We are not operating full shift seven days a week in the new facilities. We are rather going through the thoughtful ramp up. And that will continue to ramp up through 2023 and even into 2024 to bring it to kind of more of the full utilization. We feel very good about the demand environment. So, that capacity is bringing lead times back to more normal pre-pandemic levels, which is terrific. And that will position us really well for share gain. When I think about purification, which I think is worth a moment on, we were literally capacity constrained. We had demand that was so strong that we weren\u2019t able to bring on a lot of new business over the last few months. And it\u2019s great to have Johnsonville [ph] online because that allow us to continue to support the growth of new molecules and our customers. So, that\u2019s a quick recap on that. Dan Arias : Okay. Helpful. And then just maybe on PPD, it sounds like things continue to go well there. And to the point of a couple of guys here, there is naturally a focus on 2023. You will have a tough comp there, actually like 2 years of tough comps there. So, anything that you might be able to add on just how you see PPD growth tracking going forward? Marc Casper : Yes. So, our clinical research business, right, it serves an attractive end market within pharma and biotech, again, similar in a way to our pharma services business, more the innovations coming from the smaller companies. That really lends well to partnering with a clinical research organization. Our business is growing at a very high level. As Stephen highlighted, we are expecting 14% growth assumed in our guidance for the year, which is very strong. And what I am really excited about is the reaction from customers. I have seen quite a few customers in the third quarter and really had the opportunity to discuss what we are doing in clinical research services. And feedback is exciting. Our revenue synergies are very strong. They don\u2019t show up in the revenue to-date. They show up in the authorization for the future. And which is why I was able to really highlight that the business is not only ahead of the short-term deal model, but the projection is it will be well ahead over the long-term deal model. And we are excited about the momentum we will carry with that business going into 2023. Rafael Tejada : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today comes from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Tejas. Your line is open. Tejas Savant : Thank you. Marc and Stephen, good morning. One follow-up for me on Europe, Marc. I mean energy costs are clearly in focus you are heading into the winter. Can you just help us dimension your cost on the energy side as a percent of your regional sales? And any kind of like resiliency plans that you have put in place? And then as a quick follow-up there, any color on research funding trends in Europe, particularly as government priorities might be shifting here a little bit? Marc Casper : Yes. So, one of the powers of our PPI Business System and the benefits of our scale is to be able navigate the supply chain challenges that have existed in the world. And I would put energy availability as a potential challenge in Europe as we get into the winter. So, we went site-by-site and looked at what is the source of energy and made appropriate adjustments. So, a number of sites, we moved off of natural gas or there was a situation where the government said that we are going to be supplied. It\u2019s different scenarios depending on which country, what site, what purpose. So, I feel like we are well positioned to navigate that environment. In terms of research funding, it seems good. I mean obviously, the next level of European funding is being considered this month and at least what the public discussion is positive about the funding environment there. In terms of energy costs\u2026 Stephen Williamson : Yes. In terms of the energy cost, this is not material. What\u2019s material is make sure you are managing the ability to stay open the supply chain and looking into your customers. So, that\u2019s where we are spending our time and effort. And we switch the energy type. And it\u2019s about staying open and meeting that to our customers to support them through this. Tejas Savant : Got it. And just one quick follow-up on PPD, if I may. One of your CRO peers, Marc, just mentioned investigator staff shortages at some sites, causing trial delays, not broad-based, but in some cases. Just curious what you are seeing in terms of labor market tightness there? And do you expect sort of wage inflation in specific to PPD to be a factor we should be thinking about into next year as well? Marc Casper : Business performed great. We obviously had 18% growth in the quarter, 14% growth outlook for the year. The way wage inflation works in that business is it gets passed through in the normal course pricing in the contract, so that you could have a quarter or something lag. But effectively, if there is unusual wage inflation that this gets passed through to the customer base. So, I don\u2019t see any particular significant challenge there. So, let me wrap it up here. As you heard this morning, another excellent quarter, we are on track to deliver an outstanding year, and that\u2019s going to set us up for a very bright future. And as always, thanks for your ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we turn into 2023. Thanks everyone. End of Q&A: Operator : Thank you everyone for joining us today. This concludes our call and you may now disconnect your lines.",

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call and a wrap-up of a truly exceptional year for Thermo Fisher Scientific. We delivered another quarter of outstanding results in Q4, and as I reflect on the year, three things stand out to me. Our proven growth strategy continues to drive significant share gain. Our differentiated customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status with our customers. And this, in combination with the power of our PPI Business System, drove outstanding financial performance for the quarter and full year, exceeding our ambitious goals. Our ability to deliver these results in a year that included global supply chain disruptions, a war in Ukraine, COVID-19 lockdowns in China and inflationary headwinds wouldn't be possible without the incredible dedication of our team around the world. I'm very grateful for our team's great execution in effectively navigating dynamic times and enabling the success of our company and our customers. Thanks to our colleagues, our company delivers spectacular 2022, and I couldn't be more excited for 2023. I'll get into more of the details in my remarks later, but first, let me recap the financials. Starting with the quarter. Our revenue grew 7% to $11.45 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.56 billion, and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.40 per share. Turning to our results for the full year. We grew revenue by 15% to $44.92 billion in 2022. Adjusted operating income was $10.99 billion and adjusted EPS, $23.24 per share. Let me turn to our end markets. We continue to deliver excellent and differentiated performance in Q4. This was driven by a continuation of good market conditions and outstanding execution from our global team, resulting in meaningful share gain. Let me now give you some color for the quarter and the year. Starting with our largest end market, pharma and biotech, we continue to deliver impressive performance with growth in the low teens for the quarter and mid-teens for the full year. Our differentiated customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status with our pharma and biotech customers. Throughout the year, we had broad-based strength across our businesses serving this end market, highlighted by our bioproduction, pharma services, chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses as well as the research and safety market channel. In academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digits for both the quarter and for the full year. We delivered strong growth across a range of our businesses, including biosciences, electron microscopy, chromatography and mass spectrometry as well as in the research and safety market channel.  In industrial and applied, we grew in the low teens for the quarter and mid-teens for the full year. During the year, we delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. And finally, in diagnostics and health care, in Q4, revenue was approximately 40% lower than the prior year quarter and 25% lower than full year 2021. The team delivered good core business growth during the year, led by our microbiology and transplant diagnostic businesses as well as our healthcare market channel. I'll now turn to our growth strategy, which is delivering the differentiated performance and setting us up for an even brighter future. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars : developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Starting with the first pillar. It was another terrific year of high-impact innovation as we launched outstanding new products across our businesses that strengthen our industry leadership by enabling our customers to break new ground in their important work. In chromatography and mass spectrometry, our innovations are accelerating our customers' research and unlocking deeper analytical insights. In 2022, we extended our industry-leading Thermo Scientific Orbitrap portfolio, launching the Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid mass spectrometer to advance proteomics, metabolomics and cancer biomarker research. We also launched the Thermo Scientific TRACE 1600 Series Gas Chromatograph to advance analytical testing for food, environmental, industrial and pharmaceutical applications. In electron microscopy, the new Thermo Scientific Glacios 2 Cryo-TEM was launched during the fourth quarter. It will help our customers accelerate structure-based drug discovery for debilitating disorders, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington diseases as well as research for cancer and gene mutations. We also continue to build on our genetic sciences capabilities to help our customers understand, diagnose and treat disease. During the fourth quarter, our SeCore CDx HLA sequencing system was granted marketing authorization by the U.S. FDA for use as a companion diagnostic with a T cell receptor therapy for adults with ocular melanoma. This is a really nice example of how our Specialty Diagnostics business is benefiting from our capabilities in life sciences solutions. In addition, we expanded our PCR test menu to leverage our incredibly large installed base of instruments and launched the TruMark Infectious Disease Research Panels for rapid detection and research of infectious disease pathogens. To wrap up the innovation highlights, we added to our cell and gene therapy offering, most recently launching the Gibco CTS DynaCellect Magnetic Separation System. Our solutions are helping customers advance their cell and gene therapy programs. So another spectacular year of innovation, and we have an exciting pipeline of launches in 2023 and beyond. The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers. We continue to strengthen our capabilities serving these markets during the year, and I'll highlight a recent example. In the quarter, we opened a new cGMP biologics and sterile manufacturing facility in Hangzhou, China, which provides integrated clinical and commercial drug substance and drug product capabilities to help customers in China and in the Asia Pacific region deliver patient therapies more quickly. Turning to the third pillar of our growth strategy, we continue to enhance our customer value proposition by strengthening our capabilities. We've been executing on the significant investments we've made over the past couple of years. And throughout 2022, we brought new capacity and capabilities online for pharma services, bioproduction and clinical research services. Most recently, during the fourth quarter, we opened a new state-of-the-art bioanalytical lab in Richmond, Virginia to support our clinical research business and the increasing demand for our laboratory services to accelerate drug development. As always, our PPI Business System enabled our success during the year. It's helping us to drive meaningful share gain, maximize the return on investments, meet our customers' needs and successfully navigate a dynamic environment, including effectively addressing inflation and global supply chain challenges. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day and enables outstanding execution. We continue to successfully execute our capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In 2022, we successfully integrated PPD, our clinical research business. For the full year, PPD delivered core organic growth in the high teens, generating over $7 billion in revenue and contributing over $2 to our adjusted earnings per share. The combination of a great first year performance and excellent progress on our synergy realization is delivering very strong returns for our shareholders that is well ahead of the deal model. From a customer lens, the acquisition has further elevated our trusted partner status as customers are realizing significant value in partnering with our team to advance a scientific idea to an approved medicine. In 2022, we also returned $3.5 billion of capital to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. And on the first business day of 2023, we completed the acquisition of the Binding Site, a leading specialty diagnostics company. The Binding Site is an exciting addition and highly complementary to our Specialty Diagnostic business. Together, we'll be able to advance the diagnosis and management of patients afflicted with multiple myeloma and immune disorders. Reflecting on our progress of our ESG priorities in 2022, we further advanced our environmental and philanthropic efforts while also continuing to strengthen our company culture. During the year, we continued to advance our environmental sustainability roadmap, reducing our carbon emissions and finalizing significant power purchasing agreements to accelerate our transitions towards a 100% renewable energy. Looking forward, we've also increased our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target to achieve a 50% reduction in this decade. Through our Foundation for Science, we continue to advance our philanthropic efforts and supported students across the globe during the year with our STEM education programs. This included an announcement in the quarter for the Thermo Fisher Scientific Junior Innovators Challenge, the premier middle school STEM competition in the U.S. And throughout the year, Thermo Fisher Scientific was recognized for its industry leadership and inclusive culture. This includes earning 100% score on the Human Rights Campaign 2022 Corporate Equality Index for LGBTQ equality for the seventh consecutive year as well as inclusion on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies. In the quarter, we were recognized by Forbes Magazine as one of the world's Top Female-Friendly Companies and one of America's best employers for veterans. As I reflect on the year, I'm very proud of what our team accomplished. 2022 is a special year for Thermo Fisher, and I'm excited about 2023 and beyond. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly cover the highlights. We're initiating 2023 revenue guidance of $45.3 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $23.70 per share. This very strong financial outlook reflects a continuation of our track record of delivering excellent financial performance and sustainable value creation for all of our stakeholders.  So to summarize our key takeaways for 2022, our proven growth strategy continues to drive significant share gain. Our differentiated customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status. And this, in combination with the power of our PPI Business System, drove outstanding financial performance for the quarter and full year, exceeding our ambitious goals while navigating a very dynamic macro environment. And we entered 2023 with strong momentum and we're incredibly well positioned beyond 2023. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, in Q4, we delivered an outstanding quarter, capping off another excellent year. For the quarter and the full year, we delivered 14% core organic revenue growth. This differentiated level of performance demonstrates the power of our growth strategy and the trusted partner status that we've earned with our customers. In addition, in Q4, we generated $370 million of COVID-19 testing revenue, $3.1 billion for the full year. Taking a step back and thinking about the top line performance for the year, I'm really proud of what the team delivered. We offset $4.2 billion less testing revenue, which was a headwind of over 10%, and still delivered slightly positive organic growth for the year. That's a great accomplishment. Then using the power of the PPI Business System, we were able to translate the top line strength to excellent adjusted EPS and cash flow results. In Q4, we delivered $0.23 more adjusted EPS than our prior guide, ending the year at $23.24 and delivered $6.94 billion of free cash flow, all while continuing to invest in the business to enable an even brighter future. So 2022 was another excellent year. Let me now provide you with some details on our performance. Beginning with the earnings results. As I mentioned, we delivered $5.40 of adjusted EPS in Q4 and $23.24 for the full year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.01 and $17.63 for the full year. On the top line as I mentioned in Q4, we delivered 14% core organic revenue growth and $370 million of testing revenue. Reported revenue grew 7% year-over-year. The components of our Q4 reported revenue increased included 3% lower organic revenue, a 14% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 4% from foreign exchange. The full year core organic revenue growth was 14% and we delivered $3.1 billion in testing revenue. For the full year 2022, reported revenue increased 15%. This includes slightly positive organic growth and 18% contribution from acquisitions and a 3% headwind from foreign exchange. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in 2022 and the prior year. In Q4, North America grew in the low single digits. Europe declined in the low teens. Asia-Pacific in the mid-single digits with China declining in the mid-single digits and rest of the world declined high single digits. For the full year, North America grew in the low single digits. Europe declined high single digits. Asia Pacific grew high single digits, including China, which also grew high single digits for the year, and the rest of the world declined high single digits. On a core organic growth basis, all regions had strong growth in 2022. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 19% and adjusted operating margin was 22.4%, 710 basis points lower than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 24.5%, which is 650 basis points lower than 2021. For both the fourth quarter and full year, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation, while also delivering strong productivity. This is more than offset by lower testing volumes, continued strategic investments and the expected impact of incorporating PPD into our financials. For 2022, full year adjusted operating margin was 40 basis points lower than assumed in the prior guidance. Two-thirds of this was due to business and currency mix and a third due to one-time costs related to the runoff of testing revenue. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.4%, 910 basis points lower than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 43.5%, down 810 basis points versus the prior year. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, the changing gross margin was due to the same drivers as those of our adjusted operating margin. Moving on the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.6% of revenue, an improvement of 170 basis points versus Q4 2021. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 15.8% of revenue, an improvement of 130 basis points compared to 2021. Total R&D expense was $390 million in Q4. For the full year R&D expense was $1.5 billion, representing 5% growth over the prior year, reflecting our ongoing investments in high impact innovation. R&D as percent of our manufacturing revenue was 7% in Q4, 6.4% for the full year. Looking at results below the line for the quarter and net interest expense was $119 million, which is $31 million favorable to Q4 last year. Net interest expense for the full year was $454 million, a decrease of $39 million from 2021. Adjusted other income/expense was a net expense in the quarter of $10 million compared to net income of $7 million in Q4 2021. The year-over-year variance is primarily due to changes in non-operating FX. For the full year, adjusted other income and expense of the net income of $14 million, which is $24 million lower than the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 12.8%, which is a 100 basis points lower than Q4 last year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 13% or 160 basis points lower than 2021. We repurchase $1 billion of shares in Q4, bringing our total repurchases for 2022 to $3 billion. Average diluted shares were $393 million in Q4, approximately 4 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. Full year cash flow from continuing operations was $9.15 billion. Free cash flow for the year was $6.94 billion after investing $2.2 billion of net capital expenditures. We returned $118 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter and $455 million for the full year. We ended the quarter with $8.5 billion in cash and $34.5 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.9 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.2 times on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 13.5%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we\u2019re generating across the company. Now I will provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varies by segment. And the testing revenue was significantly higher in the prior year. That does skew some of the reported segment margins. We\u2019re executing strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. And we\u2019re referring to the acquired PPD business as our Clinical Research business, and that resides in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. The anniversary date of the acquisition was December 8. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions, Q4 reported revenue in this segment declined 27%, and organic revenue was 24% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q4, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction business. This was more than offset by the moderation and testing revenue in the segment versus the prior year quarter. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment declined 13% and organic revenue declined 12%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions decreased 48% and adjusted operating margin was 34.1%, down 14 percentage points versus the prior year quarter. In Q4 we had unfavorable volume mix due to the significantly higher testing revenue in the prior year quarter. And for the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 29% and adjusted operating margin was 41.2%, a decrease of 880 basis points versus 2021. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 9% in Q4 and organic growth was 14%. A strong growth in the segment this quarter was led by electron microscopy and the chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment increased 9% and organic revenue increased 14%. Q4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 25% and adjusted operating margin was 25.4%, up 330 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull through and productivity. This was partially offset by strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 26% and adjusted operating margin was 22.8%, up 310 basis points versus 2021. Turning to our Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q4, reported revenue declined 23% and organic revenue was 20% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q4, we continue to see strong underlying growth in the core led by a healthcare market channel and our transplant diagnostics and microbiology businesses. This was offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment decreased 16% and organic revenue was 13% lower than 2021. Q4 adjusted operating income decreased 30% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 18.6%, down 190 basis points versus Q4 2021. During the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by the impact of lower testing volume. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 20% and adjusted operating margin was 21.5%, down 110 basis points versus 2021. Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, Q4 reported revenue increased 42%. Organic growth was 11% and the impact of acquisitions was 35%. During Q4, organic revenue growth in this segment was led by the Pharma Services business. PPD at Clinical Research business continued to perform very well, and during the quarter it delivered over 20% core organic revenue growth and contributed $1.9 billion of revenue to the segment. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment increased 51% and organic revenue increased 10%. Q4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 73% and adjusted operating margin was 14.1%, which is 260 basis points higher than Q4 2021. In the quarter, we drove favorable business mix and delivered strong productivity and volume pull through that was partially offset by strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 56% and adjusted operating margin was 12.8%, up 40 basis points versus 2021. Let me turn to our 2023 guidance. As Marc outlined, we\u2019re starting the year with a very strong financial outlook consisting of revenue guidance of $45.3 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $23.70. Let me provide some details to the underlying assumptions starting with revenue. Our initial guidance for 2023 assumes 7% core organic revenue growth, $400 million in testing revenue, $250 million of revenue from acquisitions and a tailwind of $100 million from FX. This all assumes a return to more normal market growth conditions in 2023 in the range of 4% to 6%. Within our core revenue, we expect $500 million of vaccines and therapies revenue in 2023. This is $1.2 billion less than 2022, a 3% impact on core organic growth. Even with this headwind, we\u2019re expecting to deliver 7% core organic revenue growth in 2023, demonstrating the strength of our initial outlook, the agility with which we\u2019re managing the business and the ongoing benefits of our growth strategy. Turning to profitability, in 2023, we\u2019re assuming an adjusted operating margin of 23.9%. This is 60 basis points lower than 2022, driven by two elements, a 40 basis points of core margin expansion and a 100 basis point headwind from the runoff of testing revenue. The year-over-year margin change is consistent with the comments I have made on the last earnings call were not [ph] described have to model a margin impact to the different elements of the year-over-year change in revenue. In 2023 with a pandemic related testing revenue behind us, I thought this would be a good opportunity to take a step back and take a multi-year view on our meaningful margin expansion progression. Starting in 2019, pre pandemic, excluding the impact of PPD, we\u2019re on track to expand operating margins, 60 basis points a year on average through 2023 and 250 basis point improvement over the full year period. It\u2019s a great progress on margin expansion. Turning to adjusted EPS. We expect to deliver $23.70 in 2023. This is a 2% year-over-year increase consisting of a 10% headwind from testing more than offset by a 12% increase driven by the core business. We\u2019re actively managing the whole P&L to effectively deal with material runoff in testing and vaccines and therapies revenue, and still grow our adjusted earnings per share for the year. This shows the strength of our growth strategy and the power of our PPI business system. Moving on to some more detailed assumptions behind the guide. With regards to FX in 2023, we\u2019re assuming it\u2019s a year-over-year tailwind of approximately a $100 million of revenue or 0.2% and $0.04 to adjusted EPS also 0.2%. We\u2019re assuming that The Binding Site acquisition will contribute approximately $250 million to our reported revenue growth and $0.07 to adjusted EPS in 2023. Below the line, we expect net interest expense in 2023 to be approximately $480 million. This approximately $25 million higher than 2022 and includes the funding for the Binding Site acquisition. We assume that the adjusted income tax rate will be 11% in 2023. The improvement from 2022 is driven by a tax planning initiative. We\u2019re expecting net capital expenditures will be approximately $2 billion in 2023 and free cash flow is assumed to be $6.9 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance assumes $3 billion for share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We estimate the full year average diluted share count were approximately 388 million shares. We\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re return approximately $540 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends. And as is our normal convention, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures. And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year. Revenue adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS are all expected to ramp up as we go through the year. This is due to several factors. Core organic revenue growth is expected increase as we go through the year, largely due to the comps related to vaccines and therapies as well as the expected phasing of economic activity in China. The impact of the runoff in testing revenue is most pronounced in Q1 and the benefits of the offsetting cost actions are spread over the year. From a foreign exchange standpoint while a slight tailwind for the year as a whole in Q1, FX is expected to be a year-over-year headwind of approximately $200 million of revenue and $80 million of adjusted operating income. Below the line, net interest expense is expected to decrease during the year as we generate free cash flow and interest on that cash build. Putting all this together for Q1, we expect core organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. Adjusted operating margin to be slightly lower than Q4 2022 and adjusted EPS to be just over 20% of the full year total. So to wrap up, we had an excellent 2022 and we\u2019re really well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance for all our stakeholders in 2023. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Rafael Tejada : Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have from the phone lines comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Your line is now open. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to start with the clinical research, PPD, performance. So high teens for the year, that's well above what we're seeing from the pure group, so a three-parter for you, Marc. What was your book-to-bill in 2022? Two, how are the revenue synergies tracking? And then three, can you talk about what sort of growth you're assuming for this business in 2023? Marc Casper : Sure. So Jack thanks for the question. Our clinical research group has performed incredibly well, a great first year as part of the company, exceeding our own high level of ambition for the business. Integration has gone smoothly. Customers really see the obvious fit with the company, and it really has driven very strong momentum. And our colleagues are very excited about the combination. So as I think about the different elements of performance, the book-to-bill was very positive. Authorizations were very strong in the quarter and the year. So we entered the year with very strong momentum in terms of the backlog that we have in the business and the authorizations. The revenue synergies, the way I would think about it is in two phases because of the long-cycle nature from a win to revenue. We've won extremely substantial revenue synergies that will show up in the financials in 2023 and beyond. We had a small amount of revenue that came into the numbers last year, but we're talking in the hundreds of millions of dollars of wins that we've achieved from an authorization standpoint, so extremely positive. And in terms of our thoughts about 2023, it will grow above of the company's average of the 7% growth that we outlined in the course. So a nice contributor to the success. And really, it's been a seamless integration for the team. We're very grateful for that. Jack Meehan : Excellent. And then I wanted to ask about the COVID vaccines and therapeutics. So you're assuming $500 million for the year. My question is simple. Just how core are your core sales? Would you ever consider changing this definition? Just confidence in the handoff as it pertains to bioprocessing in 2023? Marc Casper : Yes. So, Jack, thanks for the question. But when I think about the $500 million, right, and when I look at that, that number is primarily related to our pharma services activity. It's around actually producing the active pharmaceutical ingredients for the therapies. It's for the sterile fill finish primarily for the vaccines and some of the therapies. So we have pretty good visibility to that number. So I feel good about that. We decided back, I guess, 1.5 years ago or whatever the exact timeframe we did, the definition of core was we invested in capacity. And if you think about a sterile fill finish line, as an example, can be used for a COVID vaccine. It can also be used for pretty much any other biologic and even some of the small molecules, right? And therefore, our view was we would transition that capacity over time and we have been and we will. The other aspect of core is that if you think about how strong our growth was last year, well above our own ambitions. Even the 12% we had laid out at the end of the third quarter, we've already transitioned a meaningful amount of that revenue in terms of other activities. So we didn't contemplate at all about changing the definition of what success is. We think 7% is the right number for us. The core is the right definition for us. We'll provide transparency during the year about the different components as we always do, so that investors can understand how we're getting there. But I feel great about the outlook, and I'm very proud of what the team delivered last year. Thanks, Jack. Jack Meehan : Excellent, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have the next question from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is now open. Patrick Donnelly : Hi, good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Marc, maybe one on the Analytical Instruments business, 14% growth for the year is obviously pretty impressive. You guys have seen elevated growth for a good stretch here. It did step down a little bit against an easier comp. So I just wanted to get more color, I guess, on what you're seeing on the demand side, how you're seeing order trends and bookings there, visibility into 2023. I know you've had this elevated backlog we've talked a lot about. It seems like some peers are expecting kind of a normalization or moderation in the second half as we work our way through the year. So I want to get your perspective of what you're seeing there. Marc Casper : Yes. Patrick, thanks for the question. So when I think about the Analytical Instruments business, a really strong year, excellent execution. There's nothing different in Q4 than in Q3. So I wouldn't read anything into that. When I look at what's driving it, last year, you saw good market conditions. Funding was clearly strong. I don't know if there was a little bit of pent-up demand from 2020, I don't know. But the funding was clearly available. We did very well with our innovation, right? We stayed committed to innovation throughout the early phase of the pandemic, making sure we have robust pipelines. You saw that in the stream of launches in our chromatography, mass spectrometry and electron microscopy businesses, those products have been well adopted. We're clearly growing very well. And as you know, we've also built out a very strong presence in enabling the next generation of semiconductors, battery applications. The most advanced aspects of material science is a different market position than really anybody else has in the industry and that's driving great growth, right? And you can see it in our electron microscopy numbers. I'm very proud of how the team has executed. So, that's kind of the context of why the elevated growth. So as I think about bookings demand, very strong throughout the year. So we have good visibility to the first half. It's when those \u2013 most of those orders will ship. We would expect that the Analytical Instruments business will be a really nice contributor to our growth for the year. And I think it's reasonable to assume that the growth normalizes more in the second half as an assumption. It's not that I see something different or something happening in the market conditions, but our visibility is typically six months. So at the end of the first quarter, we'll have good visibility into the third quarter, and we'll keep you posted. But I think for modeling purpose, I think, normalization in the second half is a good assumption. Patrick Donnelly : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe one for Stephen on the margins. Gross margins seem to have rebased. I would love just your perspective of what those look like in 2023, first off. And then maybe just the additional areas of leverage kind of down the P&L coming out of COVID, you mentioned maybe some elevated strategic investments in 2022. Obviously, we saw some things like one-time bonuses that are pretty clear. But it would be helpful if you could just talk through the moving pieces, what areas of additional leverage you do have coming out of 2022. Because again, the mix, obviously as LPS becomes bigger, the margins should going to be lower, but you guys are putting up a pretty good number. So just trying to figure out, again, a little bit of the moving pieces and areas of leverage you have when you think about that 23.9% for 2023. Stephen Williamson : Yes. So Patrick, thanks for the question. So when I think about the margin profile going forward, that 7% to 9% core organic growth driving 40 to 50 basis points is the right way to think about that company. And the margin opportunity there, you got a little bit of \u2013 that just seems a little bit of price benefit, good volume leverage that comes with that and still investing in the business to maintain that top line growth. And then a continuation of using PPIs, that kind of decomplex the company, but I think that \u2013 that margin profile still holds in terms of going from the 23.9% going forward, post 2023, I think about the levers that we have. As you saw in this past year, we had a slightly different mix like higher growth in certain parts of our business. And certainly, margins were slightly different in Q4 than we had in the prior guide. But the revenue is significantly higher. And what really matters is operating income dollars that we're driving, and that's incredibly strong and I think that margin profile and then the mix then holds into 2023. And then therefore that kind of 7% to 9% driving that 40 to 50 is a good way to model the company. Patrick Donnelly : And then just gross margins for 2023, if you have it? Stephen Williamson : I don't really want to give guidance to every single element of the P&L. It's \u2013 we're trying to manage a complex company, but a similar margin profile to where we are right now is probably a good starting point. But it really depends on the mix and also changes in currency, and our job is to manage the whole thing and deliver great results. Patrick Donnelly : Thanks, very helpful. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead when you are ready. Rachel Vatnsdal : Okay, thanks, operator. So first up, just on China. China declined mid-single digits during 4Q, and you say that some of that was testing roll-off. You also talked about how China is part of the reason that that core \u2013 core growth is going to ramp throughout the year. So can you just walk us through what are you embedding for China growth for 1Q and then for total 2023? And then can you also just spend a minute talking about the underlying demand trends for China and how you plan into the reopening trade? Marc Casper : Rachel, thanks for the question. So if I step at the highest level with China, right, historically, been our fastest growing end market. We have a very strong position. Our enabling technologies are important to life sciences and food safety and the biologics industry in China, et cetera. So good demand drivers long-term, long historical perspective. When I think about last year, team delivered high single-digit growth for the year. When I think about the fourth quarter, you had very, very significant disruptions from the end of the COVID, zero COVID policies, right? So you went from this period where I think at least we had no problem in navigating through the challenges of the lockdown policies. But when you have 50%, 60%, 70% of colleagues with COVID, that's obviously highly disruptive. And so you saw the first half of the quarter was strong. The second half of the quarter was weak. Our assumption for this year is that the zero COVID, opening up the economy leads to a weaker first quarter, a strong rebound in the balance of the year. China will grow on our expectations in our guidance a little bit faster for the full year than our core growth. So that's how I would think about it. So a really strong end market, including the disruption from Q1. I think the team has done actually \u2013 I'm very impressed with how they've dealt with all of the complexities and keeping our colleagues safe. It's been a challenging period of time. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. And then maybe just kind of digging deeper on Patrick's question around margins. So you did 22.4% adjusted op ms for 4Q. You guided to a step down on that operating margin line during 1Q, but then hitting that 23.9%-ish for the year for 2023. So can you just kind of bridge us through the math there on margins and how that gives you confidence in the back half of the year to be able to round out at just shy of 24%? Stephen Williamson : Yes. So, Rachel, thanks for the question. So when I think about the margin progression through the year, Q1, we got a very significant roll-off in highly profitable testing revenue. And the cost actions against that to enable a 40% pull-through for the year, it's a combination of cost actions and then a non-repeat of the cost \u2013 of certain one-time things that we were doing on compensation in the prior year. Those things spread over the whole year. So you get a little bit of benefit in Q1 to offset part of that profitability, but more of that offset really coming in the following three quarters. So that's really the largest piece to it. Now FX is a headwind to margins in Q1, so that's a slight aspect to it. And then the phasing of the China activity is another aspect of that kind of lower level of activity in Q1 and then ramping up to a higher level of revenue in Q4. Rachel Vatnsdal : Helpful. And then maybe just squeezing one more in here on industrial and applied, you grew low teens in 4Q. So can you just give us a little bit more granularity on that performance during the quarter, if there is any pockets of outpaced strength or softness relative to your expectations? And then how are you thinking about that industrial and applied market for 2023, given the macro backdrop, and is there any conservatism there in the assumed guidance? Thanks. Marc Casper : Yes, so industrial and applied was very strong in the quarter. Low teens growth in the quarter. Really strong demand and shipments for our chromatography, mass spectrometry and electron microscopy business. So we didn\u2019t see any concerns. Our assumption for the year is that just going to grow at about the average rate growth for the full year. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re assuming in the guidance. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. Thank you. MarcCasper: Thanks, Rachel. Operator : Thank you. We now have Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Please go ahead when you are ready. Derik de Bruin : Hello, and good morning. So\u2026 Marc Casper : Good morning, Derik. Derik de Bruin : Stephen not \u2013 is not to pick on the margin point, but I do want to sort of clarify something. I mean, I \u2013 looking at the 40 basis points to 50 basis points of expansion. So let\u2019s say you do a 100 next couple of years. I mean, at your Analyst Day in May, you talked about a 26 percent-ish adjusted operating margin, excluding the impact of capital deployment. Or I mean, can you sort of just walk us through sort of like how you\u2019re thinking about the 2025 outlook that you provided and sort of like general thoughts around that and then there? Thanks. Marc Casper : Go ahead, Stephen. Stephen Williamson : Yes, when I think about margin profile, it\u2019s in combination with revenue dollars. So our revenue dollars are materially higher than we then incorporated into my long-term model. And a combination of that plus the margin gets you to a very strong operating income dollars, and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving EPS. So I\u2019m \u2013 we\u2019re well positioned with the long-term model. Derik de Bruin : Great. That\u2019s what I thought I just wanted to clarify that as well. And then just one quick follow-up. I assume there\u2019s some residual COVID business in your PPD. You talked about core growth being 20%. What is the headwind in the PPD business from leftover COVID going from 2023 to \u2013 2022 to 2023? Marc Casper : Yes, there\u2019s some activity of studies that will roll off over multiple years in terms of required follow on studies and activity there that the team as those studies come off, they just have moved to other areas of the therapeutic range. So that really has been done quite seamlessly. And as you know, with the business scaling the way it is having a large capable team is a great way to be able to be ready to serve the next set of customer work. So pretty straightforward. Derik de Bruin : And so if I can \u2013 also can I squeeze one more in CapEx sort of outlook as we go from 2023, and you have been adding a lot of facilities, can you sort of talk about what you\u2019re thinking about 2023, 2024? Marc Casper : So 2023, Stephen said it\u2019s a couple billion dollars and we\u2019ll continue to \u2013 it will kind of go down to a glide path back to that 3.5% \u2013 3% to 3.5% from over time. So nothing\u2019s changed in that assumption. Derik de Bruin : Great. Thank you. Marc Casper : Thanks, Derik. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Brennan of Cowen. Your line is now open Dan. Dan Brennan : Great, thank you. Maybe Marc to kick it off, just I\u2019m all in on Aaron Rodgers if the Jets can get him. That\u2019d be like a struggling company getting \u2013 that\u2019d be like a struggling company getting you as a CEO would be a great deal I think so. So that\u2019s one of my questions here. Maybe the first one, just obviously, there\u2019s a lot of concerns in the industry broadly on the near-term drag on revenue growth for biologic drug products. Given the inventory, depletion that\u2019s ongoing in the industry, you\u2019ve been pretty confident that for various reasons, Thermo is really not seeing this. Just would be interesting to get an update on kind of just on your thinking there and kind of what you\u2019re assuming in your outlook for 7% growth for your businesses both on the consumable side and on the Patheon services side? Marc Casper : Yes, so in terms of football, Hope Springs Eternal until the first snap. In terms of the bioproduction business what I would say is a few points. Obviously not every single player has reported, but a couple of them have. So we have a sense of how the industry did and what others have said. When I think about last year, our bioproduction business just crushed it again, right? It just phenomenal performance well above the rate of growth of our pharma and biotech customer set. And that\u2019s three years in a row of really very strong growth. Very proud of how the team has executed. When I think about 2023 against tougher comparisons, obviously, the growth will normalize a bit. And I would expect that based on some of the COVID comparisons of the first half of 2022, that you\u2019ll see more normalization in the first half, stronger in the second half is the pattern, but it\u2019s a good business with incredibly bright prospects. So from that perspective, I feel good about how the team\u2019s managing it, what the \u2013 what 2023 will contribute and what the long term is going to be fantastic. Pharma Services businesses has had a very good year, very strong growth, has brought its capacity online very effectively and winning a lot of new business. We still have activity this year that\u2019s meaningful in the vaccine therapies for COVID. And then as those wind down at some point in time, it\u2019s hard to know what the longer-term visibility is for that capacity just gets repurposed on the thing. So we do that in an orderly fashion. So that\u2019s how I think about it. But a really strong year and some really nice meaningful wins throughout 2022 that sets up the Pharma Services business [indiscernible]. Dan Brennan : Got it. And then \u2013 and maybe this is a follow-up. Obviously, your business mix is a lot less cyclical today than it was back in the prior downturn. I\u2019m just wondering implicit in the seven, and Rachel asked the question on industrial business. But just to what extent does your guide bacon some cushion for potential slowdown that could unfold given weaker macro? Marc Casper : Yes, so what we assumed is normal market conditions, right? And if the way I would characterize last year was above normal market conditions. So normal in my definition is marked goes 4% to 6%, right? And we said that for a very, very long time. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re assuming for this year. If it\u2019s materially different than that, meaning that if the market conditions look anything like they look last year, we\u2019re going to grow well above the core guidance. If the market conditions are meaningfully worse, then what\u2019s assumed the normal market conditions, then we\u2019re going to grow lower than the core organic that we outlined. So nothing\u2019s dramatic about that. And we\u2019ll be super transparent and all our investors will understand if the world is totally different than what it looks like on February 1. What we know is that we\u2019re going to manage incredibly well. So whatever the world throws at us will come out with great short-term performance and a much stronger industry leader for the long term. And that\u2019s what\u2019s super cool about Thermo Fisher because it\u2019s our job to manage the dynamics and do it great and do a great job for our investors. So I\u2019m excited for what the world upholds in 2023 and beyond. Dan Brennan : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Dan. We now have Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead when you\u2019re ready. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys. Congrats on a really strong finish with the year and thanks for taking my question. I had two parts. Maybe I\u2019ll ask them both upfront. Marc, the first part for you on when I look at this guidance and base organic excluding vaccine, I think the business did \u2013 the business is assuming perhaps low double-digit organic here in fiscal 2023 in that coming off of perhaps a mid-teens comp. One is that math correct that base business excluding vaccine double digit? And what is it assuming? I\u2019m assuming \u2013 I\u2019m thinking biopharma has to grow at least mid-teens to get to the 9% to 10%. And it seems pretty strong. Do those numbers make sense? And Stephen, the second part for you on margins here, what are you assuming for decremental margins on COVID and margins in FX? And did I hear you correctly on Q1 is starting at 22%, just wanted to make sure I heard the numbers right. Marc Casper : Sure. So in terms of the guidance and the 7% core, we did not do a lot of machinations about excluding this or that. I think from the math, the way you\u2019re doing it is that if you excluded the vaccines and therapies, it would imply that the growth was 9% or 10%, somewhere in that range is about what the growth would be on that measure of which we\u2019re not using that particular measure. Therefore, you can\u2019t sort of speculate on sort what all the dynamics, it\u2019s much better to just say relative to our 7% grow pharma and biotech, we expect to grow above that, right, in terms of its contribution to the 7%. And we would assume that the industrial and applied would go around the 7% core and the other two markets are a little bit below. So that\u2019s how you should think about the different dynamics. Stephen Williamson : Yes, Vijay in terms of the pull through on the lower testing revenue, as I outlined in the last quarter, the assumptions are approximately 40% in aggregate for the whole year. But that doesn\u2019t all \u2013 that\u2019s not the same in every single quarter. Like the offsetting cost actions against a very significant profitability pull through, which is higher than that on a contribution margin basis that\u2019s spread across each of the quarters. But the revenue drop is largely just in Q1. So that\u2019s why you have the margin profile that I outlined for Q1. And the indication I gave for Q1 margin profile at this point is slightly below what has the margin in Q4. So the largest driver there is that a large drop in very profitable testing, and then the offset on the costs to get it to the 40% pull through spread throughout the year. Thanks, Vijay. Marc Casper : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Stifel. Please go ahead when you\u2019re ready. Dan Arias : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for getting me in here. Marc, maybe just one on bioprocess, bioproduction. I just wanted to ask whether you\u2019re seeing any differences in purchasing patterns and the way that inventories just appear as though they\u2019re being managed when you look at CDMOs versus the biopharmas themselves. There has been some conversation around just timelines that look like they might materialize on destocking. So curious if you can just sort of help us what might be taking place given where you sit here? Marc Casper : Yes, that\u2019s sort of along the line [indiscernible] question, really not much to add, right, which is phenomenal 2022. We created a really challenging and exciting comparison. We get paid to create those comparisons and I would expect that would show up in a more normalized growth in the first half and a little bit stronger than that in the second half. And I think there\u2019s much color between the different customer types or that would provide much more insight on it. Dan Arias : Okay. Thanks so much. Marc Casper : Welcome. So let me wrap it up here. Thanks everyone for participating in the call. With another strong year behind us, we\u2019re in a great position to achieve another excellent year in 2023. And as always, thank you for support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. And we look forward to updating you during the course of the year as it progresses. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you all for joining. That does conclude today\u2019s call. Please have a lovely day and you may now disconnect your lines.",

My name is Charlie and I'll be coordinating the call today. You will have the opportunity to ask a question at the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce our moderator for today's call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may begin the call. Rafael Tejada : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investor section of our website thermofisher.com under the heading News & Events until May 12th, 2023. A copy of the press release of our first quarter 2023 earnings is available in the investor section of our website under the heading Financials.

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our first quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we had a very strong start to the year. We delivered another quarter of very strong financial performance. Our core business is performing very well. I'm pleased with the team's great execution and the share gain we saw across our company, especially within the context of a slightly more challenging macro environment. Our continued success is the result of our proven growth strategy that trusted partner status that we've earned with our customers and our PPI Business System, which is a differentiator for us and enables operational excellence within the company. So let me first recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter was $10.71 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.33 billion and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.03 per share. At the beginning of the year, we set out appropriately ambitious guidance for 2023 and Q1 demonstrates that we're delivering against that. Let me turn to our end markets. We delivered very strong performance in Q1, driven by outstanding execution from our team, resulting in meaningful share gain. Pandemic related activity performed as we had expected during the quarter. As a reminder, the impact of the headwind from the revenue runoff can be seen in pharma and biotech due to vaccines and therapies and in diagnostics and healthcare due to COVID-19 testing. Let me give you some color on our end markets. Starting with pharma and biotech. We delivered growth in the mid-single digits for the quarter. During the quarter, we had very strong performance in our pharma services, clinical research and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. In academic and government, we grew in the high-single digits in the quarter. We delivered strong growth across a range of our businesses, including chromatography, mass spectrometry, electron microscopy, as well as the research and safety market channel. Academic and government demand were strong in all regions. In industrial and applied, we grew in the high-single digits for the quarter. We saw strong growth in all of our analytical instrument businesses, including electron microscopy, chemical analysis and chromatography and mass spectrometry. Finally, in diagnostics and health care, in Q1, revenue was approximately 45% lower than the prior year quarter. The team delivered very good core business growth during the quarter led by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology and transplant diagnostic businesses. I'll now turn to our proven growth strategy, which enables us to continue to deliver differentiated performance and setting us up for an even brighter future. As a reminder, our growth strategy consists of three pillars developing high impact, innovative new products, leveraging our scale and the high growth in emerging markets, and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Starting with the first pillar, innovation. We had an excellent start to the year as we launched a number of high impact new products across our businesses during the first quarter. These technologies are further strengthening our industry leadership by enabling our customers to break new ground in their important work. In elemental analysis, we launched the Thermo Scientific iCAP RQ Plus ICP-MS Analyzer. This ICP mass spectrometry system simplifies analysis of trace elements in complicated samples, including the identification of heavy metals in soil and water as well as toxic elements in food and beverage. In Genetic Sciences, we launched the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio Absolute Q AutoRun dPCR Suite, an automated digital PCR solution to increase productivity for molecular research, including cell and gene therapy and cancer research. In our Biosciences business, we launched the Invitrogen DynaGreen, microplastic-free magnetic beads for protein purification. This new product will help our customers to reduce the environmental impact of life science research and builds on our long history of innovation and market leadership in bioscience reagents. And in our Clinical Diagnostics business, we launched the Thermo Scientific DRI Tramadol assay, which broadens our extensive toxicology portfolio with a new drug of abuse assay to help fight the opioid crisis. These are just a few examples of the innovation going on across our company, and I'm excited about the robust pipeline of products that will be launched throughout the year. We also recently learned that Thermo Fisher was ranked number 22 on Fortune's Most Innovative Companies List. This is a new award launched in 2023 based on product and process innovation and a company's culture. A really nice recognition of our team and their track record. The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale and the high growth in emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers. We continue to strengthen our capabilities serving these markets by opening a new Gibco cell culture rapid prototyping facility at our existing site in Suzhou, China. This facility will help regional customers accelerate the transition of their cell culture media production into current good manufacturing practices. It will also ensure patients receive therapies manufactured to the highest level of safety, effectiveness, quality and purity. Turning to the third pillar of our growth strategy. We continue to enhance our customer value proposition by strengthening our capabilities to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. I've had the opportunity to meet with dozens of our pharmaceutical and biotech customers since the beginning of the year, and our value proposition is clearly resonating. Our trusted partner status gives us an early understanding of customers unmet needs and the ability to generate insights that allow for deep collaborations that continue to advance scientific breakthroughs. During Q1, we achieved an exciting milestone in our strategic partnership with the University of California, San Francisco with the opening of a new cell therapy cGMP Manufacturing and Collaboration Center to accelerate the development of breakthrough therapies for glioblastoma, multiple myeloma and other cancers. In this facility, we offer UCSF and other customer solutions for cell therapy development, from discovery to clinical research through to commercial manufacturing. Partnerships like this have the potential to transform clinical care. Another example of our customer value proposition and the trusted partner status that we have established with our pharma and biotech customers can be seen in the excellent performance of our clinical research business, which drove very strong growth in the quarter. I'm very excited by the revenue synergies that will drive both short-term and longer term growth in the business. The momentum is continuing to build and is benefiting both our clinical research business and other parts of the company. We're also working with very engaged customers on longer term projects to explore ways to reduce the time and cost of bringing drugs to market. By bringing our capabilities and expertise within our pharma services and clinical research businesses together, we are working to improve the effectiveness of the drug development process, benefiting both our customers and their patients. We have an exciting pilot underway that is utilizing dedicated resources and best-in-class technologies and capabilities to provide enhanced visibility and real-time data to the customer. This improves the speed of decision making and reduces potential delays from development to manufacturing to clinical trials. It can also help our customers take cost out of the process by reducing waste in the clinical supply process. This is really a nice example of why we are the trusted partner. As always, our PPI Business System and our mission driven culture enabled our success during the quarter. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day, and it enables us to improve quality, productivity and the customer experience, while also helping us to navigate a dynamic environment. You can see the positive impact of our PPI Business System and our results in Q1. It is also allowed us to capitalize on the strong demand from customers for analytical instrumentation and has also helped us to effectively address the runoff and pandemic related activity and appropriately manage our costs. Moving to capital deployment. We've had an active start to the year both in strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. We closed the acquisition of The Binding Site at the beginning of the year. It's great to have this business now as part of the company. The business is a fantastic fit with our Specialty Diagnostics business and we're leveraging our capabilities to take an excellent business and make it even better. The integration is going very smoothly and the business is performing very well, tracking ahead of plan. Our team is focused on advancing the diagnosis and management of patients with multiple myeloma and immune disorders, and the innovation pipeline looks great. We're excited by the opportunity to further advance patient care in this area. In terms of return of capital, during the quarter, we repurchased $3 billion of stock and increased our dividend by 17%. So, overall, a great start to the year from capital deployment. During the quarter, we also advanced our environmental, social and governance priorities, including securing agreements to power all current US sites with 100% renewable energy by 2026. This is a significant contribution to our 2030 commitment to a 50% of reduction in Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions. As we continue to transition away from fossil fuels and adopt renewable energy, we're also accelerating our progress towards our commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. We'll be releasing our latest Corporate Social Responsibility report later this quarter and will give our stakeholders a really substantive view on our continuous improvement and the positive impact that we're having. Let me now turn to our guidance. Since the beginning of the year, the macro environment has become slightly more challenging. We're stepping up to that challenge and our proven growth strategy, powered by our PPI Business System, is enabling us to maintain our ambitious full year outlook with revenues of $45.3 billion and adjusted EPS of $23.70. Stephen will take you through the details in his remarks. So to summarize our key takeaways from the first quarter. Our very strong results in Q1 were driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI Business System. Our business is performing very well. Our unique customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status and we're continuing to gain market share. We effectively deployed capital to create significant value for our customers and shareholders, and we're incredibly well positioned to deliver differentiated performance and an excellent 2023 as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, we started the year with a very strong Q1. Our growth strategy powered by our PPI Business System is enabling us to continue to very effectively navigate the company through a dynamic macro environment, manage the runoff in pandemic related revenue and drive excellent core organic revenue growth and share gains. In the quarter, we delivered $10.7 billion of revenue, which included 6% core organic revenue growth. We delivered $5.03 of adjusted EPS. Our core organic revenue growth was 1% higher than we had incorporated in our previous 2023 guidance, and adjusted EPS was $0.02 ahead. So a very strong start to the year. Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance. So beginning with our earnings results, as I mentioned, we delivered $5.03 of adjusted EPS in Q1. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $3.32. On the top line reported revenue was 9% lower year-over-year. The components of our Q1 reported revenue included 8% lower organic revenue, a 1% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 2% from foreign exchange. Pandemic related revenue came in as we expected in Q1. This is comprised of $140 million of testing revenue and $180 million of vaccines and therapies revenue. As I mentioned earlier, core organic revenue growth in the quarter was 6%. And as a reminder, core organic revenue growth continues to include the change in our COVID-19 vaccines and therapies revenue, which was a headwind of approximately 3% in the quarter. So very strong core performance showing the continued strength of our business. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the pandemic related revenue in the current and prior year. In Q1, North America declined high-single digits. Europe declined in the low-double digits. Asia Pacific grew in the low-single digits, with China declining slightly and Rest of World declined high-single digits. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 32% and adjusted operating margin was 21.8%, 740 basis points lower than Q1 last year. In the quarter, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation while also driving strong productivity. This was more than offset by lower pandemic related revenue and continued strategic investments. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 40.3%, 720 basis points lower than Q1 last year. For the first quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for our adjusted operating margin. Moving on to the details of P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.3% of revenue. Total R&D expense was $350 million in Q1, reflecting our ongoing investments in high impact innovation. R&D as a percent of manufacturing revenue was 6.9% in the quarter. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter and net interest expense was $154 million, which is $36 million higher than Q1 last year, mainly due to capital deployment. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10%. This is 410 basis points lower than Q1 last year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. Average diluted shares were $388 million in Q1, approximately $6 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $730 million. Free cash flow for Q1 was $280 million after investing $450 million in net capital expenditures. During the quarter, we deployed $5.8 billion of capital. This included $2.7 billion for the acquisition of The Binding Site and $3.1 billion of capital to return to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash and $35.3 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.9 times on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 12.2%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that were generating across the company. Now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our pandemic related revenue varies by segment, and that revenue was significantly higher in the prior year. So that does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins. We continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. Moving on to the segment details starting with Life Science Solutions. Q1 reported revenue in the segment declined 38% and organic revenue was 37% lower than the prior year quarter. This was driven by the moderation in pandemic related revenue in the segment versus the year ago quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 62% and adjusted operating margin was 32%, down 19 percentage points versus the prior year quarter. In the quarter, we delivered good productivity, which was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix due to the significantly higher pandemic related revenue in Q1 2022. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 14% in Q1 and organic growth was 17%. The strong growth was broad based in the segment this quarter led by chromatography and mass spectrometry and the electron microscopy businesses. Q1 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 40% and adjusted operating margin was 24.4%, up 460 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull-through, strong productivity and favourable business mix. This was partially offset by strategic investments. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q1, reported revenue declined 25% and organic revenue was 28% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q1, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core led by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology and transplant diagnostics businesses. This was offset by lower pandemic related revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income decreased 21% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 25.3%, which is 140 basis points higher than Q1 2022. During the quarter, we delivered favourable business mix and strong productivity, which is partially offset by the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volumes. Finally, in Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. Q1 reported revenue increased 6% and organic growth was 7%. During Q1, organic revenue growth in this segment was led by the pharma services and clinical research businesses. Q1 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 28% and adjusted operating margin was 13.8%, which is 240 basis points higher than Q1 2022. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity and volume pull-through. This was partially offset by strategic investments. Let me now turn to guidance. And as Marc outlined, we're maintaining our guidance for full year 2023, consisting of revenue guidance of $45.3 billion, including 7% core organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS guidance of $23.70. There's no net change overall in our guidance, but how we expect to achieve this guidance is different from the way we planned at the start of the year, and it demonstrates our ability to effectively navigate the dynamic macro environment and maintain a very strong financial outlook. Since our initial guide, we see $0.25 of additional headwinds to adjusted EPS, $0.15 from business mix and $0.10 from FX. We're actively offsetting all of this headwind about $0.20 through cost management and $0.05 through actions below the line. So no net change overall. The PPI Business System is enabling us to navigate the company very effectively through a dynamic macro environment. As I mentioned, the 2023 guidance reflects a very strong financial outlook. Let me remind you of some of the key underlying assumptions that remain unchanged from the previous guidance. We continue to assume 7% core organic revenue growth from market growth of 4% to 6%. Within that core revenue, we expect $500 million of vaccines and therapies revenue in 2023. This is $1.2 billion less than the prior year, a 3% impact on core organic revenue growth. It's worth noting that the majority of our vaccine and therapy revenue in 2023 is expected to be in our pharma services business. With regards to testing revenue, we continue to assume $400 million for 2023. We're assuming The Binding Site acquisition will contribute approximately $250 million to our reported revenue growth this year. Below the line, we expect net interest expense in 2023 to be approximately $480 million. We continue to assume that net capital expenditures will be approximately $2 billion in 2023 and free cash flow is assumed to be $6.9 billion for the year. Our guidance includes $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We estimate the full year average diluted share count will be approximately 388 million shares. And we're assuming we return approximately $540 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, a 17% increase over 2022. So turning now to the assumptions that have changed. As I mentioned earlier, our FX assumption for the year has changed. We still expect FX to be a tailwind to revenue of approximately $100 million or 0.2%. However, we now expect it to be a headwind to adjusted EPS of $0.06. That's $0.10 more of a headwind than the previous guidance due to changes in rates and the expected mix of our currencies. Guidance assumes adjusted operating margins for 2023 to be in the range of 23.8% to 23.9% for the year. The adjusted tax rate assumption has improved slightly from our initial guide. We now expect it to be 10.8% for the full year. And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year. Compared to our initial phasing assumptions, we now expect a slightly higher weighting of revenue and adjusted EPS in the second half of the year. We're currently assuming that the first half of the year represents approximately 48% of our full year revenue dollars and 44% of our full year adjusted EPS dollars. Q2 core organic growth is expected to be mid-single digits, probably best to model at a slightly lower than Q1. To conclude, we delivered a very strong start to the year and we're in great position to deliver differentiated performance for all our stakeholders in 2023. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Rafael Tejada : Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Jack, your line is open. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. So my question is focused on lab products, biopharma services. First is on PPD. So we've been getting some mixed signals so far this earnings around biotech customer demand. Marc, I would love to get your perspective. How did PPD grow this quarter? What does the outlook assume? Has that changed at all? And then can you talk about award trends that you're seeing? Thanks. Marc Casper : Yes. So Jack thanks for the question. Good morning. Our clinical research business, PPD had a very strong start to the year. The growth continues to be in the mid-teens. And it's doing really well. We had strong backlog. We had good level of authorization. So that business is continuing to benefit from the revenue synergies. You've seen that start to come into the numbers this year and I'm very excited about the prospect. Team is doing a really good job of executing. Environment is definitely a little bit more challenging, but the team is doing a good job to go out and capture the business. Jack Meehan : Great. Okay. And then one more on that segment is just would love to hear your color around how the research channel performed this quarter. Can you just talk about core market demand and any share dynamics that you're seeing? Thank you. Marc Casper : Our channel business, Fisher Scientific channel has done really well actually consistently for quite a number of years. It plays an amazing role in enabling our customers to do the research that they're doing and make sure they do that in an effective and efficient way. And the business is off to a good start. It has had good growth. And our best sense on share dynamics as it continues to win customers. So it's a well-performing business. Jack Meehan : Super. Thank you. Marc Casper : Thanks, Jack. Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Jack. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal of JPMorgan. Rachel, your line is open. Please go ahead. Rachel Vatnsdal : Perfect. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And so first half, two of your peer have recently talked about visibility within bioprocessing being pressured to more like three to six months of visibility versus historical nine to 12 months. So can you just walk us through what's your current level of visibility? And is that different between customer sets within large pharma versus some of these emerging biotech customers? And then also, how does PPD and having that business impact your level of visibility there? Marc Casper : Sure. So, Rachel, good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll step up a level first, and then I'll talk about the specifics of the question because as I look and read some of the other industry participants reports so far. Clearly, a noisy quarter in the industry. And when I frame that, as a reminder, when we started the year, we set out ambitious goals for 2023, right? And we do that every year. For us, a 7% core growth from an organic perspective against a 14% comparison and also have very strong earnings. So that's sort of as we came into the year. So what's different in late April versus February 1st when we set out our guidance. Well, the first thing is, we delivered a great chart to the year, right? Great Q1. Second, the macroeconomic environment is more challenging, right? And that leads to a slightly more cautious spend in all sectors of the economy, nothing to do with life science tools and pharma services. But we also see that in some of our customers as well in terms of the caution. Within our own company, a couple of our businesses are performing slightly better than our original guidance, and that's our analytical instruments business which had an excellent Q1 and we now have more visibility into Q3 for that business and that looks encouraging. The second business is doing a little bit better than our original guidance with Specialty Diagnostics is also a strong start. Bioproduction, which is where your question is really focused, we're going to see in the first half more headwinds than our original expectation. It's driven really by the customers are benefiting from the improved lead times that we're delivering against because we brought our -- completed our network expansion, right? So customers can get products more quickly. And our view is this is a temporal phenomenon, and we feel good about what the long-term prospects here. In terms of the specifics in terms of visibility and by customer sets and those things. I think the way that I think about it is, long-term, this is an incredible market with great growth. It's grown very high for many years in the past and has incredible tailwinds. It has a reasonably good visibility because it's related to customer production. And our expectation is that the second half of the year is better than the first half of the year in terms of the view. As a reminder, Rachel, it represents 10% of our revenue. So I think it's important to keep that in the context as well. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. Thank you. And then maybe just one on instruments. Analytical Instruments grew 17% during the quarter. You flagged that that's one of the areas that's been better than expected so far versus your initial guidance for the year. So can you walk us through what are your latest expectations for Analytical Instrument growth for the year? And then are there any end markets within AI that are just growing faster than expected? Thanks. Marc Casper : Yes. So in terms of our instruments business, we really are benefiting from very strong adoption of our innovation, right? We just continue to bring out great products. As a reminder, during the pandemic, we continue to fuel and accelerate our R&D pipeline, and you're seeing the benefit of it. We are capitalizing on the semiconductor desire to move to the next generation of nodes, which uses our electromicroscopy. We're a key enabler for battery technology with our microscopes and our chromatography and mass spectrometry business doing incredibly well. So the strength here is broad based. Obviously, the 17% growth in the quarter, very strong. We would expect a good level of growth in Q2. And what we had said at the beginning of the year is that, that would moderate in the second half, and we think that moderation will be less than we originally expected in Q3. So we expect it to be a solid Q3, and we'll obviously have more visibility to Q4 when we report in July. So we're assuming that Q3 is little better than we expected and Q4 as we expected at this point because that's what we have visibility to. Thanks, Rachel. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Derik, your line is open. Please proceed. Derik De Bruin : Hi. Good morning. So I'm curious you've talked about ambitious guide and the markets being a little bit tougher. Yes, you're maintaining guidance because you're offsetting some things right now. I guess, is there additional little room to do further offsets if the market curates further there. Basically, it's a question about your confidence in that guide and how much sort of like leeway is built into it? Thanks. Marc Casper : Yes. So Derek, the way that we manage the company, right, is the first thing we want to deliver differentiated performance in a given year that we would be proud of delivering and strengthen the company for the long-term, right? And that's the first set of principles. And that set of principles has served us very well for many years. And when you look at our track record, we do a good job of delivering short-term and strength in the long-term. When I think about the outlook for the year and where we are we feel good about the full year guidance at this point in time based on how Q1 has played out and the changes and we've laid out some of the assumptions around that for the balance of the year. And if those assumptions are largely the way the year plays out, we're going to be in a great position. If those assumptions are too conservative, we'll beat these numbers. If those assumptions are too aggressive then we will appropriately adjust guidance over time, right? And I'm not shy about any of those dynamics. We try to give you total transparency and I feel good about our outlook based on Q1 and the assumptions that we're making. Derik De Bruin : Got it. And going back, I mean, because we're obviously getting a lot of questions on the whole bioprocessing and inventory issues. I know your business is more upstream focused on downstream and it looks like you're maintaining the expectations you have for the COVID vaccine element. But can you just talk a little bit more about some of the dynamics in that space? And why your business is a little bit different than some other ones? And also just you talked about some moderating in bioproduction. Just a little bit more clarity on that. Thanks. Marc Casper : Yeah, sure. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Just can I level set for a second on the actual revenue for 2023, the $500 million of vaccines and therapies. That's pretty much all in our pharma Services business, it's not in the bioproduction business. Derik De Bruin : Got it. Okay. Marc Casper : Yes. So when I think about the dynamics here, on the COVID vaccine, as Stephen said, my take is, it's played out almost exactly. I mean Q1 is exactly where we anticipated when we look at our visibility to the $500 million, I feel very good about that in terms of it because we know the contracts that we have and what activity has been booked there. So that's pretty straightforward. When I think about the bioproduction more generally, what I would say is in the very practical dynamics to go back to the pandemic, right? Huge demand, right, for these products. Those companies that were successful and unsuccessful and trying to bring out therapies and vaccines for response to the pandemic. That stressed lead times for everybody. Obviously, it varies differently by how much capacity, how well companies are on all those different dynamics, but lead times got super extended, right? For us and the nature of our products, our leadership in cell culture media and single use. Customers don't really order extra. It's not one of these things where you want to be stockpiling this stuff because they're very specific to the campaigns that you're running, right? So the dynamic becomes very simple. If we have a 30-week lead time, which was extended during the pandemic, you order 30 weeks -- with 30 weeks visibility. When we bring that lead time back into normal to say 15 weeks for simplicity, customers will work through what they ordered because they don't have to order as quickly because they know we're going to give them the product, right? And one of the themes that we said throughout the pandemic was we work super closely with our customers like incredible around the dialogue. So they trust that we're going to deliver when we say. So they didn't over order in the time when lead times got extended and they're ordering appropriately now. So can you call that to the month? No, of course, not. But we have a reasonable view that the first half is going to be a little bit softer than we originally had put in our expectations that the second half starts to pick up. And the good news is between instruments, especially diagnostics, it's offsetting at this point. So hopefully that's helpful. Derik De Bruin : Great. Thanks. Marc Casper : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Brennan of Cowen. Dan, your line is open. Please go ahead. Daniel Brennan : Great. Thank you. Thanks for the questions. Marc, while we had to wait for the conference call to get the core organic guide reiteration for Thermo. The Jets went up to you by giving us Aaron Rodgers trade before the draft. Fans have to be excited for the year. I hope you are. So maybe just on bioproduction, a question there. Would you be willing to share with us just some color within the context of your biopharma outlook for 2023. How you're thinking about the growth rates for your consumables business the CDMO and PPD. I know on the last call, you gave us PPD, but just trying to get a breakdown or a sense of the different components for your biopharma outlook for the year? Marc Casper : Yes. So Dan, thanks for the question. And in the spring, hope springs eternal in football because [indiscernible] hasn't been made yet. But effectively, from my perspective, pharma and biotech is a good question. If you take -- let's focus on the market itself, right? When I think about the quarter, we delivered mid-single digit growth, right? And when you think about what's embedded in that is obviously that's where the vaccine and therapy rolloff is from the prior year. So we did it exactly as we expected. So that basically you have double-digit growth, not a big normalization guys, but just to try to make it simple, if you didn't have a vaccine and therapy rolloff, you'd have double-digit growth in that segment. So most of the change from trajectories around that. I think the second thing to remember is that last year, we grew 14%. This year, we grew -- we're expecting to grow 7%. The expectation, obviously, is therefore our growth, while outstanding is going to be more moderate than last year and given the pharma and biotech is our largest customer segment, obviously, our expectation is that growth will moderate. I would say largely, Q1 was pretty similar to what we thought it would be with bioproduction being a little bit softer. You can say there's a little bit more caution in the smaller biotech customers. But do I think it's like dramatically different? I don't, right? And so we're working through that and we have strength in other parts of our mix. And that's kind of where we are. On all the details of each of the businesses by customer side, they don't really manage that way. And on the bioproduction side, as I said a little bit earlier, in total, it represents about 10% of our revenue. Daniel Brennan : Great. Thank you for that, Marc. And then maybe as a follow-up on earlier question on instruments. You talked about better visibility. So what is -- you talked a lot about share gains as well. So maybe could you give us a sense of how you're somewhat bucking the trend that the other peers are seeing after a strong couple of years. You're still seeing above corporate average growth, others are kind of citing more comps. So what's driving between FEIC, LC-MS and any geographies or anything you want to share with us about the strength in your AI business for 2023? Marc Casper : Yes. The team is doing a good job executing, right? They're doing a good job on navigating the various supply chain things that happened over the last couple of years and our shipments are at a high level we're going out and winning business. I think the strategy that the team has executed around breakthrough innovation. Customers find money when the products are really relevant. I mean that's been my experience. Over long periods of time or if you have great products, customers want them. So that's been a positive dynamic certainly for the instruments business. And what I would say is we definitely have challenging comparisons this year. We're off to a good start. And I would expect that growth will moderate a bit in the second half, but Q3 being a little bit better than we originally expected. Daniel Brennan : Great. Thank you, Marc. Marc Casper : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sykes of Goldman Sachs. Matt, your line is open. Please proceed. Matthew Sykes : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe Marc or Stephen, just first on sort of regional trends. Stephen, you outlined some of the growth in the quarter for Europe and China, but just any incremental color on what you're seeing, particularly in China across your business and how you think that those trends play out over the course of this year? Marc Casper : Yes. So, Matt, thanks for the question. China actually played out pretty much as we expected in the quarter, right? So our expectation for Q1 was it was going to be slightly better than Q4 that you'd still see some of the impact of the unwind of the Zero COVID policy. And that as the year progresses, it will continue to strengthen from there. When I look at the first quarter in China, the business was down slightly. The core growth actually was high-single digits in the quarter. So that felt good. What I would say is, we expected stimulus to happen in the first quarter. It did happen in the first quarter. So that played out. It was good to see the Chinese government released money to the academic institutions. You see that in our instrument business. And so that played out well. And so I feel good about the outlook. Obviously, the geopolitical tensions are real, and that's an environment that is going to be around, I would suspect for a while. And we'll navigate through it, but China should be a good market for us this year and it has been historically. Stephen, anything on the -- Stephen Williamson : Yes. So Matt, on the other end markets, when I think there's a lot of noise from the pandemic unwind, but when I kind of see through that, good growth really across all of the main geographies. So nothing really to call out there. Matthew Sykes : Got it. And then just maybe one high level on PPD. You talked about the growth there. And obviously, it's been outgrowing peers. Can we attribute any of that outsized growth to sort of the value proposition that being a part of Thermo might represent for your customer base? Or is it still too early to kind of see that potential growth impact come in and this is just PPD executing as it has been. Marc Casper : I think our team is doing a great job of executing, right? They are out there serving customers and patients so that customers are making a great choice to work with us, right? They're doing a really good job. We clearly have a high level of new authorizations because of the combination of what Thermo Fisher brings and what PPD brought together, right? So there's a lot of customer interest. It shows up in authorization is showing up in our revenue now. That continues to build. And I'm excited. Next year will be year three. And, as a reminder, that's $250 million of revenue that we're assuming from a revenue synergy next year. So it's really exciting in terms of where it is, and I feel good about the performance of the business and the outlook. Matthew Sykes : Thank you. Marc Casper : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore. Vijay, your line is open. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the steady front here. Marc, my first question for you, high level. I think your prior guidance for biopharma end market was slightly north of corporate about 7% or thereabouts. Did that change at all, Marc? And if it did change, where is the change coming from between CDMO CRO and bioprocessing in -- could you just remind us what is Thermo's exposure to early-stage biotech emerging pharma? Marc Casper : Yes. So Vijay, we gave like 80,000 foot directional views on the markets at the end of the -- at the beginning of the year to set the guidance context. And when I think about the additional color that Steve and I have provided today, it really says that it's more business focused, which is actually how we manage our company. Instrument specialty diagnostics a little bit stronger bioproduction a little bit softer primarily in the first half. So that translates probably into a tiny little changes within the end markets, but nothing that really jumps out as something meaningfully different. What I would say is in terms of the early biotech, those are a great customer set that we have done a fantastic job serving. Yesterday, I was actually talking to roughly 400 members of that community at a customer event here in the Greater Boston area. And like the room was buzzing, not because I was speaking, but rather just like me walking in and this is such energy and excitement. So why is that? Because they're bringing through cures that are going to exception an enormous difference. The science is phenomenal. So there's clearly going to be more caution in that segment, depending on the funding environment, but the science is great. The passion is extraordinary. And we are the company that people come to advance the molecule from a scientific idea to an improved medicine. So it's customers that we love, we're going to do well. And we obviously generate the vast majority of our revenue from the large pharma and biotech customers, and they're doing well, and we've got a strong position there. So hopefully that at least gives you the qualitative context of how to think about it. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful perspective, Marc. And Stephen one quick follow-up for you. Second quarter guidance mid-single. I think you said second quarter perhaps below Q1, the comps will get easier for you in 2Q. So maybe just walk us through on the Q2 thought process? Stephen Williamson : Really, the main piece is just the timing on the bioproduction and instrumentation being stronger in Q3, as Marc outlined in terms of change our guide assumptions. Vijay Kumar : Fantastic. Thanks, guys. Marc Casper : Thanks, Vijay. Stephen Williamson : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Arias of Stifel. Dan, your line is open. Please go ahead. Daniel Arias : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the questions. Marc, on the services side, I'm just curious how the Unity business is performing in light of this sort of sustained period of instrument demand that we're seeing here is acceleration something that we can expect there? Or is this more of sort of a steady-state growth rate at this point? Marc Casper : Yes. So, Dan, thanks for the question. When I think about our instrument and equipment services business, what that business is, as a reminder for our investors is, we service our fleets of instruments. We also work at pharmaceutical and biotech campuses for our customers to manage their inventory, do those activities, help them with some of the things that they need done to run their labs as well as service other people's equipment and instrumentation. So that's what we do. In general, that is a steady, nicely growing business because we've had very significant growth in the volume of our instruments over the last couple of years that becomes a trailing tailwind for the business because you have a year or so of warranty, so you don't get any additional revenue effectively. But as the warranty rolls off, that does actually drive incremental demand. So your hypothesis there is correct, but that's one that continues to strengthen at this part of the cycle. Stephen Williamson : Yes. And then, Dan, particularly on the electron microscopy business where customers can't service themselves. So you have some customers that can be efficient service from other kind of lower end instrumentation. But from electromicroscopy standpoint, they're really looking for us to step up and help them with that. So that continued, as Marc said, that continued tailwind is very significant. Daniel Arias : Yes. Okay. Helpful. And then, Stephen, while I have you, just on the variables of the equation that have changed slightly underneath an unchanged guide overall, is there anything in terms of the evolving expectations for the business units themselves. Marc may have mention of some things, some businesses that are doing better than others. So I just sort of wanted to sum that up when we think about segment trajectory and just modeling those going forward. Thanks. Stephen Williamson : Yes. I think we outlined the key changes. I think one thing that's hard for people to model is kind of where the vaccines and therapies changes. When I think about Q1 that was all in the Life Science Solutions segment. That's Biosciences business as well as Bioproduction. So from a year-over-year change, that was, I think, about an eight percentage point impact on the segment. That lessens as a headwind when I think about that going forward, but still most of that change in that revenue stream is in that segment as I think about the year as a whole. But nothing significant changing underneath other than we've already identified in terms of the overall guide. Rafael Tejada : Operator, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Of course, our final question of today comes from Puneet Souda of SVB Securities. Puneet, your line is open. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda : Hi, Marc. Good morning and congrats here. Just I'll stick to one maybe sort of 1.5 question. Capital deployment, 2022, you did two deals, PeproTech earlier in there and then Binding Site. Wondering how the outlook is looking for capital deployment this year. Maybe talk a little bit about your expectations for what you're seeing from market participants in both public and private markets. And then just briefly on the Inflation Reduction Act. Could you outline what you're hearing from your larger pharma customers? I'm wondering if they're changing how they're allocating their R&D going forward? Thank you. Marc Casper : Yes. So, Puneet, thanks for the questions. In terms of the IRA, I think customers are working through that in terms of what the implications and does that adjust any of the long-term decision making about what our preferred and what's their clinical trial strategy. We haven't seen anything material change at this point? I know there's certainly a lot of dialogue with government. I'm trying to make sure those policies do what they were intended to do. From a capital deployment perspective, this is a good environment from my perspective because you have less competition because of higher interest rates. From certainly private equity and so forth. So I think there's always competition, but I think that's good because that helps you pick and choose and get things at an appropriate valuation. So I think we'll continue to be active. Our pipeline is super busy like so I'm very excited about what we're looking at. You never know how these things actually play out in reality. But there's plenty going on and we'll be aggressive if the right transaction is available to us. So that's the benefit of the company performing well and a great track record of creating value through capital deployment. Marc Casper : So thanks for the questions. I think at this point I'll do a quick wrap up. So, thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We're very pleased to deliver a strong quarter. We're incredibly well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company. I'm looking forward to updating you on our upcoming Investor Day on May 24th. See you in New York City or virtually. And as always thank you for your support at Thermo Fisher Scientific. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

My name is Ellen, and I'll be coordinating the call for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce our moderator to the call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may now begin the call. Rafael Tejada : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investor section of our website thermofisher.com under the heading News & Events until August 11th, 2023. A copy of the press release of our second quarter 2023 earnings is available in the investor section of our website under the heading Financials. So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which is on file with the SEC and available in the Investor section of our website under the heading Financials, SEC Filings. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today. Also during this call we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our second quarter 2023 earnings and also in the Investor section of our website under the heading Financials. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thanks, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter call. Let me recap our financial performance for the quarter, then I'll provide additional context on what we're seeing playing out in the macro economy and the implications for our outlook. In the second quarter, our revenue was $10.69 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.37 billion, and we delivered adjusted EPS of $5.15 per share. As you saw in our press release, the macroeconomic environment became more challenging in the quarter. Economic activity in China slowed and across the economy more broadly, businesses became more cautious in their spend. This impacted our Q2 results and informed a more moderated view for the full-year. We're taking appropriate actions to successfully navigate these conditions. As a reminder, when we set out our guidance at the beginning of the year, we assumed core market growth would be in the normal range of 4% to 6% for 2023. Given the more challenging macroeconomic environment at this point, we think it is best to assume that these conditions will persist for the remainder of the year, and our current assumption is that core market growth will be in the 0% to 2% range this year. We're increasing our commercial intensity to help our customers through this environment and capture even more opportunities. We're also leveraging the PPI Business System to appropriately manage our costs. Given these changes, we're revising our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the full-year. I'll cover some of the key points around the guidance, and Stephen will outline our underlying assumptions later in the call. For 2023, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $43.4 billion to $44.0 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $22.28 to $22.72. As you know, during periods of change, we have a very clear set of guiding principles on how we manage the company. These principles have three elements. First, everything we do starts with our customers and ensuring that we're enabling their success. Second, we inspire our colleagues to bring their best every day to fulfill our mission. And third, we hold ourselves to an incredibly high standard to deliver differentiated short-term performance all while capitalizing on dynamic times to enhance our long-term competitive position, creating an even brighter future for our company. To enable the differentiated short and long-term performance in this environment, we're leveraging our PPI Business System to deliver $450 million of additional cost actions in 2023. That's in addition to what was embedded in our previous guidance. We're ramping up our commercial intensity to drive our share gain momentum, and we continue to invest in our capabilities to be an even stronger partner for our customers. We're uniquely positioned to help them navigate their own challenges in this environment. When I think about our proven ability to navigate market dynamics, combined with the long-term market growth drivers for the Life Sciences industry, I'm incredibly confident for the future. As I look ahead, there is a clear need for new medicines, and the scientific advances in Life Sciences are leading to exciting and innovative therapies, which will make a profound positive impact on well-being and be one of the drivers creating the very strong and durable tailwind in our industry. Let me now turn to our quarterly performance and provide you with an update on our end markets. Starting with pharma and biotech, growth was flat for the second quarter. The COVID-19 vaccine and therapy revenue run-off performed as expected during the quarter, resulting in a 5 point headwind within this market. From a segment perspective that revenue run-off is essentially all in our Life Science Solutions segment, largely in our biosciences business related to nucleotides and enzymes and to a lesser extent in bioproduction. The strongest growth in pharma and biotech end market this quarter was in our pharma services and clinical research businesses. In academic and government, we grew in the high-single-digits in the quarter. We delivered very strong growth in our electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses, as well as our research and safety market channel. In industrial and applied, we grew in the low-single-digits for the quarter. The strongest growth in this end market was in our analytical instruments businesses. And finally in diagnostics and healthcare, revenue in Q2 was approximately 20% lower than the prior year quarter. The team delivered very good core business growth during the quarter driven by our microbiology, immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostic businesses. Let me now turn to our growth strategy. We really made terrific progress in Q2 in this regard. Our growth strategy consists of three pillars : high impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers, and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar innovation. We had a really spectacular quarter. We launched high impact new products that are further strengthening our industry leadership by enabling our customers to break new ground in their important work. We had a great showing at the American Society for mass spectrometry conference, where we featured the groundbreaking Thermo Fish -- Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer, which is the most significant advancement in mass spectrometry 15-years. The Orbitrap Astral combines speed, high sensitivity, and deep proteome coverage to enable researchers to uncover proteins that previously evaded detection. This will enable breakthroughs that could lead to the development of new targeted therapies for a range of diseases, from cardiovascular disease to cancer. We've already started to deliver the Astral to our customers and we're very pleased with the strong bookings performance to-date. In our electron microscopy business, we launched the Thermo Scientific Metrios 6, scanning transmission electron microscope. The latest innovation in our leading line of instruments designed for the semiconductor industry. This fully automated system enables our customers to rapidly obtain large volume, high quality data from increasingly complex semiconductors to accelerate development. In our biosciences business, we introduced the Gibco OncoPro Tumoroid Culture Medium Kit. It accelerates development of novel cancer therapies. These kits support the culture of tumor cells derived from individual patients providing a better disease model for research and drug development that could potentially improve clinical trial success and help bring drug candidates to market faster and more cost effectively. And in specialty diagnostics, we launched the first and only immunoassay to help doctors stratify a mother's risk of developing preeclampsia, a serious complication that can develop in pregnancy in the postpartum period, endangering both mother and baby. We receive breakthrough designation and FDA clearance for assessing a patient's risk of developing severe preeclampsia enabling doctors to better manage care. These are just a few examples of the exciting innovation going on across our company, which will make a significant difference for our customers and drive future growth. The second pillar of our growth strategy is the trusted partner status that we have built with our customers. This unique relationship gives us early insights into our customers' unmet needs and enables us to bring our industry leading products, services, and expertise together in ways that no one else can. We continue to strengthen our capabilities to be an even stronger partner for our customers. For example, in our Pharma Services business, we added an early development hub at our site in Bourgoin, France enabling early development in addition to commercial manufacturing. The third pillar of our growth strategy is our unparalleled commercial engine. We have a meaningful commercial advantage, due to the deep engagement that we're able to have with our customers across the globe. A great example of our progress here is further strengthening our commercial capabilities with the opening of a state-of the-art customer center of excellence in Milan. It features a customer application development lab to showcase our industry leading products, services, and expertise. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we completed a small bolt-on acquisition of MarqMetrix, a developer of Ramen based spectroscopy solutions for in line process analytics. This technology expands our capabilities to help our customers make precise and accurate measurements throughout their manufacturing processes in a wide range of applications including biopharma. This business is a nice complement to our analytical instruments business. Let me give you a quick update on the binding site acquisitions, which we closed at the beginning of the year. Our protein diagnostics business has delivered outstanding growth and the integration is going incredibly well. Our team is progressing the innovation pipeline to advance the diagnosis and management of patients both multiple myeloma and immune disorders. And just after the close of the quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire CorEvitas, a leading provider of regulatory grade real world evidence for approved medical treatments and therapies. Real world evidence is the collection and use of data from patient health outcomes gathered through routine clinical care. This is a high growth market segment as pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers, as well as regulating bodies are increasingly looking to monitor and evaluate the safety of approved medicines and examine their effectiveness and value in a post approval setting. CorEvitas will further strengthen our capabilities to serve our pharma and biotech customers. It's an excellent strategic fit for our company and highly complementary to our clinical research business. There is strong market demand for real world evidence, which improves decision making and reduces the time and cost associated with drug development. The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of this year, and I'm very excited about what this will mean for our customers and the patients they serve. Financially, we expect the business to deliver low-double-digit growth and be accretive to adjusted EPS by $0.03 in 2024. So overall strong progress in the second quarter for capital deployment. During the quarter, we advanced our environmental, social and governance priorities including launching a partnership with Pfizer to increase local access to next generation sequencing based testing for lung and breast cancer patients in more than 30 countries across Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. These are areas where advanced genomic testing has previously been limited or unavailable. Access to local NGS testing can help to provide faster analysis of associated genes, empowering healthcare providers to select the right therapy for that individual patient. Through the partnership, we will work with local labs using our NGS technology to ensure they meet industry standards for NGS testing for breast and lung cancer. Pfizer will work to enable affordable patient access and to raise healthcare provider awareness regarding the benefits of advanced NGS testing. Together, we'll continue to evaluate additional geographic opportunities and to expand testing for other types of cancer. I'm very proud of the way we're making a difference, not only by enabling our customer success, but also by creating a better -- a great work environment for our colleagues and then making a positive impact for society. So to summarize our key takeaways from the second quarter, while the macroeconomic environment has become more challenging, our team continues to leverage our PPI business system to deliver strong productivity. We're focused on driving market share gains, and at the same time, we're advancing our proven growth strategy to be the even stronger partner for our customers. We effectively deployed capital to create significant value for our customers and our shareholders. And the attractive long-term outlook for the Life Sciences industry and Thermo Fisher is unchanged. We're incredibly well positioned to help our customers navigate the current environment, capture incremental opportunities, and exit this period, an even stronger industry leader with the very bright future. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release and as Marc just lines, the macroeconomic environment became more challenging in the second quarter. We're leveraging our PPI Business System to effectively manage these conditions. In the quarter, we delivered $10.7 billion of revenue, which included just over 2% core organic revenue growth and we delivered $5.15 of adjusted EPS. Revenue in the quarter was $300 million lower than we'd incorporated in our previous 2023 guidance. $280 million of this was related to the core business and $20 million related to testing. Approximately one-third of the change in core revenue was driven by lower economic activity in China and the remainder was driven by more cautious spending across our customer base globally, particularly in biotech. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.28 lower than when incorporated in our previous 2023 guidance, $0.07 of this was driven by FX and $0.21 by the lower revenue. Given the lower core revenue both in the quarter and assumed in our full-year outlook, we're using the PPI Business System to aggressively manage our cost base. In Q2, this enable us to offset $75 million of the profit impact of the lower-than-expected revenue, this highlights that we're actively managing the business. Let me now provide you with some more details on our performance. Beginning with our earnings results, as I mentioned, we delivered $5.15 of adjusted EPS in Q2, GAAP EPS in the quarter was $3.51. On the top line, reported revenue was 3% points lower year-over-year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue included 3% lower organic revenue, a 1% contribution from acquisitions and a slight headwind from foreign exchange. As I mentioned earlier, core organic revenue growth in the quarter was just over 2 percentage points. For context, core organic revenue growth includes the runoff in our COVID-19 vaccines and therapies revenue. Without that runoff impact, growth would have been 5% in the quarter. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the pandemic-related revenue in the current and prior year. In Q2, North America declined mid-single-digits. Europe grew in the low-single-digits and Asia Pacific declined in the mid-single-digits with China declining in the low-teens. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, a 150 basis points lower than Q2 last year. In the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity and achieved strong price realization, this was more than offset by lower pandemic-related revenue, continued strategic investments and FX. Given the change in the macro environment, we're using the PPI Business System to drive significantly more productivity this year than initially planned. We've initiated $450 million of additional cost actions. And as I mentioned earlier, we already began to see this benefit in Q2. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41%, 220 basis points lower than Q2 last year. For the quarter, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those for adjusted operating margin. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.6 of revenue, an improvement of 50 basis points over Q2 last year. Total R&D expense was $345 million in Q2, reflecting our ongoing investments in high impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 7.1% in the quarter. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest was $148 million, which is $36 million higher than Q2 last year, mainly due to capital deployment. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10%, this was 300 basis points lower than Q2 last year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. Average diluted shares were $388 million in Q2, approximately $6 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $2.3 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow was $1.5 billion after investing $730 million of net capital expenditures. During the quarter, we repaid $1 billion of senior notes and returned $135 million of capital through dividends. Shortly after the quarter end, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire core EBITDA for approximately $900 million. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and $34 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.9 times on a net debt basis. Including my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 11.9%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our pandemic-related revenue varies by segment and that revenue was higher in the prior year. So that does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins. We continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Science solutions, Q2 reported revenue in this segment declined 25%, and organic revenue was also 25% lower than the prior year quarter. This was driven by the moderation in pandemic-related revenue in the segment versus the year ago quarter and to a lesser extent, the macro factors that I described earlier. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Science solutions decreased 38% and adjusted operating margin was 33.2%, down 710 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 9% in Q2 and organic growth was 10%. The strong growth in the segment this quarter by the electron microscopy business. Q2 adjusted operating income in this segment increased 26% and adjusted operating margin was 24.7%, up 130 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity and had strong volume and mix, that was partially offset by strategic investments and FX. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics. In Q2 revenue increased 1% and organic revenue was 5% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we continue to see strong underlying growth in the Core led by our microbiology immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. This is offset by lower pandemic-related revenue versus the year ago quarter. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 22% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 26.7%, which is a 460 basis points higher than Q2 2022. During the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity and favorable business mix, which is partially offset by the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volume and strategic investments. And finally, in laboratory products and biopharma services segment, Q2 reported revenue increased 5% and organic growth was also 5%. During Q2, organic revenue growth in this segment was led by the Pharma Services and Clinical Research Businesses. Q2 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 19% and adjusted operating margin was 14.1% which is 160 basis points higher than Q2 2022. We delivered very strong productivity in the quarter, partially offset by FX and strategic investments. Let me now turn to guidance. And as Marc outlined, we're revising our full-year 2023 guidance to reflect both the more challenging macroeconomic environment and the offsetting actions that we're taking to navigate these conditions. Revenue for 2023 is now expected to be in the range of $43.4 billion to $44 billion with Core organic revenue growth in the range of 2% to 4%. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $22.28 and $22.72. For modeling purposes, our current estimate of where we're likely to end up for the year within that range is $43.5 billion of revenue rounding up to 3% Core organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $22.36. Let me provide you some additional details behind the changing guidance. Starting with revenue. Our revised guidance reflects the change in the assumption for Core organic revenue growth from 7% to a range of 2% to 4%. And it also assumes a $100 million lower testing revenue. Our Core organic revenue change is driven by two factors : a reduction in the assumed level of economic activity in China and an assumption that the more cautious spending that we saw across our customer base in Q2 will continue throughout the remainder of the year. In relation to China, at the beginning of the year, we saw positive momentum in the Chinese economy. We had previously assumed that this momentum would continue through the rest of the year. However, as the second quarter progressed, economic activity in China significantly slowed, resulting in less customer activity in the quarter. We think this is appropriate to assume this condition remains in place for the remainder of the year. With regards to customer spending patterns more broadly, in Q2 customers in our end markets began the year with somewhat cautious spending. And this is something that was not confined to our end markets, companies across most business segments were cautious with their spending given the uncertain macro conditions. This dynamic became more challenging in Q2. We previously assumed that this would lessen an impact as the year progressed, and we now think it's appropriate to assume that the cautious spending will continue through the remainder of the year. With strong commercial execution from our team, we expect to successfully navigate these macro dynamics and deliver 2% to 4% Core organic revenue growth for the year. And for context, as Marc mentioned, with the changes in the macro, we're now assuming Core market growth for our industry to be in the range of 0% to 2% for 2023, through reduction of approximately 4 percentage points versus the 4% to 6% assumed previously for market growth. When I think about the range of outcomes for the full-year, Core organic revenue growth, the largest swing factor is the extent of the budget flush at the end of the year. Should that be weaker than normal, then Core organic revenue growth would round down to 2%, and if stronger, it could round up to 4% for the year. And if China gets traction stimulating the economy, then that could also be an upside late in the year. So moving on now to profitability. As I mentioned earlier, we're using the PPI Business System to aggressively manage our cost base. We put in place $450 million of additional cost actions to limit the impact of the expected lower revenue on the P&L. This demonstrates our active management of the business. As a result, the high profitability pull through on the lower revenue is expected to be reduced to 35% in terms of how it flows through to the bottom line. Factoring in this and the updated view of FX, we now expect our adjusted operating income margin to be in the range 23.2% to 23.4% for the year. Let me provide some more additional details on the updated 2023 guidance. We're assuming that we'll deliver $300 million of testing revenue in 2023. This is $100 million lower than our prior guidance and through the half-year point we've delivered $225 million of testing revenue. Within the call, we continue to expect $500 million of vaccines and therapies revenue in 2023. This is $1.2 billion less than the prior year, a 3 percentage point impact on core organic revenue growth. Through the half year point, we delivered $365 million of vaccines and therapies related revenue. Moving on to FX, we continue to assume that FX will be a year-over-year tailwind to revenue of approximately $100 million. And then in terms of adjusted EPS, we now expect FX to be a headwind of $0.11, which is $0.05 higher than our previous guidance. The Binding Site acquisition is performing well and we now assume it will contribute approximately $260 million to our reported revenue growth for the year and $0.09 to adjusted EPS. Below the line, we continue to expect net interest expense in 2023 to be approximately $480 million. The adjusted tax rate assumption for the year has improved to 10% versus our prior guidance of 10.8%, driven by our tax planning initiatives. We're now expecting net capital expenditures will be approximately $1.7 billion, and we continue to expect the free cash flow will be $6.9 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance includes $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We continue to assume that full-year average diluted share count will be approximately 388 million shares and that we'll return approximately $540 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, a 17% increase over 2022. And as is our normal convention, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures. We've not included any operational benefit in 2023 for the acquisition of CorEvitas. When we get more clarity on the actual close date for that acquisition, we'll provide an estimate of any potential impact in 2023. To conclude, we recognize that the changing guidance is significant. We think it's appropriate given the change in the macro environment. And as we said at our Investor Day, should market growth be lower than normal? We will leverage the PPI Business System and step up productivity and that's what we've done. We're well positioned to navigate the near-term environment. And while the near-term environment may be more challenging, the long-term fundamentals supporting the growth of our end markets remains unchanged, as does the strength of our position to serve them. Now let me turn the call back over to Raf. Rafael Tejada : Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now enter the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Sykes from Goldman Sachs. Matt, your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Matt Sykes : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Maybe just starting on the guidance, just given the significant change relative to what you talked about at the Investor Day a few months ago. Could you maybe help us a little bit with where some of the biggest deltas in terms of your expectations relative to that time of the Investor Day and today, in terms of either end market or revenue segment, and specifically within China, were there certain categories or revenue segments or end markets where the weakness is more pronounced? I just kind of wanted to get a little more color the delta and expectations from the Investor Day to today? Marc Casper : Yes. So Matt, thanks for the question. In terms of the guidance change, the way that I think about let's start from the beginning of the year. I think it's the easiest place to start and we can talk about the Investor Day, right? So, you know, in terms of the market growth and the conditions there, right? Or what we're seeing is that China really slowed quite meaningfully in Q2, right? And that's actually somewhat surprising given the first quarter really started to rebound off of the zero COVID policies and there was government stimulus and all of a sudden Q2 really slowed down significantly and, you know, when I think about that. And then we're assuming that for the full-year, right, in terms that it's going to continue. We've seen customer caution, I mean, I think every business, when I say this is about life science tools and diagnostics. Businesses have been cautious this year on spend and it certainly manifested itself more meaningfully in Q2, particularly in biotech. And so when I think about it, about a point of our change in the growth outlook comes from China, about 3 points of it comes from customer caution. And within it, bioproduction is about a point or a third of the customer caution, passed back two-thirds across the rest of the business. You know, versus sort of what the analyst day and sort of, you know, the view in May, you know, we saw China certainly soft throughout the quarter. And in our business, the final month of a quarter is actually quite meaningful across all of our businesses. So while we certainly saw some customer caution in the beginning of the second quarter, June saw no bounce at all, right? So it just, you know, it's kind of flat through the -- you know, kind of flat through the quarter. So therefore, we just didn't see that view, which is why we've adjusted the outlook at this point in time. Matt Sykes : Great. That's very helpful color. Thanks, Marc. And then just for my follow-up, just on the AI segment and instruments, could you maybe just given the visibility you might have into sort of the back half this year, talk about sort of what the backlog looks like order growth and how you're feeling about sort of the moderation in instrument growth in the back half of this year that you talked about earlier this year? Marc Casper : Yes, Matt. Thanks for the question. So when I think about instruments, we obviously entered the year with a strong backlog and we entered the quarter with a strong backlog. And the 10% growth is very strong performance. Orders were definitely softer than we expected in Q2 primarily driven by China, which is a large component of the business there. And therefore, I would say we would expect that the growth rate would become more muted as the year unfolds in the analytical instruments business as we continue to work down the backlog. Thank you, Matt. Matt Sykes : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Arias from Stifel. Dan, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Dan Arias : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the questions. Stephen, on the PPI commentary and just being able to leverage that, can you expand on that a little bit? I mean, should we take that to mean just sort of pressing harder on being lean in areas where you've done that in the past? Or is that more pulling some levers that have it been fully pulled, so to speak? And then relatedly, the -- you know, the EPS guide only came in about 5% or so at the midpoint. So how do we think about mix as a factor there and how much room do you think that's left to you given the uncertainty that you're looking in the back half? Stephen Williamson : Yes. So, Dan, I'll explain on the PPI side and then I'll get onto the, kind of, EPS for you. So it's on PPI that what we do it's how we run the company. So this is about the first thing you do when you think about economic conditions being different and activity levels being different with our customers is prioritization in terms of what we're working on and deprioritize areas, which may be less important, push things out as appropriately and then make sure that we're investing in the right areas that we should be investing in and not titrating back any spending where that really matters. So it's about prioritizing where we're spending our time and what we're working on. And part of that Dan is then reduction in discretionary spending, reduction in activity levels in certain areas. And use PPI to be able to help us do that and put that into operation. We use the company scale in terms of the levers and sourcing, particularly in in-directs. You can lean on those levers when economic conditions aren't too strong and that's definitely a way of getting some of the benefits. And then when we think about the expected slightly lower volumes and we're optimizing our manufacturing operations appropriately and generally across our businesses. We're appropriately reducing headcount where that makes sense across the business. And so all of that wraps up into $450 million of benefit this year. And those actions have pretty much all been actioned right now in terms of the -- there's nothing significant to come. It's more they've taken the appropriate actions given the environment that we see. Then in terms of the back half of the year, so was your question around the phasing of EPS or the range of EPS, could you just clarify? Dan Arias : I guess it was a little bit of both. I mean, organic growth is going from high-singles to potentially low-singles and the EPS only actually came in pretty modest amount. So I was just wondering how much room you think you've given yourself, given your PPI comments whether, you know, you are -- I guess, the answer is you're comfortable with it, but how comfortable actually are you given the range of outcomes in the back half? Stephen Williamson : Yes. So we provided a range of outcomes and what you thought about what the market conditions could be and when we think about what the pull through would be on the revenue and that range of outcomes, plus the activities we're working on the cost side. I think that's an appropriate range for EPS. And then the phasing first-half, second-half, clearly, a higher adjusted operating income margin in the second-half of the year and that's really largely driven by the impact of the cost actions. So of the $450 million, $75 million impacted the first-half and you'll have $375 million of benefit in the second-half. And then revenue is a little bit more weighted and look at the year as a whole to the second-half versus the first-half. That's the other piece that drives the profitability in EPS difference. Thanks, Dan. Stephen Williamson : Yes. Okay, helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay, your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Vijay Kumar : Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Marc, maybe one on -- you know, thanks for all the color on the assumptions are on the guide change, when you look at the quarter, maybe can you talk about how things progress? I think China was down low-teens. Overall, organic -- underlying organic was 2%. But things worsened throughout the quarter. Because I think the implied guidance for the back half is low-singles to 2%-ish at the midpoint. So we're just wondering if the exit rate was around 2%-ish? Or is the back half assuming some improvement from the exit rate levels of 2Q? Marc Casper : Yes. So Vijay, in terms of the phasing of the quarter, I think really what was -- different was June saw none of the normal quarter-end pattern. So it was very similar to April and May. That -- in my many years of doing this, that's unusual, actually, where the last month isn't a big step-up in activity. That's just the sort of the pattern of the industry a bit. So our assumption for the year is effectively that the market conditions that we saw in Q2 -- in aggregate, for Q2 continues to play out for the balance of the year. And you have all sorts of different comparisons within the different businesses versus the prior year and so forth. But we felt that the 0% to 2% market growth and for us, for the full-year, the 2% to 4% core growth would be an appropriate performance. I think maybe the best color that I can give you is sort of how we think about it, right? Our best view on what happened in the market is informed by looking at all of the competitors, peers that reported in Q1. Obviously, that goes well into May. All of our internal data about what's going on in the market, our extensive dialogue with customers and the few companies that reported so far, right? So that informs the 0% to 2%. The way we think about this and the standard is -- it's our job to gain market share. We put in 2 points of growth faster than that assumption. We're going to hold ourselves to that standard, meaning if we're too conservative on the market outlook, then we will have higher expectations of what good looks like in terms of the year, but that's our best view. When you look at the script and the comments that Stephen and I made, we made no comments about share gain in Q2, because when you deliver 2% growth, we're not going to pat ourselves on the back. At least looking at the first few companies that have reported, it appears that our performance is actually quite good and that we're growing faster. There's a lot of companies yet to report, but it actually looks like on a relative basis, we actually had a solid quarter of growth. So hopefully, that gives you some context of where things are, but we're going to keep studying it and make sure we got a good handle on our performance. And when we end \u201823, that we will be proud that we navigated the environment extremely well, deliver differentiated performance and set the company up for long-term success. Vijay Kumar : That's extremely helpful color, Marc. And maybe one follow-up here. The updated guidance, is it assuming China to remain decline for the rest of the year? And what was PPI's growth in the quarter? Stephen Williamson : So Vijay, the decline will lessen on a reported basis because of the run-up in testing factor therapy is a little bit there in terms of the support of the pandemic that we did in the back half of the year last year. So we're assuming basically the same market conditions, not just China, but for the rest of the world, as well as we saw in Q2 for the remainder of the year. Marc Casper : Clinical research, double-digit growth. Thank you, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Fantastic. Thank you, guys. Marc Casper : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Brennan from TD Cowen. Dan, your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks, guys. Marc, Jets are hoping out and Rogers can navigate through a difficult schedule, certainly hope and expect you'll navigate Thermo through these more difficult macro times here. Maybe just the first one, would love to get more color on China. Could you just walk us through just more color across your major customer segments, kind of unpack, kind of how the quarter played out from that perspective? And then specifically, I would also love to hear color on bioproduction in China. Marc Casper : Yes. So in terms of China, when I think about it, we had a decline on an organic basis a little over 10%. Core was about flat in terms of it, and I'm just trying to give some flavor. So you, obviously, have the COVID testing. What we saw in China -- and it was very different than what our team expected, what we expected. And if I think about that, that's an unusual comment coming from us. Actually, our leadership team from China came to the U.S. and the opportunity to sit down and chat with what are they seeing? So -- and I'm heading over to China in a few weeks as well for a week. So it's an important market. It really does feel like it is broad economic based. And -- so we saw that across our different businesses, not limited to one. Clearly, bioproduction was soft in China. So consistent with some of the other comments that you've heard from others. But we saw the slowdown really cut across the portfolio, if you will, and it seems to be economic activity. We always assume, hey, are we doing something wrong? Are we losing share? All of those things, because I think that's sort of the PPI discipline, which is fact-based, hold yourself accountable to a high standard, at least on what we're seeing, it just feels like customers got extraordinarily cautious in China, activity slowed and it showed up across the portfolio. And while I haven't had a moment to distract myself on some fun activities, I look forward to, at some point, some football and seeing if the Jets actually make an improvement. Stephen Williamson : Dan, I can't comment on the Jets. But when I think about China, it is way broader than life science tools. This is a Chinese economy. They're clearly having problems getting that economy back up and running post-COVID. And they have a history of being able to do that. So -- but we're not counting on that for the remainder of the year as a way to frame it from a wider economic viewpoint. Thanks, Dan. Dan Brennan : And then maybe just on the end market, 4% to 6%, which you took down to 0% to 2% right now under your planning for 2023, kind of from what you see today? Is that 0% to 2% the best starting point as we think about modeling out Thermo's top line for 2024? Marc Casper : Do you want to talk a little bit about, Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Yes. So just broadly on 2024, when I think about what you need to do to model the company going forward, there's two factors. One is the jumping off point for the 2023 margins and then what's the macro conditions assumption you used for 2024. So obviously, on the macro, we're assuming that the near-term conditions stay the same throughout the remainder of the year. You will need to make your own assumption around what that market growth is for next year. We'll have more clarity on that when we get towards the end of this year and know what the macro conditions are like. So it's not macro within our industry, it's the macro in terms of the overall economic situation across the globe. So we'll have a clearer view on that towards the end of this year. As Marc said earlier, we'll hold ourselves to the standard of delivering a couple of points higher than what the market growth is when we think about that. So as you leave in what assumption you have, I think the assumption is we'll be driving a couple of points of share gain above that. And then from a margin standpoint, a normal assumption for the year, we start with 50 basis points of expansion on top of what we just ended the year. And then when you think about my guide for this year, will be some small benefit of the carryover of the cost actions into 2023 as well. So that will help you think about the margin profile for \u201824 at this point and provide you a more refined view on that when we give the guidance for \u201824 in more detail. Thanks, Dan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Derik, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Derik De Bruin : Hi, thank you and good morning. So Dan sort of asked so the question I wanted to talk to you about on \u201824. I guess, Marc, what's your view that we're not entering a more prolonged downturn in the life sciences tools market? And I'm just sort of thinking about this from a historical perspective when we've, sort of, seen some resets in the market, and it's taken a while for this to sort of like wash through the system. So it's like what's your confidence that we're not in a situation where we've got a couple -- we've got a period where the growth is going to be sort of back in that lower range? Marc Casper : Yes. So Derik, it's a great question. So if I step back from the crystal ball for the which moment and say, what's the drivers here. This is an unbelievable industry with incredible tailwinds. And even since the Analyst Day, if you look about the progress on approved medicines that are going on and the cycle that, that creates of more funding to fuel the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. It's extraordinarily encouraging for the long term, right? So when I think about 4% to 6% market growth for the long term, as bullish as ever, right, in terms of that. When I think about the dynamics, most of what is going on is around the macroeconomic environment, not the life science tools, diagnostics, pharma services, right, in terms of caution in the economy, credit availability, all of that cycle higher interest rates and, therefore, less funding going into higher growth business, all of that dynamic is a macro within our own industry, you clearly have the pandemic unwind, right, that's shaking out. And as you look at the industry's numbers, and even if you look at our numbers, the pandemic-related activity will be relatively modest this year. So most of that will have washed out in the industry this year. So when I think about \u201824, as Stephen said, it's really going to be what's the macro, not the life sciences tools macro, that I think is the big driver. Because the science can be explosive. Great things going on in pharma biotech. There'll be great new discoveries. All of that will attract funding. It's just a question of, is this a kind of a stabilization year for the economy and then it balances? That's the bull case. Or is this a more prolonged period? And then that obviously is more of the bearish case on sort of what the macro is. While we won't have a perfect crystal ball as we get into our guidance in '24, we'll have a much better sense of what the conditions are we are navigating. Hopefully, that's helpful. Derik De Bruin : Yes, it is. It is. So just a follow-up on this is, like how much of the pharma and biotech slowdown is just this digestion of the excess COVID spending? And clearly, there was frothy biotech markets and people worry about supply chain. So there was -- a lot of money that went into the system as people did this? How much is this just digesting that extra spend versus -- are you seeing new concerns? Are these customers seeing new concerns of a regulatory environment, drug pricing, patent expirations? Are you seeing any signs of slowing clinical trial activity or higher cancellations rates? Just some sort of thought on what's just a hangover period from COVID versus new trepidation in the space? Marc Casper : Sure. So Derik, the way I would think about it is, if you go back to the beginning of the year and sort of how we talked about our guidance, pharma and biotech, right, as a company, as a reminder, our core organic growth was 14% in 2022. Within that, vaccines and therapies were essentially flat. So actually, the -- whatever the stripping that out, we actually grew faster than that. Pharma Biotech, incredibly strong in 2022. Our view was, while the market would be a good end market in 2023, but given the comparisons, it would moderate meaningfully. That's not a negative comment, it's just such an oversized growth and our very strong growth in the prior year period, we knew that growth would slow. And when you look at the Q2 results, you're flat and 5 points of headwind, which actually performed literally exactly as we had forecasted for the quarter. So kind of 5% growth, excluding the sort of vaccine and therapy runoff this year. That gives you a sense of what the sort of base activity is in that market, which actually is reasonable. It's slower than some other periods. But given the comparison, it actually is a reasonable view. In terms of the color and all of those things, pharma's doing fine, right, I mean in terms of what's happening there. And it's really biotech, every quarter that funding has been a little bit more challenged or not as strong as the past, companies get more conservative, because they think about what's their runway on spending, and that really picked up in terms of the headwinds in Q2 against an incredibly difficult comparison in the prior year period. The final point I would make here is that there are some green shoots starting to happen in biotech, right? In terms of new company formation, some of the funding, actually, Q2 started to show some signs of positivity. That, obviously, takes a while to flow through the numbers. But actually, that's an encouraging data point as well. Hopefully, that level of context gives you some of how to think about it. Derik De Bruin : Great. Thanks, Marc. Marc Casper : Thanks, Derik. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal from JPMorgan. Rachel, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Rachel Vatnsdal : Perfect. Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question this morning. So I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper on that guidance kind of how you guys are bucketing where the cut was really coming from. So you said that of the 400 basis points, 1 point was really from China, 3 points were around customer spending, with one of that coming from bioproduction. So can you just give us a bit more color on where the remaining 2 points a weaker customer spend is happening? It sounds like PPD growth was strong. So where else are you seeing weakness in the portfolio? And then also from an end market perspective, is this really all just weakness in pharma biotech or is there some additional weakness in industrial, for example? Marc Casper : Yes. So when I think about customer caution, sort of, a macroeconomic view, you see that across all types of customers. So it's not limited to one segment. It's more pronounced than biotech, but we saw it in some industrial customers and certainly, we saw in some of the other customers that we serve, academic and government so forth. So it's not limited to one view. In terms of the growth where the impact and the change of growth is in the other segments, clearly, with -- our view is that the instruments business will slow in the second-half of the year. So that's probably one of the changes. And then some of the run rate activity that you would see in things like bioscience reagents or customer channels, which actually -- those are great businesses. We think customers will be a little bit more muted in spending. So it's really not pin to one area, but just a spread across the portfolio, probably with instruments feeling most of the impact. Rafael Tejada : Operator, we're ready for -- we'll take one last question. Operator : Okay, thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Jack, your line is now open. Please proceed. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask about M&A. These dynamic times, historically, have a way of creating new opportunities. There's been a few larger assets talked about in the press. Just would love to get your thoughts. Do you expect to be active if something materialized? Marc Casper : Yes. Jack, thanks for the question. So in terms of capital deployment and M&A, we've been active on return of capital, both through the increase in the dividend and the share buybacks earlier in the year. We've also been active on M&A, with closing the Binding Site to start the year. We're excited about CorEvitas. And we have a lot of firepower, and we're very active, right? I do agree with your sentiment that, in these periods, there are opportunities. So we're actively looking at a number of things. And we're only going to do transactions that fit our criteria, which is, ultimately, going to strengthen our offering from a customer perspective. It's going to clearly add shareholder value in terms of the returns that we generate from the transaction. So you'll see us be active. And whether that happens in terms of the second half of the year or into \u201824, we're certainly busy is the way I would think about it. Jack Meehan : Great. And I have one follow-up on Pharma Services. It sounds like that business grew faster than PPD this quarter. Can you talk about how the demand profile is holding up there? And I need to ask about the Tornado that hit Rocky Mount. Does that have any material impact on the market as you see it? Marc Casper : Yes. So Pharma Services, really strong performance, in terms of growth and the way you'd characterize it as accurate. So very strong growth in that business. When I think about new wins and some of the things that we're securing for the future, the team is doing a nice job of building out a strong backlog for the future. So that business is in a good spot. When I think about the Tornado that hit in North Carolina, the good news is that nobody was injured at least in our discussions with the customer and they're assessing the issues from a market perspective. And we stand ready to help our customers as we do in any situation, and we never view that as a business opportunity. We always view it as we have very material relationships with our customers. And our colleagues are there to support them, and we will support in any way that is helpful as they work through the natural disaster. So thank you, Jack, for the question. And thanks, everyone, for the questions today. Let me wrap up with -- thanks for joining us. We're very well positioned to deliver and continue to deliver differentiated performance, which we'll do. And as always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific, and we'll keep you updated on our progress. Thanks, everyone. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everybody, for joining. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a lovely rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Thermo Fisher Scientific 2023 Third Quarter Conference Call. My name is Ellen and I'll be the operator for today's call. During the presentation, all lines will be on mute. However, there will be an opportunity for a question-and-answer session at the end. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may begin the call. Rafael Tejada : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is, Marc Casper, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website thermofisher.com, under the heading News Events and Presentations until November 10, 2023. A copy of the press release of our third quarter 2023 earnings is available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials. So before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q which are on file with the SEC and available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials, SEC Filings. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any dates subsequent to today. Also, during this call, we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in the press release of our third quarter 2023 earnings and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter call. Let me recap our financial performance for the quarter and then I'll provide additional context on what we're seeing play out in the macro-economy and the implications for our guidance. In the third quarter, our revenue was $10.57 billion. Our adjusted operating income grew 8% to $2.56 billion, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin 200 basis points to 24.2% -- 24.2%, and we delivered excellent growth in adjusted EPS, achieving a 12% increase to $5.69 per share. We delivered a very strong third quarter. In the quarter, the market environment continued to get more challenging. So I thought that it would be best to update you on what we're seeing and the implications on our guidance for the full year. As a reminder, coming out of the second quarter, we assumed core market growth to be in the zero to 2% range for the year, driven by two factors, cautious customer spending and low economic activity in China. As we indicated in September, those same two factors increased in impact and we now expect core market growth to be slightly negative for the year. Our team did a good job capitalizing on the available opportunities in the quarter and we continue to expect to grow faster than the market for the full year and to once again deliver share gain in 2023. Factoring in the current macroeconomic conditions that I discussed, as well as the related increase in FX headwinds, we're revising our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for 2023. We now expect revenue to be $42.7 billion and adjusted EPS to be $21.50 per share. Stephen will outline the underlying assumptions later in the call, along with some thoughts to help frame 2024. So as I look ahead, the combination of our proven growth strategy and PPI Business System will enable us to successfully navigate dynamic times, positioning us to deliver differentiated short-term performance and simultaneously strengthening our long-term competitive position and outlook. The long-term prospect for our industry remain as bright as ever. Science continues to advance at a rapid pace and our tools are used by scientists for the most important work that they do, providing the foundation for the scientific breakthroughs they enable. And our capabilities enable the pharma and biotech industry, which is addressing so many unmet healthcare needs. Let me now turn to our Q3 revenue performance in the context of our end markets. Starting with pharma and biotech, growth declined 1% for the quarter. The COVID-19 vaccine and therapy revenue runoff performed as expected during the quarter, resulting in a headwind in this customer segment. In Q3, performance in this end-market was led by our pharma services business. In academic and government, we grew in the high single-digits in the quarter. We delivered very strong growth in our electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. In industrial and applied, growth was flat for the third quarter. Performance in this end-market was led by our electron microscopy business. And finally, diagnostics and healthcare, in Q3 revenue was approximately 20% lower than the prior-year quarter. In this end-market, the team delivered good core business growth highlighted by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology, and transplant diagnostics businesses. We made strong progress on our growth strategy in Q3. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars, high-impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers, and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with innovation, it was another great quarter for the company. We launched a number of high-impact new products across our businesses that are further strengthening our industry leadership and providing our customers with new technologies to enable breakthroughs in their work. Let me start with a brief update on the groundbreaking Thermo Scientific Astral, which we launched at the American Society of Mass Spectrometry in June. Demand has been very strong and it's great to see these instruments being so quickly adopted by our customers for their protein discovery research. In the quarter, we launched the EXENT Solution in Europe after receiving IVDR certification. It's the latest innovation from our protein diagnostics business, which as you know became part of Thermo Fisher with the acquisition of The Binding Site at the beginning of the year. EXENT complements our leading portfolio of assays that help to diagnose and monitor blood protein abnormalities related to multiple myeloma and other disorders. In our bioproduction business, we introduced the Gibco CTS Detachable Dynabeads, our next-generation Dynabeads platform to accelerate manufacturing of life-changing cell therapies. And in our electron microscopy business, we launched the Thermo Scientific Hydro Bio Plasma focused ion beam, providing high-resolution imaging along with a simplified workflow for cell biologists. And earlier this week, Time Magazine selected Thermo Fisher's preeclampsia test as one of Time's 2023 best innovation -- best inventions. As you may recall, this is the first and only immunoassay to aid in the risk assessment and clinical management of preeclampsia and it received FDA breakthrough designation and clearance earlier in the year. Now turning to the trusted partner status we've earned with our customers. This unique relationship gives us early insights into our customers' unmet needs and enables us to bring our industry-leading products, services and expertise together in ways that no one else can. We continue to strengthen our capabilities to be an even stronger partner for our customers. As you know, we've had strong demand for our biologics drug substance manufacturing capabilities. And during the quarter, we completed an expansion of our site in St. Louis, Missouri. This facility supports therapies for a wide range of diseases, including cancer, autoimmune conditions and rare genetic disorders. It features our new Thermo Scientific high-performer DynaDrive 5,000-liter single-use bioreactor, which is a significant advancement in single-use technology. The DynaDrive offers better performance and is scalable to much larger volumes than previous generation bioreactors. We also further strengthened our clinical research offering by opening a facility in Ohio to produce sample collection kits for clinical trials. This enables us to deliver customized kits to our clients and provide greater supply-chain stability to support their trucks. As always, our PPI Business System in our mission-driven culture enabled our success during the quarter. PPI engages and powers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day and it enables us to improve quality, productivity and customer regions while also helping us to navigate a dynamic environment. I am proud of our team's efforts, which resulted in strong operating margin expansion in the quarter. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to shareholders. It's been a very active year. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the Binding Site in January. The business is performing exceedingly well. During the quarter, we completed our acquisition of CorEvitas, a leading provider of regulatory-grade real-world evidence for approved medical treatments and therapies. As a reminder, real-world evidence is the collection and use of data from patient health outcomes gathered through routine clinical care. This is a high-growth market segment as pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers, as well as regulating bodies, are increasingly looking to monitor and evaluate the safety of approved medicines and examine their effectiveness and value in the post-approval setting. The business is now part of our clinical research business and it's off to a great start. Shortly after the close of the quarter, we announced the agreement to acquire Olink, a company that is accelerating proteomics. Olink's products enable leading academic researchers and the biopharmaceutical companies to gain an understanding of disease at the protein level rapidly and efficiently. Its proprietary technology Proximity Extension Assay provides high-throughput protein analysis. The acquisition of Olink underscores the profound impact that proteomics is having as our customers continue to advance life science research and precision medicine. This technology is highly complementary to our leading mass spectrometry and life sciences platforms, and we're uniquely positioned to rapidly bring this technology to customers. We expect to deliver $125 million in adjusted operating income synergies in year five, driven by revenue synergies and cost efficiencies. We expect this business to be a mid-teens revenue growth business for us well into the future. The transaction is targeted to be closed by mid-2024, subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals. So, 2023 has been an active year of M&A that further strengthened Thermo Fisher Scientific for the future. During the quarter, we continued to advance our environmental, social and governance priorities. This included launching a collaboration with the National Minority Quality Forum, a not-for-profit research and education organization to help bring clinical research to historically underserved patient populations through their alliance or representative clinical trials. The collaboration supports pharma and biotech customers in meeting regulatory expectations to enroll and retain patients in clinical trials, who more fully reflect real-world populations experiencing the disease or health condition being studied. And it also helps to enable our customers to meet US Food and Drug Administration requirements around diversity action plans. In terms of our environmental sustainability efforts, we've officially surpassed our original goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030. As we previously announced, we've increased our target to a 50% reduction by 2030, and we're well on our way to achieving that goal. I'm very proud of the way we're making a difference, not only by enabling our customer success but also by creating a greater work environment for our colleagues and making a positive impact for society. So to summarize our key takeaways from the third quarter. We delivered a strong operating performance in Q3, driven by our team's execution and the power of our PPI Business System. Given the more challenging macroeconomic environment, we're taking the right actions and appropriately managing the company, and we're incredibly focused on delivering differentiated short-term performance while simultaneously strengthening our long-term competitive position and outlook. The attractive long-term outlook for the life sciences industry remains unchanged and we're uniquely positioned to help our customers navigate the current environment, capture incremental opportunities and exit this period an even stronger industry leader with a very bright future. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release and as Marc just outlined, while the macroeconomic environment became more challenging in the third quarter, we continued to deliver differentiated performance. In Q3, we delivered $10.6 billion of revenue, which included 1% core organic revenue growth. Our PPI Business System enabled us to generate 200 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and we delivered $5.69 of adjusted EPS, a 12% increase over Q3 last year. We're continuing to successfully navigate the current environment. Let me now provide you with some additional details on our performance, beginning with our earnings results. As I mentioned, we delivered $5.69 of adjusted EPS in Q3. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.42. On the top line, reported revenue was 1% lower year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue included 3% lower organic revenue, 1% contribution from acquisitions and a tailwind of 1% from foreign exchange. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the pandemic-related revenue in the current and prior year. In Q3, North America declined mid-single digits, Europe grew in the low single-digits, Asia-Pacific declined in the low single-digits with China declining in the high single-digits. With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 8% and adjusted operating margin was 24.2%, 200 basis points higher than Q3 last year. In the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity and achieved good price realization. This is partially offset by lower pandemic-related revenue, continued strategic investments and FX. The strength of our productivity reflects the impact of our PPI Business System. It's enabling us to manage our cost base appropriately given the macro conditions. Total Company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 42%, 30 basis points higher than Q3 last year. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 14.8% of revenue, an improvement of 140 basis points over Q3 last year. Total R&D expense was $320 million in Q3, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 6.7% in the quarter. Looking at our results below the line for the quarter, our net interest expense was $113 million, which is similar to Q3 last year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10%, which is 180 basis points lower than Q3 last year, reflecting results of our tax planning activities. Average diluted shares were 388 million in Q3, approximately 7 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $4.7 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow was $3.7 billion, after investing $1 billion of net capital expenditures. During the quarter, we returned $136 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and we deployed just over $900 million of capital for the acquisition of CorEvitas. We ended the quarter with $6.2 billion in cash and $35.3 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2 times gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and 2.7 times on a net-debt basis. In concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 12%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company. I'll now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our pandemic-related revenue varies by segments and that revenue was higher in the prior year. So that does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins. Let me continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address inflation. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q3 reported revenue in this segment declined 18% and organic revenue was 19% lower than the prior year quarter. This is driven predominantly by the run-off of our pandemic-related revenue in the segment versus the year-ago quarter. Q3 adjusted operating income for Life Sciences Solutions decreased 16% and adjusted operating margin was 35.9%, up 80 basis points versus the prior-year quarter. During the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity and had favorable FX, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume mix. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 8% in Q3 and organic growth was also 8%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was led by our electron microscopy business. In this segment, Q3 adjusted operating income increased 21% and adjusted operating margin was 26.7%, up 290 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity and had strong volume pull-through, which is partially offset by FX and strategic investments. Turing to Specialty Diagnostics, in Q3 reported revenue increased 2% and organic revenue was 6% lower than the prior-year quarter. In Q3, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core, led by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology and transplant diagnostics businesses. This was offset by lower pandemic-related revenue versus the year-ago quarter. Q3 adjusted operating income for Specialty Diagnostics increased 29% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 26.1%, which is 550 basis points higher than Q3 2022. During the quarter, we delivered a favorable volume mix and very strong productivity. That was partially offset by the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volume and strategic investments. Finally, in Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, Q3 reported revenue increased 3% and organic growth was 1%. During Q3, organic revenue growth in this segment was led by the pharma services business. In this segment, Q3 adjusted operating income increased 29% and adjusted operating margin was 16.4%, which is 340 basis points higher than Q3 2022. During the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity and a favorable mix, which is partially offset by FX. Let me now turn to guidance. As Marc outlined, we're revising our full-year 2023 guidance to reflect the more challenging macroeconomic environment. Our revised estimate for 2023 is revenue of $42.7 billion with core organic revenue growth of just under 1%, and $21.50 of adjusted EPS. Let me now provide you with some details behind the changing guidance versus the estimate we provided on our last earnings call. Starting with revenue, our revised guidance is $850 million lower than the prior outlook. $200 million of this is driven by an increased headwind from FX. We've increased our guide by $45 million to reflect the acquisition of CorEvitas, and the rest of the change is due to our lower core revenue assumption. We now see core organic growth for the year of just under 1%, which is a little less than 2% lower than the prior guide. This is driven by the same factors that we've seen throughout the year, the weak economic conditions in China and cautious spending in general across our customer base. And as we indicated during Q3, these factors increased in impact during the quarter and our assumption is that the conditions we saw at the end of Q3 will continue throughout the remainder of the year, and as a result, we now expect core market growth for our industry to be slightly negative for the year. However, we continue to effectively navigate the macro-dynamics and expect to continue to deliver differentiated core organic revenue growth for the year despite the more challenging conditions. Moving on to profitability. The revised guidance assumes a pull-through on the lower revenue of just over 40%, and we now expect our adjusted operating margin to be 22.9% for the year. We continue to use the PPI Business System to manage our costs appropriately given the market conditions. From an adjusted EPS standpoint, the revised guidance is $0.17 lower due to FX and $0.69 related to the change in core revenue. So we now expect to deliver $21.50 of adjusted EPS in 2023, a strong result given the challenging macro-environment. Let me now provide you with some additional details of the updated 2023 guidance. We continue to assume that we'll deliver $300 million of testing revenue in 2023. We expect the total vaccines and therapies-related revenue will be $1.6 billion less than the prior year, an impact of over 4% on our core organic revenue growth. This assumes we recognized $1.3 billion of vaccine therapies revenue in 2023, $600 million of which is in our clinical research business. Moving on to FX. Given recent rate changes, we're now assuming that FX will be a year-over-year headwind to revenue of approximately $100 million. And in terms of adjusted EPS, we now expect FX to be a year-over-year headwind of $0.28 which is $0.17 more of a headwind than our previous guidance. The Binding Site and CorEvitas acquisitions are performing well, and we now assume that they'll contribute approximately $300 million to our reported revenue growth for the year. Below the line, we now expect just under $500 million of net interest expense in 2023, a slight increase reflecting the acquisition of CorEvitas. We continue to assume that the adjusted tax rate for the -- 2023 will be 10%, and we're now expecting net capital expenditures will be between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion. And we now expect the free cash flow will be between $6.7 billion and $6.9 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance includes $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January, $3.7 billion in acquisitions completed this year, and $3.1 billion committed to the acquisition of Olink, which we expect to close in 2024. We continue to assume that full-year average diluted share count will be approximately 388 million shares, and then we'll return approximately $540 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, a 17% increase over 2022. So before I conclude my prepared remarks, I thought it'd be helpful to share some more detailed thoughts around how to frame 2024. At this point in time, a good starting assumption is that our core organic revenue growth in 2024 is similar to 2023, approximately 1% growth. With our proven growth strategy, we expect to continue to take share and that would mean market growth in 2024 will be similar to 2023 with the market declining 1 to 2 points. In terms of phasing of our core organic revenue growth, it's best to assume a more challenging first half and then moderate growth in the second half. The pandemic-related revenues both testing and total vaccines and therapies are likely to be around $300 million in 2024. This is a headwind of approximately $1.3 billion, or 3% of revenue. M&A is expected to increase revenue $175 million year-over-year. That's a combination of six months of Olink, and the inorganic portion of the CorEvitas revenue in 2024. And based on current rates, we would expect FX to be a headwind to revenue in 2024 of approximately $375 million, just under 1%. So wrapping all this together, 2024 revenue dollars will be very similar to 2023. In terms of adjusted operating income dollars, with this top-line setup, we would expect to deliver similar adjusted operating income dollars through 2023. We'll continue to use the PPI Business System to manage costs very carefully but also continue to make the right long-term investments to enable us to continue to strengthen our industry leadership. Strong underlying productivity and cost controls are expected to offset the run-off in the remaining pandemic revenue, inflation and the normalization of incentive compensation across the company and appropriate investments in our colleagues. Below-the-line and the interest income benefit from our cash generation and an assumption of $3 billion of buybacks in 2024 would more than offset the impact of a slight increase in our tax rate to 10.5%. All of this would enable us to deliver around $21.75 of adjusted EPS for the year. So the high-level summary is that with these assumptions, we'd expect 2024 core organic revenue growth to be similar to 2023. And then our proven growth strategy in PPI Business System would enable us to continue to manage the macro conditions and the run-off in pandemic revenue very effectively, so we can deliver revenue and profitability similar to 2023 and a slight increase in adjusted EPS. Now, should the market conditions be better than I just outlined, our growth strategy and proven execution capabilities will enable us to deliver the upside benefit. I look forward to providing you a formal guidance for 2024 on our next earnings call along with our usual supporting details for the year ahead. At that point, we'll have the insight from a full year of 2023, we'll have a better view on the macro conditions entering 2024. So in conclusion, we continue to navigate the environment really well, delivering differentiated financials and further strengthening our industry leadership. We remain really well-positioned to capitalize on additional opportunities as market growth normalizes over time. And as we think about our cost base, we're really well-positioned to drive strongly accretive growth going forward. Now let me turn the call-back over to, Raf. Rafael Tejada : Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now enter our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Jack, your line is now open. Please proceed. Jack Meehan : Good morning, and thank you for all the color. Marc, a bigger-picture question. Upon greater reflection, how much of your decision to raise the long-term target to 7% to 9% do you think may have been based on the environment we're in? And I was curious, do you think it's prudent for investors to think of something lower than that in the medium term? Marc Casper : Yeah. Jack, thanks for the question. When I think about the long-term guidance or our long-term targets, what's underlying it is 4% to 6% growth, right? I don't think there is any controversy -- market growth -- 4% to 6% market -- I don't think there is any controversy that we're going to grow meaningfully faster because if you look at the last 10 or 15 years, we've delivered superior organic growth and it keeps getting better and better relative to the market, right. So, the spread of 2, 3 points better than that, that's not in question, right, so at 4% to 6%, you get to the 7% to 9%. When I think about my 20-plus years in this industry, thinking about what the historical growth is, what the drivers are for the growth, I feel 4% to 6% long-term market growth is actually the appropriate number that the things that the industry are going through now do not change my view that the long-term health of this industry is exceptionally bright and that you will see that return. And I can't call when exactly that returns, but what I can say is that the unmet healthcare needs and all the drivers that we talked about at our Analyst Day remain extraordinarily bright for the future. So thank you, Jack. Jack Meehan : Thanks. And then maybe as a follow-up. The deterioration, kind of, in the market we've seen since second quarter earnings or even early September, what are you hearing from customers, like, as you try and diagnose what's happening here? And just what are your thoughts on kind of the recent increase in the 10-year -- how does that impact kind of the pace of the recovery as you see it? Marc Casper : Yeah. So I've been out with customers. As you know, I do that a lot. I've been out on a definitely out there with our customer tour, both in Europe and the US, and earlier in the quarter, I was in China. So when I think about what our customers are saying, they are actually very bullish on the mid to long term, right? So there's quite a lot of opportunities for us. What I would say is short term, if you're visiting a smaller biotech customer, what you're seeing is concerns about when the funding environment is going to improve. So there's a level of caution. And I think that's generally across the customer base as customers are being cautious after a very robust pandemic period. But long term and the excitement and customers looking forward to the future with us, it's extremely positive. Anything on the non-term interest rate? Stephen Williamson : No, I wouldn't think about the long-term interest rate. I think from a funding standpoint, I think there's a spread between interest rates and then what the kind of return we people are going to get on an investment. And as the valuation expectations moderate for our customers, that, I think the funding will start flowing better going forward. The timing of that will still be played out, but the return profile and the successful investment in biotech is still incredibly compelling. So long term, that will moderate appropriately. Rafael Tejada : Thanks, Jack. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Jack. Our next question comes from Dan Brennan from TD Cowen. Dan, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Dan Brennan : Thank you. Thanks for the questions, guys. Maybe, Marc and Steve -- Stephen, excuse me, it's somewhat hard to reconcile just the magnitude of this end-market weakness just given the view towards the structural attractiveness of the -- kind of the customer drivers. So maybe could you just give us a lens on this outlook for '24, maybe first from like a geographic perspective China, how much of is that a driver towards like other reasons? And then B, it would be great to just learn about like within biopharma, your largest customer base, maybe some of the underlying factors that kind of pointed as very weak growth in bioprocess, pharma R&D. Marc, you just mentioned pre-commercial biotech. Just give us a little more color on what's driving you know the real, kind of, contracted growth outlook. Marc Casper : Yeah. So, Dan, thanks for the question. I think the way that Stephen and I thought about giving an early view to 2024 is not based on us having finished our operating plan process which we do in December, and then when we actually lay out guidance, we do it based on how did the year finish, all of the details by business, by geography and then we figure out the details. We took the benefit of each of us having 20-plus years of experience in the industry, looking at the market conditions that we see today, and basically went through the assumptions of how could 2024 play out based on what we know today, right? So this is not a bottoms-up view by country, by geography and by business unit, but rather based on experience and based on what we're seeing. So when I think about for us next year, all right, we try to give you incredible clarity about what's COVID in our numbers, right? So we're expecting a run-off of $1.3 billion of COVID-related revenue in 2024, that would leave $300 million of revenue in 2024, of which we have a pretty good line-of-sight to what those activity is, right? So that's the first assumption. And then the second assumption is effectively what's going on in the base business, meaning, excluding the COVID-related business, and that should be a little bit over 3% growth, right? So if you think of those two factors, that's how you get to a core number of one. Remember that testing is part of the decline. So that's the set of assumptions. So then there is another lens to think about it, which is comparisons, right, or the -- we're going to lap the customer caution, different businesses at different points in time, but the first half will have more difficult comparisons, haven't fully seen the effect of caution. The second half, you actually get to more --you're back to kind of moderate growth in that period of time just based on that factor. And then we look at some of our businesses like our insurance business, which had the benefit this year of the disruptions from supply-chain in 2021 and 2022, and we're able to catch-up on orders that needed to be shipped and that gave us a little bit of a benefit of growth this year, of which, that obviously doesn't repeat next year. We factored all that in and we said, core is pretty similar to what it is next year. We look forward to actually doing the detailed guidance at the end of January, early February when we have our earnings call, and we'll have all of our puts and takes and be a lot smarter. But we wanted our analyst community to be aligned with what we're seeing today because there's quite a big disconnect in the numbers that are out there for 2024 relative to the numbers that we articulated today. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks, Marc. Maybe just a follow-up on biopharma since it's\u2026 Marc Casper : Thanks, Dan. Dan Brennan : I'm sorry about that. Maybe just a follow-up on biopharma since it is your biggest customer base and such a key driver. Could you just give us a little bit of a window, just maybe what you're seeing in Q3, kind of how you're thinking about Q4 is maybe a jumping-off point for '24, large pharma R&D spending, bioprocess, PPD? Can you give us some flavor on your key customer segments and kind of what the trends look like right now, and that will give us some vantage point for how we think about '24 there as well? Thank you. Marc Casper : Dan, I think your fellow analysts are throwing tomatoes at your building today. You're asking 19 questions in that one, but I'll start at a high level and leave some of this for others. Let me break the pharma -- biopharma into what revenue was in Q3 and then a little bit of -- some of the underlying dynamics. Actually, the revenue in the quarter was incredibly similar to the prior quarter, right, in terms of how we actually performed. We declined 1%. And looking at that, the long-term outlook here is strong. We talked about that in an earlier question. Effectively, customer caution increased a bit. You'll see that more pronounced in biotech and pharma, but you see it across the customer set. That's more of a forward-looking look. I think the thing that probably is most relevant and why we think about our fourth quarter the way we do, one of the things that we assumed in our previous guidance was that in our bioprocessing business, that orders would stabilize, start to normalize in the third quarter. We did not see that, right? Obviously, what's the single biggest driver of the same factors in Q4 versus what we talked about really is bioproduction. We didn't see that normalization of orders. In general, that business operates on a roughly 13-week lead time. So if you don't see the orders in Q3, you're not going to see the revenue step-up in Q4. So hopefully that's helpful in terms of framing. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get some of the other ones in future questions. Operator : Thank you, Dan. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Derik, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Derik de Bruin : Hi. Thank you, and good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Marc, you just typically haven't called out COVID impact to PPD -- the biopharma services business in the past. Can you just sort of clarify what that was in '22 and '23 overall so we can get the number? And also staying on that segment, Pfizer and Moderna are big customers of yours. They both sort of announced some R&D cuts. How should we sort of think about how that flows through the business? And I guess is there any sort of like vaccine revenues that in that business, were there any sort like take or pays that are sort of in there? So I know it's a lot on that, but just start there. Marc Casper : Yeah. So they're great questions. So let's talk about clinical research one level above and then I'll give you some of the answers to the question you have. All right. So we are almost at the two-year anniversary of the acquisition of PPD, which closed in early December of 2021. Business is doing great, right, and it's been a terrific acquisition. It is a terrific acquisition with a bright future. If you think about what the moment-in-time was in December of 2021, PPD had done a great job of growing its core sort of normal business and played a leading role in supporting the clinical trials for vaccines and therapies, just a phenomenally relevant set of capabilities, which is part of the reason we knew how great the business was and how respected it was in the industry. Since our ownership, we've modeled in that this would be a declining portion of the business. It's actually been a headwind through all of our ownership on core organic growth, right? So if I think about -- so our core organic would actually been higher than if we didn't include it. But our view was, this business' end-market growth was really good and we're just going to grow through it and it was factored into our guidance. Obviously, as customer caution has increased in pharmaceutical and biotech, the rates of growth in our non-COVID business slows. And we wanted to ensure that our investors understood that that was actually quite healthy, but we're going through the run-off on vaccines and therapies. To give you the magnitude of the number, what is embedded in our 2023 is a $600 million decline in revenue for vaccines and therapies, and it also happens to be $600 million of activity in the year. So that's this year, and as opposed to sort of take or pay or those things, clinical trials are different, but you have patients enrolled, you go through it. So that revenue will run off in an orderly fashion over the next couple of years in the outlook that we gave of $300 million of total revenue for all pandemic related. Some of that -- most of it is actually that work in clinical research. There's a little bit of take or pay in pharma services and nominal amount of testing. So hopefully that gives you a good sense of the dynamic there. Derik de Bruin : Right. So if we just think about underlying growth of the core PPD business, just sort of like, what's your embedded number for this year, and sort of like the working assumption for next year? Just, as I said, there's just a lot of variables. I think just some clarity would help. Marc Casper : Yeah. So obviously, we'll get into some of that. We don't even do it by business unit in our guidance. So -- but I can give you sort of direction how to think about it. What we have said at the time of the acquisition and what we've said consistently is the long-term growth expectation for this business is high-single-digits plus the benefit of synergies. And that hasn't changed in terms of the long term. Our assumption has been that it would step down from the 20% and then sort of double-digit growth to that, and then actually it will step down below that and bounce back up just on the math of the COVID -- the COVID activity run-off over the next year or so. So hopefully, that helps in terms of how to think about modeling it. Derik de Bruin : Yeah. Marc Casper : Thanks, Derik. Derik de Bruin : Then just one more if I can. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal from J.P. Morgan. Rachel, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Rachel Vatnsdal : Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. So appreciate all the color that you've given us today on 2024, but for two areas that I wanted to follow up on. First, how do you see China playing out next year? At this point, is growth in the region going to be reasonable in 2024? Are we going to be looking at declines? And now you've noted that 2024 is also going to be more of a back-half weighted story given those market dynamics. So could you walk us through the magnitude of the step-up that you're expecting between the first half and second half? And how much of that is really going to be driven by easier comps in the back half versus an expected rebound in the market? Marc Casper : So, Rachel, thanks. Let me start with China. And I think it's really relevant for the community to understand our view on what's going on in China, right? So first of all, it was great to return to China, which I did in August. And actually came away with -- and way more encouraged on the long term. So let me give you a little bit more detail on it. I went to China with two different hats. One is the Chair of the US-China Business Council, where I had the opportunity to interact with senior members of the Chinese government, including the premier. And then I also did my normal thing of being CEO of Thermo Fisher Scientific and had the opportunity to see our colleagues, visit sites and see a lot of customers during that process. So this is what I came away with from my visit. Economy is definitely challenged, and the conditions are worsening, and we saw that worsening during the quarter. The government is actively working to boost business confidence and create a stronger environment for foreign investment. So when I think about the kind of the macro picture, short-term, definitely a challenge from a macro-economy. I was pleasantly surprised that a real focus on a better environment for foreign companies, which bodes well for the future. When I think about the outlook here, we definitely saw the impact of the declining economy in the results and we would expect that that will continue. And we can't predict exactly when the market will do. But we know that the comparisons get easier in the second half for China as we lap some of the comparables -- or the more challenging comparables. When I think about phasing for the year and all of all of that stuff, we look forward to doing that in beginning of 2024. Stephen Williamson : Yeah. But, Rachel, that kind of set up what I put in the prepared remarks, is kind of a mirror image of this year as a starting point, kind of more challenging in the first half and then modest growth in the second half. Thanks, Rachel. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. And then if I could squeeze one more just on instrumentation. That was a great spot this quarter at 8% growth. You've noted that you're over-indexed to instrumentation in China, and you've also highlighted some of the incremental weakness there. So can you just walk us through what exactly you're seeing in that portfolio? What was instrument growth in China versus rest of world? And then how should we think about that setup for instrumentation next year given you're going to face some of these difficult comps in the first three quarters? Marc Casper : So I'll probably keep it at a pretty high level. Awesome quarter in Analytical Instruments, 8% growth. Team is doing a good job. Our electron microscopy business, really performing extremely well. And great to see the uptake on Astral, which is our breakthrough mass spectrometer, which we launched in June. So those are the highlights. Our guidance for this year and our framing for next year reflects the customer caution and the non-repeat of some of the -- working through the disruptions of the pandemic on supply chain. So that's embedded in the outlook for the year. Stephen Williamson : And then Rachel, just on the kind of the additional kind of weakness we saw in China in Q3, some of that came through in revenue in Q3, but it's going to be more in terms of revenue in Q4 because of a lag in terms of bookings profile for an instrumentation business. So that's part of that dynamic of why Q4 is more impacted by the change profile that we saw in China. Rafael Tejada : Thanks, Rachel. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Puneet, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda : Yeah. Thanks, Marc, Stephen. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll wrap two of my questions into one. First, largely on M&A. Given the environment right now, the type of deals that you're doing, the type of valuations you're doing at, could you maybe just give us a sense of what you're seeing out there? Obviously, Olink, prior to that Binding Site and CorEvitas. Is that the type of sort of midsized deals that we should continue to expect here and the opportunity base that you are seeing in M&A? And within the proteomics franchise, now with successful Orbitrap franchise of last 15-plus years, combining that with Olink, Marc, maybe at a high level, could you provide us your, not for lack of better word, vision on proteomics despite being a sort of a tough market this year and next year? Marc Casper : Yeah. So Puneet, thanks for the question. And, so when I think about the M&A for this year or M&A even in general, the criteria that we use, right, is M&A that's going to be highly valued by our customers, strengthen our strategic position, generate strong returns for our shareholders. And you look at what the different opportunities are and you think about it in different periods of time where it's going to skew in your favor. And this year, with a more volatile macro, we've been able to add three phenomenal businesses, right, in terms of strengthening the company with incredible growth prospects, really good return profiles. So that doesn't mean that next year will look exactly like this or years where you can buy companies that are really more of a balance of cost and revenue growth in those different things and different aspects of it. But this year, to be able to get the Binding Site, CorEvitas and Olink, it's fantastic. And when I think about Olink, which, this is our first opportunity given that we had announced it during a blackout period, it's just a terrific fit, right, and you think about it's a leader in a business that has gone through that phase of being well adopted, right? So the technology risk isn't here anymore. But it hasn't globally commercialized. It hasn't reached nearly its full potential and incredibly complementary to our leading position in mass spectrometry and proteomics. And Puneet, thanks for reminding others about our 15-year plus track record with Orbitrap. Astral being the next big many year run and the combination there, plus Olink, and the fact that we have a leading position in the life sciences instrumentation, which are very relevant in terms of qPCR for these products as well. Really exciting. They are a leader in their field and we're excited to help bring that to the customer base in an accelerated fashion. And when we look to the future, we expect this to be a long-term, mid-teens-plus growth business and be able to generate really significant adjusted operating income synergies driven by that accelerated revenue growth, right? And on top of that, just $125 million of earnings that come from the year five synergies, and that's going to generate double-digit returns for the shareholders. So super exciting time, and we'll continue to be outstanding stewards of our shareholders' capital. Puneet Souda : Great. Thank you. Marc Casper : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eve Burstein from Bernstein. Eve, your line is now open. Please proceed. Eve Burstein : Hi, there. Good morning, and thanks a lot for the question. I'd love to ask about your lab products and biopharma services business unit. So the operating margin there was up right at 16%. It was higher than any point in the past. And when you talk about the puts and takes there, you called out productivity and mix as some of the positive drivers. So just two questions there. One, on mix, if that was a positive driver, does that actually mean that sales of some of your really low margin consumables were down? Other peer companies have talked about challenges there and brought down guidance in general lab products. So can you talk a little bit about those dynamics? And then secondly, on productivity gains, what is driving that? And are those going to be sustainable and recurring over time? Stephen Williamson : So, it\u2019s Steve. Thanks for the question. So when I think about the margin dynamic in that segment, yeah, mix is -- when you think about where the more challenging environment is in terms of customer caution and China, that impacts the lab products business and then the wider customer caution also impacts our channel business, so relative to the other business in that segment, where the mix profile comes from. In terms of productivity, it's about -- we've been rightsizing the cost base within our lab products business and given the volume change. So that's where the majority of that is. And then just good spending wisely across the whole business, but those are probably the two main factors to call out. Thanks, Eve. Eve Burstein : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Rafael Tejada : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Perfect. We will take our last question today from Dan Leonard from [UBS] (ph). Dan, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you for the time and really appreciate you sharing all those framing thoughts for 2024. I have a couple of additional follow-ups on that but I'll keep it to one. I know it's not a bottoms-up view, but I'm curious how you're thinking about the inventory effect either for your business or the market in 2024. In those areas where there's been inventory burn-down in 2023, whether it be in bioproduction or the channels business or wherever you're seeing it, what do you think is a reasonable assumption for 2024? Is it reasonable to assume the burn-down concludes and demand can match customer usage? Just any high-level thoughts. Thank you. Marc Casper : So good question. When I think about the -- it's primarily a bioproduction story. And I don't think anyone is smart enough to know exactly which quarter. But during 2024, do I think that we will get back to orders matching revenue at some point during the year? Yeah. So I think that we'll be smarter with the benefit of another three months of time to see what our view is on 2024. But I don't think we'll be talking throughout the year about inventory reduction in the customer side because there's activity that's going on currently that's consuming the inventory that's out there. Great. So let me bring to just a quick wrap up for the call. Thank you for joining us today. We're very well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance. And as always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. We look forward to updating you in the new year. Operator : That concludes today's conference for everybody. Thank you very much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great rest of your day.",

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc N. Casper: Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call. As you saw in our press release, our fourth quarter results were ahead of the guidance we provided on our call in October and demonstrates strong execution. As I reflect on our performance for the full year, I'm very proud of our team as they operated with speed at scale to enable the success of our customers while demonstrating incredibly strong operational disciplines and commercial execution. In 2023, we delivered differentiated short-term performance while at the same time strengthening our long-term competitive position.  I'll get into more detail in my remarks later, but first, let me recap the financials. Starting with the quarter, our revenue was $10.89 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.55 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points to 23.4% and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, growing adjusted EPS 5% to $5.67 per share. Then in terms of our full year results, our revenue was $42.9 billion in 2023, adjusted operating income was $9.81 billion and adjusted EPS was $21.55 per share. Last year, we once again delivered meaningful share gain with our industry-leading products, services, and expertise. We leveraged our PPI business system to enable outstanding execution, including aggressively addressing our cost base to effectively navigate a challenging macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we strengthened our long-term competitive position with high-impact innovation, exciting and complementary acquisitions, additional investments in our capabilities, and further strengthening our trusted partner status with our customers.  Turning to our performance by end market, in the fourth quarter, underlying market conditions largely played out in line with our expectations. Our continued strong execution resulted in revenue performance that was slightly ahead of our expectations. Now let me provide you some color on our performance in the context of each of our end markets. Starting with pharma and biotech, as expected, growth declined in the high single digits for the quarter and approximately 1% for the full year. In 2023, vaccine and therapy runoff resulted in a seven-point headwind in this customer segment, which was effectively offset through share gains as a result of our trusted partner status. We've made strong progress in transitioning COVID-related capacity to other therapies, and that's very exciting for the future. In academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digits for the quarter and in high-single digits for the full year. In 2023, we delivered strong growth across a range of our businesses, including electron microscopy, chromatography, and mass spectrometry, as well as the research and safety market channel. In industrial and applied, we grew in the low single digits for both the quarter and for the full year. During the year, we delivered very strong growth in our electron microscopy business. And finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, in Q4, revenue declined in the high teens and was 30% lower for the full year. In 2023, we delivered good core business growth in this end market, highlighted by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology and transplant diagnostic businesses.  I'll now turn to an update on our growth strategy. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars, high impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers, and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar, it was another terrific year of high-impact innovation. Throughout the year, we launched outstanding new products across our businesses that strengthened our industry leadership by enabling our customers to advance their important work. In chromatography and mass spectrometry, the year was highlighted by the launch of the groundbreaking Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral Mass Spectrometer, which is helping our customers uncover proteins that were previously undetectable. The scientific breakthrough is enabling customers to advance precision medicine, including the identification of new clinical biomarkers. In the six months since launch, the scientific community's adoption of the product has exceeded our high expectations and the momentum is continuing to build as we enter 2024.  In electron microscopy, we launched the Thermo Scientific Metrios 6 S/TEM, a fully automated system that enables our customers to rapidly obtain large volume, high quality data from increasingly complex semiconductors to advanced development. In specialty diagnostics, we launched the first FDA-cleared assays for the risk assessment and clinical management of preeclampsia. This first-of-a-kind diagnostic has received significant attention and adoption as it has significantly raised the standard of care for pregnant women, helping physicians to better manage care by predicting who is most at risk for this condition.  In Life Sciences Solutions, we introduced the Gibco CTS Detachable Dynabeads, our next generation Dynabeads platform to accelerate manufacturing of life-changing cell therapies. We continued this great innovation momentum in the fourth quarter. In electron microscopy, we launched the Thermo Scientific Meridian EX System for precise defect localization in advanced logic semiconductors. And in low laboratory products we launched the Thermo Scientific Aquanex Ultrapure Water Purification System for reliable water purity and operational enhancement in laboratories. So another spectacular year of innovation and an exciting pipeline for the future.  In 2023, we also continued to strengthen our industry-leading commercial engine and the trusted partner status we have earned with our customers. This included the opening of a state-of-the-art customer center of excellence in Milan to showcase our industry-leading product services and expertise. And during the fourth quarter, we further strengthened our position in advanced materials by opening a customer experience center for battery manufacturing in Seoul to accelerate the development of next generation of environmentally friendly energy solutions. We also made significant advancements in the partnerships and collaborations with our customers throughout the year. Building on our longstanding relationship with Borenger Ingelheim, a great example in the fourth quarter was an exciting opportunity to develop a genomic testing-based companion diagnostic for non-small cell lung cancer patients in Japan and the United States, where lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death.  Now let me turn to our PPI business system and our mission driven culture, which continued to enable successful execution during the year. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day. It's helping us to drive share gain, improve quality, productivity, and customer allegiance. I'm proud of the way our team leveraged PPI to step up in an agile way to navigate the dynamic environment last year, driving higher commercial intensity, actively managing our cost base, and optimizing sourcing. We're also leveraging generative AI as part of our PPI business system toolkit to increase productivity, further optimize our commercial effectiveness, and improve the customer experience.  A quick recap on capital deployment last year. We continued to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In terms of M&A, we completed our acquisition of the binding site, our protein diagnostics business which enhances our specialty diagnostics offering by advancing the diagnosis and management of patients with multiple myeloma and other immune disorders. The integration has gone smoothly and the business is performing extremely well and tracking ahead of the deal model. As we look to the future of the protein diagnostics business, our launch of EXENT instrument solution represents a significant breakthrough given its enhanced sensitivity, specificity, and ease of use when compared to conventional methods. This is a great complement to our Freelite assays and there's strong interest from the medical community due to the positive impact on diagnosing multiple myeloma patients. In the third quarter, we added CorEvitas, a leading provider of regulatory grade real-world evidence for approved medicines and therapies. CorEvitas is now integrated into our clinical research business, and customers are seeing the benefits of these additional capabilities. The business is off to a great start and performing very well. During the fourth quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Olink, a provider of advanced proteomic solutions that help researchers to gain an understanding of disease at the protein level rapidly and efficiently. As a reminder, Olink Technology compliments our leading mass spectrometry and life science platforms, and we are uniquely positioned to rapidly bring this technology to customers. The transaction is on track to be completed by mid-2024, subject to customary closing additions, including regulatory approvals. In 2023, we also returned $3.5 billion of capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends.  Let me now give you a brief update on our corporate social responsibility initiatives. As a mission-driven company, we help to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also have a positive impact by supporting our communities and being a good steward of our planet. And I'm proud of the actions we took in 2023 in this regard. Building on the environmental sustainability initiatives, we continue to accelerate our transition to renewable energy with on-site solar projects and power purchase agreements around the world. This progress will help us achieve our recently established target of utilizing 80% renewable electricity globally by 2030. To advance Global Health Equity in the fourth quarter, we announced a partnership with Project HOPE to improve the well-being and treatment outcomes for young people living with HIV in Nigeria, the country with the second largest HIV epidemic worldwide. Throughout the year, Thermo Fisher Scientific was once again recognized for our industry leadership and inclusive culture, where colleagues can have a mission-driven career. To list just a few of the recognitions, we were once again included on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies, as well as Fortune's inaugural list of most innovative companies. Newsweek named us as one of America's most responsible companies, Forbes included us on its list of the world's top companies for women, and named us as one of the best employers for veterans. As I reflect on the year, I'm very proud of what our team accomplished. Thanks to our incredible colleagues, we successfully navigated the environment, continued to build a bright future for our company. I'm very excited about 2024 and beyond.  So let me now turn to guidance. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our 2024 revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly cover the highlights. We're initiating a 2024 revenue guidance range of $42.1 billion to $43.3 billion, and an adjusted EPS guidance range of $20.95 to $22 per share. This outlook reflects a continuation of us demonstrating incredibly strong commercial execution and operational discipline and enabling the success of our customers.  I've had the opportunity to connect with many of our customers in January to understand what's on their minds. Based on our longstanding relationships, we have terrific access to the senior executive teams of our customers. From these conversations, it's clear to me that our customers value our partnership and see us as essential to enabling their success. They're enthusiastic for the future because of the progress and pipelines to treat disease, and there's also great enthusiasm with material science customers for the important advances made in those fields. All of this will create strong long-term demand for our capabilities as we enable customer scientific breakthroughs, and we continue to be incredibly well-positioned to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer.  So to summarize our key takeaways for 2023, our proven growth strategy continues to drive significant share gain. We continue to elevate our trusted partner status and deepen the relationship with many customers last year. And this in combination with the power of our PPI business system delivered differentiated performance for the quarter and the full year, helping us to effectively navigate a challenging macroeconomic environment. We're well positioned in 2024 to once again deliver differentiated short-term performance and further strengthen our long-term competitive position. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen. Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release we executed really well in Q4. Market conditions played out largely as we had expected in the quarter, and through the great execution, we delivered 1% more core organic revenue growth than our prior guide. In terms of adjusted EPS, we beat our prior guide by $0.05 and that included offsetting $0.08 of additional FX headwind, so really strong operational execution in the quarter. We also capped off the year with very strong free cash flow delivering $7 billion in 2023. Throughout the year we navigated the changing macro environment very effectively. Our proven growth strategy and PPI business system enabled us to deliver a differentiated experience for our customers and differentiated financial results for our shareholders, all the while continuing to invest in the business and advance our strategic position as the world leader in serving science.  Let me now provide you some additional details in our performance. Beginning with our earnings results, we delivered $5.67 of adjusted EPS in Q4 and $21.55 for the full year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.20 and $15.45 for the full year. On the top line, reported revenue was 5% lower year-over-year in Q4. The components of our Q4 reported revenue change included 7% lower organic revenue, a 1% contribution from acquisitions, and a tail end of 1% from foreign exchange. Q4 core organic revenue decreased 4%. For the full year 2023 reported and organic revenue decreased 5% and core organic revenue growth for the year was 1%. In 2023, we delivered $1.73 billion of pandemic related revenue, $330 million of testing and $1.4 billion of vaccines and therapies revenue.  Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, the organic growth rates by region are skewed by the pandemic-related revenue in the quarter -- in the current year and prior year. In Q4, North America declined low double digits, Europe declined low single digits, Asia Pacific grew low single digits with China declining in the mid-single digits. For the full year, North America declined high single digits, Europe declined low single digits, and Asia-Pacific declined low single digits with China declining high single digits. With respect to our operational performance, we delivered $2.55 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 23.4%, 100 basis points higher than Q4 last year. In the quarter, we continued to deliver exceptionally strong productivity and achieved good price realization, this is partially offset by lower pandemic-related revenue, strategic investments, and FX. The strength of our productivity reflects the impact of our PPI business system. It's enabling us to manage our cost base appropriately given the macro conditions. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 11% and adjusted operating margin was 22.9% in line with our prior guide. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.5%, 10 basis points higher than Q4 last year. The change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those of our adjusted operating margin. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 41.2%.  Moving on to the details of the P&L, adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.1% of revenue, an improvement of 50 basis points over Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 15.2% of revenue, an improvement of 60 basis points compared to 2022. Total R&D expense was $328 million in Q4. For the full year, R&D expense was $1.35 billion, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 6.8% in 2023.  Looking at our results below the line, our Q4 net interest expense was $81 million, which is $38 million lower than Q4 2022. Net interest expense for the full year was $495 million, an increase of $41 million year-over-year. Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense in the quarter of $19 million, $9 million higher than Q4 2022. This is primarily due to changes in non-operating FX. For the full year, adjusted other income and expense was a net expense of $16 million compared to a net income of $14 million in 2022. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter and for the full year was 10%. This was 280 basis points lower than Q4 last year and 300 basis points lower for the full year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. Average diluted shares were 388 million in Q4, approximately 5 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases net of options. And shortly after the year-end in January 2024, we repurchased $3 billion of shares. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, full year cash flow from operations was $8.4 billion and as I mentioned earlier, free cash flow was $7 billion after investing $1.4 billion of net capital expenditures. We returned $136 million of capital to shareholders through dividends in Q4 and $523 million for the full year. During the year, we invested $3.7 billion on completed acquisitions and committed $3.1 billion to the acquisition of Olink, which we expect to close by mid-2024. We ended the quarter with $8.1 billion in cash and $34.9 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.5 times on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 12%, reflecting the strong return on investment that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our pandemic-related revenue varies by segment, and that revenue was higher in the prior year so that does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins. In 2023, we continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address inflation. Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions, Q4 reported revenue in this segment declined 19%, and organic revenue was 20% lower than the prior year quarter. This was driven by the runoff of our pandemic-related revenue in this segment as well as lower levels of activity in our bioproduction business versus the year ago quarter. For the full year, reported and organic revenue was 26% lower than 2022. Q4 adjusted operating income for Life Science Solutions decreased 14% and adjusted operating margin was 36.2%, up 210 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume pull-through. The team has done an excellent job of appropriately managing the cost base and dealing with the unwind of the pandemic. For the full year, adjusted operating income declined 39% and adjusted operating margin was 34.3%. In the Analytical Instruments segments, reported revenue increased 8% in Q4 and organic growth was also 8%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was led by the electron microscopy business. For the full year, both reported and organic revenue were 10% higher than 2022. In this segment, Q4 adjusted operating income increased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 28.8%, up 340 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity and volume pull-through, which is partially offset by FX and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 27% and adjusted operating margin was 26.3%, an increase of 350 basis points versus the prior year. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics, in Q4, reported revenue declined 1% and organic revenue was 7% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q4, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core led by transplant diagnostics, microbiology and immunodiagnostics businesses. This was offset by lower pandemic-related revenue versus the year ago quarter. For the full year, reported revenue declined 8% and organic revenue was down 13%. Q4 adjusted operating income for Specialty Diagnostics increased 27% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 23.9%, which is 530 basis points higher than Q4 of 2022. In Q4, we delivered strong productivity and favorable business mix, which was partially offset by the lower -- the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volume and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income was 10% higher than 2022 and adjusted operating margin was 25.5%, an increase of 400 basis points versus 2022. Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, Q4 reported revenue decreased 4% and organic revenue was 5% lower than the prior year quarter. This was driven by the runoff of vaccines and therapies revenue and the phasing of revenue in our Pharma Services business within 2023 as had been expected. For the full year, both reported and organic revenue were 2% higher than 2022. In this segment, Q4 adjusted operating income declined 4% and adjusted operating margin was 14%, which is 10 basis points lower than Q4 2022. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix. For the full year, adjusted operating income was 17% higher than the prior year and adjusted operating margin was 14.6%, an increase of 180 basis points versus 2022. Let me now turn to guidance, and as Marc outlined, we're initiating a 2024 revenue guidance range of $42.1 billion to $43.3 billion and adjusted EPS guidance range of $20.95 to $22. Our guidance assumes core organic revenue growth in the range of minus 1% to positive 1% for 2024. Our view on the expected market conditions in 2024 has not changed significantly from our initial framing for the year shared on the last earnings call. We're assuming that the market declines in the low single digits this year, our growth strategy and PPI Business System execution will enable us to continue to take share once again this year. Our current estimate of pandemic-related revenue in 2024 is just under $100 million of testing revenue and $300 million to $400 million of vaccines and therapies-related revenue. In total, this represents a year-over-year headwind of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion or 3% of revenue. M&A is expected to increase revenue by $175 million year-over-year, the combination of six months of Olink revenue and the inorganic portion of CorEvitas revenue in 2024. At current rates, we expect FX to be neutral year-over-year to both revenue and adjusted EPS. From a phasing standpoint, FX is expected to be a slight headwind in Q1 and an offsetting tailwind in the second half. Turning to margins, our 2024 guidance range assumes adjusted operating income margins between 22.3% and 22.8%. We continue to aggressively manage our cost base, and that's reflected in this margin outlook. In terms of the range for the margins, that's driven by the revenue range that I provided. We'll continue to use the PPI Business System to not only manage costs very carefully, but also continue to make the right long-term investments to enable us to further advance our industry leadership. Strong underlying productivity and cost controls, including the carryover benefit from the cost actions put in place last year, are expected to largely offset the runoff in the remaining pandemic-related revenue inflation and a normalization of incentive compensation across the company to appropriately invest in our colleagues. Below the line, we expect approximately $430 million of net interest expense in 2024 and expect adjusted other income and expense to net close to zero. We assume that adjusted income tax rate will be 10.5% in 2024 and below the tax line, you should factor in $20 million of profit elimination related to minority interests. We're expecting between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion of net capital expenditures in 2024, and we're assuming free cash flow is in the range of $6.5 billion and $7 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance assumes $3 billion of share buybacks, which, as I mentioned earlier, were already completed in January and we estimate the full year average diluted share count will be approximately 383 million shares. We're assuming that we'll return approximately $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, and we're assuming that we closed the acquisition of Olink by midyear. And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year as there are a few things to consider. First, in terms of organic revenue growth we expect Q1 to be better sequentially than Q4 2023 by 1 to 2 points and then improve each quarter during the year. Implied in that is core organic revenue growth in Q1 similar to Q4 2023. And core organic revenue growth is also expected to improve each quarter during the year, leading to moderate growth in the second half of the year. From a margin standpoint, we expect Q1 to be just under 21% and increase each quarter throughout the year from that level. And we expect Q1 adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 22% of the full year. So in conclusion, we navigated the challenging environment in 2023 very successfully. We stepped up for our customers and delivered differentiated financial performance for our shareholders. We continue to manage the company with agility, and we're really well positioned for the year ahead. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Rafael Tejada : Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Marc, if you look at the business -- so if you look at the business, I think the question is that you start to see some recovery. Could you talk about what parts you think could grow more or less above market and just what that can mean in terms of revenue and earnings? Marc N. Casper: Yes. So Jack, when I think about last year and you've heard us say delivering differentiated short-term performance, strengthen the company for the long term kind of simultaneously, we had the opportunity to look at, obviously, for the first nine months of how others have done, and we looked at those companies that preannounced or reported so far. And we had a really strong year in terms of delivering above-market growth, which means share gain, right. And that share gain actually was broad-based in terms of the performance. You look at things like Analytical Instruments, very strong; clinical research, pharma services. These businesses did well. And by the absence of some, I'm not implying anything in the others. This is a very strong year relative to a challenged set of market conditions. As I think to the future, we're well positioned in those businesses to continue our share gain momentum. We made an assumption for this year, which is pretty much the same as what we said back in late October, is that we're assuming that for the full year, it's going to be pretty similar to 2023 and a mirror image, meaning that we start to lap comps as the year unfolds and we wind up with the market being down slightly in the low single digits and us performing better than that level. So I'm excited about what the year unfolds and our position to deliver differentiated performance. And we're certainly going to capitalize on any improvements in the market and hold ourselves to a very high standard of what good looks like. Jack Meehan : Okay. And are there specific businesses you can talk about, so as an example in the script, I think you talked about transitioning capacity, new therapies. So like in a potential recovery, like what -- can you talk about how you expect phasing for Patheon and some of -- and the bioprocessing business? Marc N. Casper: Yes. So when I think about the year, we basically use a range of outcomes for each of our businesses in terms of how they perform. I believe that the second half of the year based on lapping the comps as well as we're expecting that the market conditions improve slightly as the year unfolds. And that helps with demand for the industry and for us is how I would think about the business in aggregate is the way that we manage the company. So thank you, Jack. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Operator : The next question today comes from the line of Dan Arias from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Daniel Arias : Good morning guys, thanks for the questions. Marc, obviously, a lot of discussion on destocking across the industry. Can you just maybe add some color to where you think you are with that process and maybe draw a distinction for us between the inventory work-down that's taking place on the bioprocess side specifically versus more routine consumables, if you split it that way, are the drawdowns kind of happening at a similar pace and ending in a similar time or do you think we should sort of keep those two buckets separately or think of them differently? Marc N. Casper: Yes. So Dan, I guess, let me start with sort of bioproduction, which I think is the essence of the question, and then maybe I'll step one level above that. In terms of bioproduction, it is an incredibly good long-term market. Historically, it's been an incredibly good market. Sort of a taboo name these days, right, in terms of bioproduction, caused a lot of volatility during certainly 2023 in the industry. For us, a couple of facts, it's a little bit under 10% of our revenue, and we have best-in-class bioprocessing products with an incredible global footprint. We have leading positions in cell culture media, single-use technologies, and increasingly important purification business as we grow our share position there. When I think about the fourth quarter, we did see a sequential pickup in orders in Q4 versus Q3. But the underlying activity is still muted, right, in the market. So we didn't see an inflection. We weren't expecting one and we didn't see one in the fourth quarter. Our view is that it will normalize as the year unfolds and as I've said in an investor conference earlier in the year, no one is going to get rewarded for calling the moment of when that inflection happens. So it will play out during the course of the year, and the long-term fundamentals here are very strong. When I think about our businesses in general coming into the year, I think the things that are very exciting is the trusted partner status that we have earned with our customers over many, many years. We're in the room with the decision-makers. We understand what's on their mind. We're incredibly well positioned. And if I think about the midterm outlook for clinical research, for Pharma Services, for bioproduction, for our channel business, it's incredibly well positioned, right, in terms of we're part of helping our customers bring the breakthroughs to their pipeline, we're part of helping them navigate whatever the environment is. So hopefully, that's helpful. And then maybe the last comment that I would make is one of my takeaways from the many, many customer interactions that I had in the first month of the year was that in the biotech community, and what I mean by biotech, as I'll call it, the smaller companies, the capital market-dependent companies in the pharmaceutical segment, they were much more positive, right. They're seeing green shoots. They love the M&A activity that was happening at the end of the year that gets investors excited about new company formation, new rounds of capital. And while it's early and it will take some time, it's certainly the most optimistic that I've seen in the last five quarters in terms of what the tone was on their view. And I think that bodes very well for the coming few years. Thank you. Daniel Arias : Okay. That's encouraging. Maybe just a follow-up on the AI piece, consistently solid growth there. I'm curious if you're just still carrying a backlog in microscopy. And can you maybe just talk a little bit about lead times and order conversion this year, is the assumption that those might get extended as we move through the year or do you think maybe you can be stable relative to where we are today? Thanks. Marc N. Casper: Yes. So when I think about the performance of our Analytical Instruments business with double-digit growth for the full year, it's awesome. Really a tremendous year. It was across all three businesses. The backlog that we carried into the beginning of 2023, those things largely cleared in the first half of 2023. So we're at -- we've been normal lead times, normal shipping times really for about six months now in terms of that already. So we're kind of in a normal spot. And yeah, there won't be the repeat of the unwind of the pandemic impacts on the supply chain. The business is positioned for a good year and there's a high demand for the breakthrough technologies, whether it's in electron microscopy, or semiconductor, material science, life sciences or the Astral, right, [indiscernible] just incredible demand for those technologies. So we're excited for the upcoming year and the future of that business. Operator : Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Derik De Bruin : Hi, good morning everyone. Marc N. Casper: Good morning Derik. Derik De Bruin : So Marc, I'm just sort of curious, last quarter you were talking about 1% core growth when you were sort of looking at your initial framework for 2024. If I heard you correctly, now it's plus or minus 1%. It didn't seem like Q4 got a lot worse in anything. So what -- sort of what's changed, are you more conservative on the PPD in these businesses, are you more conservative on just tough comps, I'm just sort of curious, what's embedded now in this like more conservative outlook? Marc N. Casper: Stephen, why don't you... Stephen Williamson : Yes. Let me provide some context on the guidance, kind of step back on that and then -- and hopefully help frame your question. So we provided an early framing for 2024 on our last call, and we had the insight on how Q4 played out and have completed our detailed planning work with our businesses. Through that process, our view on the market outlook has not changed significant. The guidance is not significantly different from the initial framing that we provided. It includes the latest view on FX, both rates and expected mix of revenue and cost by currency. That increased revenue from our initial framing, but no impact on operating income, which reduces our margins by 20 basis points from that initial framing. And then from an operational standpoint, I think the only item of note that's changed in the past three months is a discrete item in our Pharma Services business. We're transitioning some of our sterile fill finish capacity from COVID vaccine support to GLP-1 support. Would have been expecting to recognize an upfront fee in Q1 2024. Now the accounting is finalized, we expect to recognize that benefit in line with production, which actually starts in 2025. So it shifted approximately $0.20 out of Q1 2024, and that's had some impact on -- in terms of the reported core growth. And then one other comment on the guidance is that we thought it best to provide a range, not a point estimate. So things are more helpful for our investors and the range of outcomes for the year. Now the range doesn't encapsulate every possible scenario for the year, but it does capture the reasonably likely scenarios of how the year can play out as we see it today. And the range is about $1 billion to a revenue and $1.05 of adjusted EPS, which I think is appropriate given the scale of the company. But hopefully, it kind of tees up kind of the framing for the guide. Derik De Bruin : Okay. And a little bit more, how should we sort of think about the segment margins as we go through, I mean, I'm just sort of looking -- I mean you've seen really good progress in LSS, and it may seem a good progress in your margins, expansion of margins across all of them. But I'm just sort of thinking about how should we think about LPS and given where you were in the -- is that 14% margin range that we're seeing for the full year, is that sort of sustainable, does that fall back next year, I'm just trying to figure out where the margin hit is on given relative to what our expectations were? Stephen Williamson : In terms of the margin profile for the -- we finished the year at exactly where we guided to for the full year for our margin profile for the company. And I think some of the changes in terms of Q4 versus between the segments, I don't think everyone quite understood the phasing of our revenue within lab products and biopharma services. So when I see some of the pre-call notes, this is, I think, a little bit different in terms of what some expectations. But from our expectations internally, Q4 played out as we'd expected. And then from margins going forward, I think the margin profile that we have today, I'm not calling a significant difference in margin profile going forward into next year. And I think where we are on landing point on margins for the segments is probably a good starting point for the -- to think about for the year ahead. Derik De Bruin : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question today comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Douglas Schenkel : Alright, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Marc N. Casper: Good morning Doug, welcome back. Douglas Schenkel : Thanks, great to be back. And working with great focus like you and the team. So I want to start just with a high-level LRP question, and then my follow-up is really just a clarification on LPS. So on the LRP, Marc, you've been consistent in saying that Thermo is built to grow two to three points better than the peer group over the long term. That said, you did talk about 7% to 9% growth as recently as last year's Analyst Day. I'm sure the two to three points hasn't changed. But as we flip the calendar, is it fair to say that the 7% to 9% growth rate maybe is a little bit high, even in a more normalized environment, I just want to give you an opportunity to maybe just adjust that as we kind of flip the calendar and look ahead? And below the top line, you've done a fantastic job, as always, leaning operations in a more challenging period. Never let a good crisis go to waste. Your guidance suggests to me, at least on the surface, that you may be investing more in the near term. But as we think about a return to normal, I'm just wondering if you think we could get some outsized incremental margin flow-through for the business as the business normalizes? So let me leave it there, and then I'll ask a quick follow-up on LPS in a second. Marc N. Casper: Sure. So Doug, thanks for the question. In terms of the long-range outlook, right, we raised our outlook in late in 2021. And what that -- at that moment, we can't remember exactly what that moment was, but we were growing 25%, right. We were growing at an extraordinary organic rate. And what we wanted to do was give our investors a very long-term view of what is the market and what is our position in the market, right. And in terms of our ability to gain share, three points, I think -- two, three, I use three for simplicity. Three points faster than the market is kind of the standard we hold ourselves to. And we've been delivering that for a while, and we've been growing share for a really long while for many, many, many years. And so nothing has changed there. In terms of the market growth, where the market was extraordinary when we set it, we said 4% to 6% was going to be our underlying market growth, and that was higher than 3% to 5%. And the change was actually just that we had a larger exposure to pharma and biotech as we built our business capability there. When I look to the future and I think about what's going on in the drivers of the long term in our industry, I feel incredibly confident that this is a 4% to 6% growth industry and that we're well positioned to grow, for simplicity, three points faster than that, so 7% to 9%. So while I get the question a lot and obviously, in a period where we delivered 1% core growth in 2023, that's a long way from 7% to 9%. But our view on the market declining low single digits last year reflects at least a share gain component. And when I look to the future, I continue to remain very confident in the long-term health of the industry. I've had some really interesting discussions with investors and basically went through the logic saying, if you're bullish on life science tools, diagnostics, pharma services, you're probably at 6% long-term growth. And if you're bearish on the life science tools, diagnostics and pharma services, you're probably at 4% industry growth. But you have to be incredibly bearish on the world to actually get to less than 4% industry growth for the long term in our segment because this -- we really are a GDP-plus-type business in terms of the markets that we serve. So hopefully, that gives you at least a sense of how we think about it and while I appreciate the offer to change our outlook, I couldn't be more confident in the future of our industry and our competitive position. In terms of the below the line, the very high-level concept, I do believe that as you see volumes grow at more normalized rate, you'll see a very strong flow-through on the margins. And part of what's going on with the margins for this year is we reset our incentive compensation for our colleagues back to normalized levels after a year of below that. So just the math as you have some level of headwind embedded in the easier numbers, nothing different than we expected in October. But that's part of why you don't see as much of the margin step-up that one would expect to have. Douglas Schenkel : Okay. I'm going to -- I'll leave the LPS question for another day. But I guess, the other part of my question on the margins, Marc was obviously, you got to pay people, you got to reset things. In a period where you're not growing as much, this is where Thermo has historically played offense while others have played defense to a certain extent. So I'm just wondering if you're actually pulling forward some investment early in the year and that could over the next several quarters lead to even better-than-expected margin flow-through as the company returns to a more normalized period. Stephen Williamson : Yes. Doug, I think the example that I gave on the GLP-1 contract is we're basically standing up a facility for a customer. We're getting paid a fee to do that. We get to recognize that fee over the production volumes, and we're incurring substantial costs in the interim in 2024, which will create good accretive growth going forward. That's one good example. And we're continuing to invest in innovation across the company. And we're not lessening our drive here to really drive great long-term growth. So we're appropriately managing our cost, top line environment, but we're making sure that we're actually putting the right investments in place and to make sure that, that top line environment stays and the outlook stays as good as we -- as much as articulated. Douglas Schenkel : Okay, I will leave it there. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question today comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Vijay Kumar : Hi Marc, good morning and thanks for taking my question. My first one Marc, when I look at the annual guidance here, the core is flattish at the midpoint. But excluding the vaccine headwinds, it's about three points. That's a pretty solid guide. The three things that have come up is China, the CRO business, and analytical tech. Can you just remind us what China and what PPD did in fiscal 2023 and is the guide assuming those three pieces, China, CRO and analytical tech, is that at 3%, about 3%, below 3%? Thank you. Marc N. Casper: So Vijay, thanks for the question. So when I think about the performance of our businesses, certainly last year and certainly as we look to the future, last year, just spectacular performance in our clinical research business. Really, the team, unbelievably good job in terms of the results. I think that in a way, we probably undersold the details, not the numbers as much as what actually was going on because there's so many different things we were communicating. But if I think about clinical research, it's a little over two years after the acquisition, phenomenal acquisition. Customers love the business performing well, colleagues doing a great job. And it's been a big success. The business in the pandemic played the largest role in supporting the clinical trials on vaccines, and at the same time, delivered by far the fastest, I'll call it, underlying growth, excluding all of the COVID activity, just crushed it. And that means for this year, we have both a roll-off, which we've given transparency to on a big chunk of the vaccine revenue, which is fine. And we have generated a really substantial comparison, which is cool. Like we -- that's a good challenge to have in terms of the great performance. So we would expect that the business' growth would be much more moderate this year just based on the comparisons. But the future, meaning looking out into 2025 and beyond, this is a really strong business, long-term, high single-digit growth business plus the synergies it's driving. So I feel really great about that. And then a quick comment just on China and which is unrelated to clinical research but sort of the other element of your question. China, market conditions were challenged in 2023. First quarter was really strong, lots of stimulus, all of those good things. But then -- so that was China effectively. We're not calling for a meaningful improvement in China this year. Rather, we lap the comparisons as the year unfolds. So it becomes a little bit less of a headwind. We all know that at some point, the Chinese government will create some mechanism of stimulus. Whether that's direct or confidence or whatever it does, we don't know when that will happen. But at some point, it will improve the market conditions because the needs for what we do is very high. So I'm bullish on the long term being better in China than what we've been experiencing currently, and it will take some time to get there. Thanks, Vijay. Go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Stephen, just one quick one for you. On Q1, I think operating margin, slightly under 21%. I think the EPS is around $4.70-ish. Is that just the outsized impact from incentive comp reset, just want to understand the Q1 margin cadence? Stephen Williamson : Yes. So when I think about the margin in Q1, that's definitely an element when you look at it year-over-year and kind of sequentially as well. So when I think about it year-over-year -- so there's -- obviously, we have a significant drag from the lower pandemic revenue and the reset of the incentive comp. That's just under 200 basis points in total and then about 100 basis points contribution from the core business despite the lower dollars of revenue. And the key driver there being the impact of the cost actions that we've taken over the past year. So to give you a way to frame the margin in Q1. And then yes, the margin profile grows each quarter as the revenue dollars grow during the year in terms of the profile for the year ahead. Thanks Vijay. Vijay Kumar : It\u2019s helpful. Thank you guys. Rafael Tejada : Operator we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Tejas Savant from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Tejas Savant : Hey guys, good morning. And thanks for the time here. Marc, just a follow-up on your China commentary there, more in terms of the long-term opportunity. You've talked in the past about that being an important market for you growing at the higher end of your outlook for the company. Recently, there's been a thawing in relations over the last month or so. I think you've kind of alluded to that as well and some high-level government engagement. But then a little while ago, we got word of this Biosecure Act legislation. Can you just help us think through sort of what that entails for you, perhaps an opportunity to be more front footed and gain share in the near-term on the services side versus kind of the long-term risk of a potential blowback from the Chinese side in terms of U.S. MNCs operating in that market? That would be super helpful. Thank you. Marc N. Casper: Sure. So thanks for the question. In terms of China, a market that we've been in for 40 years, a set of capabilities that we built over a long period of time that's helped Chinese society, right, and created American jobs as part of it. Better food supply, addressing air pollution, helping produce medicines for the local population, we have a great reputation. I've had the honor of being the Chair of the U.S.-China Business Council over the last couple of years and interacting both with the U.S. administration and the Chinese government. And while it's clear to me that the short-term GDP environment is challenged in China, that the needs for what our industry does and what Thermo Fisher does for the long term is good. It will be a solid growth market, certainly one of the faster-growing geographies in the long-term. In terms of the relations between the countries, yes, I agree with your sentiment, there is a thawing. And in terms of potential legislation, there are thousands of bills that are written that don't happen. So until something sort of matures through the process, it's hard to really know whether it comes to pass and what the exact implications. And my quick read of what they're working on in this particular one, it really is basically an opportunity for non-Chinese companies to have a stronger position in serving Federal Government-related entities. So that's sort of the essence of that. And obviously, as a non-Chinese company, we'd be well positioned to support the U.S. government. So thank you for the question. Let me just do a quick wrap on the call. So thanks everyone for participating in our call today. We entered this year with strong momentum. We're in a great position to deliver an excellent year in 2024. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific, and we look forward to updating you as the year progresses. Thanks, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Angela, and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may begin the call. Rafael Tejada : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading News, Events and Presentations until May 8, 2024. A copy of the press release of our first quarter 2024 earnings is available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials. So before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which is on file with the SEC and available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials SEC filings. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today. Also, during this call, we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our first quarter 2024 earnings and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our first quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we had a great start to the year. We delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. I'm proud of our team's ongoing focus on enabling the success of our customers while demonstrating incredibly strong commercial execution and operational discipline and our continued success as a result of our proven growth strategy and our PPI Business System. So let me first recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter was $10.34 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.28 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margin in Q1 to 22%. And we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving a 2% increase year-over-year to $5.11 per share. Our performance in the first quarter is allowing us to raise our guidance and sets us up to deliver differentiated performance in 2024. Turning to our performance by end market. In the first quarter, underlying market conditions played out as we'd expected. Our team's excellent execution enabled us to deliver differentiated revenue performance that was ahead of our expectations.  Now let me provide you some additional context. Starting with pharma and biotech. We declined in the low single digits for the quarter, which was a sequential improvement in performance over Q4 2023. In the first quarter, the vaccine and therapy revenue runoff resulted in a 3-point headwind for this customer segment. And we also delivered strong growth in our clinical research business. A quick reminder on academic and government and industrial and applied. A year ago, we had very strong shipments of analytical instruments as we worked down the backlog that was caused by pandemic-related supply chain disruptions. As a result in academic and government, we declined in the low single digits during the quarter. We delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy business as well as in our research and safety market channel. In Industrial and Applied, we declined in the low single digits for the quarter. We delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy business in this segment.  Finally, in Diagnostics and Healthcare in Q1, we declined in the high single digits. The reported growth in this end market was impacted by the runoff of COVID-19 testing-related revenue. During the quarter, core revenue growth was highlighted by our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses as well as our health care market channel. So wrapping up on our end markets. Underlying market conditions played out as we expected to start the year. As you recall, our assumption for 2024 is that we'll see a modest pickup in economic activity as the year progresses. During the quarter, it was good to see a couple of positive developments in our end markets that support this view, including continued improvements in the biotech funding environment and the stimulus program announced by China. I'll now turn to an update on our growth strategy. As a reminder, our strategy consists of 3 pillars : high-impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar, high-impact innovation. We had an excellent start to the year, launching a number of new products across our businesses during the first quarter. Let me first highlight a number of products in analytical instruments that demonstrate our continued market leadership. In our chromatography and mass spectrometry business, we launched the Thermo Scientific Dionex Inuvion Ion Chromatography system, which enables higher resolution, faster time to results and streamlined workflows to more efficiently identify contaminants for environmental testing. In our Chemical Analysis business, we launched the Thermo Scientific LInspector Edge In-line Metrology solution to enhance battery safety, performance and production. And we also launched the Thermo Scientific TruScan G3 Handheld Raman Analyzer, a next-generation handheld instrument for the rapid identification of chemical compounds used in drug production. And then in Life Science Solutions, we launched the Axiom PangenomiX Array, a high-throughput microarray for use in human genomic studies across global populations, including disease risk and detection research as well as population scale disease research programs. So another strong quarter of product launches. One other highlight of our high-impact innovation during the quarter was being named as one of Fast Company Magazine's Most Innovative Companies. It's great external recognition for the impact that our team is driving for our customers. Moving to the second pillar of our strategy. We are in the trusted partner status over many years, and it gives me the unique opportunity to connect with our customers' senior executive teams. Since the beginning of the year, I've had many meetings with our customers as they're turning to us more than ever. This is to both reinforce our partnership as well as to help them navigate the opportunities and challenges that they face. These conversations are happening across our company at all levels of the organization. Our customers see our team as part of theirs. And our culture of always finding a better way every day serves to reinforce our trusted partner status with our customers. We do not take lightly the trust our customers have in our company. And we'll continue to partner closely with them to enable their innovation and productivity. The first example of this is in our clinical next-generation sequencing business. In the quarter, we announced a collaboration with Bayer to develop a next-generation sequencing-based companion diagnostic that will help identify patients who may benefit from Bayer's growing portfolio of precision cancer therapies. The second example is our Analytical Instrument business. We are partnering with the North Carolina Collaboratory to support PFAS research capacity in state as they help to identify and implement solutions to address PFAS contamination. This is the first network of its kind. And they'll use several of our state-of-the-art instruments, including the Orbitrap Astral in their research. And finally, in our Clinical Research business, I'll share 2 examples of how our trusted partner status comes to life as our customers look for solutions to their unmet needs. We expanded our portfolio of GMP lab services to include qPCR-based biosafety testing capabilities for the detection of bacteria and other contaminants in medicines. This offering enables significantly faster results versus traditional testing method, allowing for quicker delivery of medicines to patients. And we launched the CorEvitas Syndicated Clinical Registry in generalized pustular psoriasis to address an unmet need for real-world evidence related to outcomes for patients with this rare disease. As you recall, CorEvitas became part of our company last year. The business is performing very well and making a difference for our customers and patients. All of these are great examples of our trusted partner status. Now let me turn to our PPI Business System, which enables outstanding execution during the quarter. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day. You can see it in our strong profitability and cash flow that we delivered in the first quarter. Looking forward, our team is actively utilizing generative AI as part of the PPI Business System to increase efficiency and productivity as well as to continue to improve the customer experience across the company. To share a couple of examples of how we're applying AI, it's enabling us to accelerate software development timelines in our Analytical Instruments and Life Science Solutions businesses. We're also leveraging the combination of large language models with a vast and differentiated amount of data at our disposal. One benefit we're seeing is our ability to enhance the capability of our technical and customer service teams to more effectively serve our customers. Generative AI is another great example of how we continually strengthen the impact of the PPI Business System. Let me now give you an update on our corporate social responsibility initiatives. As a mission-driven company, we help to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also have a positive impact by supporting our communities, being a good steward of our planet and the focusing on [indiscernible] education and advancing global health equity. To that end, during the first quarter, we announced a collaboration with the South African Medical Research Council. Together, we'll establish a center of excellence and training program focused on molecular biology and life sciences. The facility will provide specialized education and support for professional development to scientists and laboratory professionals in Africa. I'm also pleased to share that Thermo Fisher achieved a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index for the eighth year in a row. Let me now give you an update on capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we reached the 1-year anniversary of The Binding Site acquisition, now our protein diagnostics business. Its financial performance is tracking ahead of the deal model with really strong growth. I recently had the chance to visit the headquarters of our protein diagnostics business and saw great progress they're making, given the exciting new products that can positively impact patient care for multiple myeloma. Turning to our planned acquisition of Olink. We're working through the regulatory process, and the transaction is on track to close by mid-2024. We look forward to welcoming new colleagues to the company later this year. And in terms of return of capital during the quarter, we repurchased $3 billion of shares and increased our dividend by 11%. As I reflect on the quarter, I'm very proud of what our team accomplished and grateful for their contributions to our success. In a nice recognition of both our team and track record, Thermo Fisher has once again been included on Fortune Magazine's List of Most Admired Companies. Let me now turn to our guidance. Given the stronger operational performance at the start of the year, we are raising our 2024 guidance. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $42.3 billion to $43.3 billion, and we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $21.14 to $22.02 per share. Stephen will take you through the details in his remarks. So to summarize our key takeaways from the first quarter. We delivered another quarter of strong financial results driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI Business System. We continue to enable our customer success, and this continually reinforces our trusted partner status. Our strong results in Q1 position us to deliver differentiated performance in 2024 as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our first quarter results for the total company then provide color on our 4 business segments, and I'll conclude by providing our updated 2024 guidance. Before I get into the details of our financial performance, let me provide you with a high-level view on how the first quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. In Q1, market conditions were as we expected. We had another quarter of excellent execution, and this enabled us to deliver Q1 financials meaningfully ahead of what we had assumed in our prior guidance. Core organic revenue was $150 million or 1.5% ahead, and adjusted EPS was $0.40 ahead. To give you some color on that $0.40, $0.19 was from very strong profitability pull-through on the revenue beat, $0.12 was from phasing of spending within the year, $0.07 was from lower FX headwinds and $0.02 was from lower net interest expense. So we're continuing to manage the business really well and are off to a great start to the year. Let me now provide you with some additional details on our performance, beginning with earnings per share. In the quarter, we grew adjusted EPS by 2% to $5.11. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $3.46, up 4% from Q1 last year. On the top line, in Q1, reported revenue was 3% lower year-over-year. The components of our Q1 reported revenue change included 4% lower organic revenue and a slight contribution from acquisitions. Q1 core organic revenue decreased 3%. And in the quarter, pandemic-related revenue was approximately $200 million, including $175 million of vaccines and therapies-related revenue. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. In Q1, North America declined mid-single digits, Europe declined low single digits, and Asia Pacific and China declined in the low single digits. With respect to our operational performance. The team used the PPI Business System to execute really well in the quarter, delivering $2.3 billion of adjusted operating income, which is 22% of revenue, 20 basis points higher than Q1 last year. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.8%, 150 basis points higher than Q1 last year. In the quarter, we continued to deliver very strong productivity, reflecting our continued focus on cost management as well as the carryover benefits from the cost actions put in place last year. This enabled us to more than offset the impact of lower volumes while appropriately funding investments to further advance our industry leadership. Moving to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.5% of revenue. Total R&D expense was $330 million in Q1, reflecting our ongoing investment in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of manufacturing revenue was 7.2% in the quarter. Looking at results below the line, our Q1 net interest expense was $84 million, which is $70 million lower than Q1 2023 due to increased cash balances. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10.5%. And average diluted shares were 384 million in Q1, approximately 4 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases, net of option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We had a strong start to the year with cash flow generation. Q1 cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion, and free cash flow for Q1 was $910 million after investing $340 million of net capital expenditures. We continue to return capital to shareholders in Q1 with an 11% increase in our dividend and the $3 billion of share buybacks, which were completed in January. We ended the quarter with $7.25 billion in cash and short-term investments and $35.6 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter were 3.3x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.6x on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments in our total company performance. Adjusted ROIC was 11.8%, reflecting the strong return on investment that we've been generating across the company. Now I'll provide some color on the performance of our 4 business segments, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q1 reported revenue in this segment declined 13%, and organic revenue was 12% lower than the prior year quarter. This is driven by moderation in pandemic-related revenue in the segment as well as lower levels of activity in our bioproduction business versus the year-ago quarter. Q1 adjusted operating income for Life Sciences Solutions increased 1%. And adjusted operating margin was 36.8%, up 480 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During Q1, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume pull-through. The team continues to do an excellent job to appropriately manage the cost base and deal with the unwind of the pandemic. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue declined 2%, and organic growth was 1% lower than the prior year quarter. We continue to deliver very strong growth in the electron microscopy business. And as a reminder, we have very strong comparisons in the segment in the quarter due to high level of instrument shipments in Q1 last year as we work down the backlog. In the segment, Q1 adjusted operating income decreased 5%, and adjusted operating margin was 23.7%, 70 basis points lower year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments. Turning to our Specialty Diagnostics. In Q1, reported revenue and organic revenue were flat versus the prior year quarter. In Q1, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core led by our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses as well as in our health care market channel. Q1 adjusted operating income for Specialty Diagnostics increased 5%. And adjusted operating margin was 26.5%, which is 120 basis points higher than Q1 2023. During the quarter, we delivered favorable business mix and good productivity, which was partially offset by strategic investments. And finally, in Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, both reported revenue and organic growth decreased 1% in Q1 versus the prior year quarter. This was driven by the runoff of vaccines and therapies revenue. During the quarter, we delivered strong growth in our clinical research business. Q1 adjusted operating income declined 6%. And adjusted operating margin was 13%, which is 80 basis points lower than Q1 2023. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments. Turning now to guidance. As Marc outlined, given the strong start to the year, we're raising our 2024 full year guidance. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $42.3 billion to $43.3 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $21.14 to $22.02. At the midpoint, that reflects a core revenue increase of just under $100 million. We continue to assume core organic revenue growth will be in a range of minus 1% to positive 1% for 2024. We continue to assume that the market declines low single digits this year. Our growth strategy in PPI Business System execution will enable us to continue to take share once again. In terms of adjusted EPS. The increase in the guidance at the midpoint is just over $0.10. The majority of this is from the core revenue raise and also $0.02 from assumed lower net interest expense versus our prior guidance. Our 2024 updated guidance range assumes an adjusted operating income margin between 22.4% and 22.8%, slightly improved from the prior guide. We continue to use the PPI Business System to enable excellent execution, manage costs appropriately and fund the right long-term investments to enable us to further advance our industry leadership. So a great start to the year and increase in the guidance outlook. We remain well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance. I thought it would be helpful to remind you of some of the key underlying assumptions behind the guide that remain unchanged from the previous guidance. In 2024, we're assuming just under $100 million of testing revenue and $300 million to $400 million of vaccines and therapies-related revenue. In total, this represents a year-over-year headwind of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion or 3% of revenue. We see that FX will be roughly neutral year-over-year to both revenue and adjusted EPS. Given recent FX rate changes, we're assuming that the $0.07 beat that we saw in Q1 is offset in the remainder of the year, leading to no change for the year as a whole for FX versus our prior guide. We expect the adjusted income tax rate will be 10.5% in 2024. And we're assuming between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion of net capital expenditures and free cash flow in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion. In terms of capital deployment. We're assuming $3 billion of share buybacks, which were completed in January. We expect to return approximately $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, we continue to see [ we will close ] the Olink acquisition by midyear. Full year average diluted share count is assumed to be approximately 383 million shares. And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing. In Q2, we expect revenue dollars to step up from the first quarter, and organic growth will likely be 2 points better than Q1. And we expect Q2 adjusted EPS to be similar to Q1. This reflects the revised view of the phasing of spending within the year that I mentioned. I think this view of Q2 is pretty close to what's currently baked into consensus right now. So to conclude. We delivered on our commitments in Q1, and we're in a great position to deliver differentiated performance for all our stakeholders in 2024. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Rafael Tejada : Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have the first question from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Douglas Schenkel : Simply put, it was a better start than expected to the year. Marc, can you share color on : one, how did the quarter progress; and two, how does that progression. And really momentum heading into the second quarter, how do those things inform your thinking on the outlook for the balance of the year? Marc Casper : Doug, thanks. So I thought just in the spirit of continuous improvement in PPI that I would frame a few of the key points for the Q&A session and then get to your questions. So indulge me for a second. So when I think about the key points. One, I will start with the long term. We serve an awesome industry that has a bright future, right? And when you think about what drives the bright future, very durable growth driven by the great science, the strong pipelines and the unmet medical needs. When I think about the first quarter, zooming into the short term, market conditions were in line with our expectations and really with strong execution in the quarter that resulted in the financial performance that was ahead of our expectations, it allowed us to retire risk as well as raise our full year outlook. Reminding our investors what's assumed in the '24 guidance is that we're going to see a modest step-up or pickup in economic activity as the year progresses. And during the quarter, it was really good to see a couple of positive developments in our end markets that supports the view of a pickup as the year progresses, which is continued improvements in the biotech funding environment and the stimulus program that was announced by China. As you know, how we define success is that we deliver differentiated short-term performance with a strong emphasis on share gain while strengthening our competitive position for the long term. And Q1 was another quarter in which we achieved that. So Doug, as I think about the phasing of the quarter, market really played out exactly as we thought it was. And we looked at the different parts of it and really in aggregate and the pieces that really played out that way. As the quarter unfolded, what I would say is didn't see a huge change in pattern, although March was a little bit better than the first couple of months. You had the way Easter laid out, which kind of makes it a little bit hard to know exactly, but it felt like March was a good exit rate, consistent with a modest step-up, and that's baked into it. And I would say that April is, in the first couple of weeks kind of playing out with that as well. Douglas Schenkel : Okay. That's super helpful. And thank you for the high-level thoughts as well. If I could maybe just kind of double-click into an area of focus for all of us. Lab products and services was stronger than expected, relative to certainly what I had in my model and from what I can tell is in consensus. In particular, obviously, the CRO and CDMO businesses are a focus for all of us. What are you seeing there? Is it fair to say that things are picking up there a little bit better and maybe better than expected? Keeping in mind that some of the early updates from CMO peers have been relatively encouraging. And then I think maybe more on the CRO side is where we'd see this impact. But as we kind of keep in mind that Q1 was the best biopharma funding quarter in about 5 years, how does that make you feel about the outlook for the next several quarters and the years ahead? Stephen Williamson : Doug, I'll tee up kind of the view versus the consensus first, and I'm not going to talk about the kind of business dynamics. So we don't guide by segment in terms of our organic growth. And for us, it came in -- as Marc said, the markets came in as we had expected in aggregate. And that's the same thing for the segment, and we executed well. So it wasn't a huge outperformance part of the beat that was kind of pretty much across the board for the company. Marc Casper : Yes. And then when you get into the dynamics, the one thing I would call out is in our CRO capabilities, clinical research, the former PPD business, really excellent execution in the first quarter, drove really very strong performance, very proud of what the team accomplished. And when I think about the market dynamics, definitely seeing the pipeline of activity picking up. And as you certainly know, it takes a while for that to actually materialize into revenues, given the cycle of the business, but very encouraging given the biotech funding environment to see that level of pipeline of work picking up. So thank you, Doug. Operator : The next question is from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : Great. Congrats on the quarter. Marc, I want to pick up on something you just mentioned. You called out continued improvement in biotech funding environment. And earlier, you talked about the stimulus in China, 2 positive developments on the end market in 1Q. But I think you also acknowledged it's still relatively early going for those. And there have been a few false starts in end markets, of course, of 2023. So I guess the question is, what gives you confidence that these have really turned the corner? What data points you're looking for as the year progresses and especially given your position on the China Business Council. Just when do you think the better funding stimulus will show up as revenues for you for Thermo? Marc Casper : Yes. So Mike, I think it's a great question, I liked the way you framed it as well. So we're not -- nothing about false starts. The way that I think about it is and super clear on the word choice. What was assumed in our original guidance was a modest pickup. The 2 data points that I called out would be consistent with that view. So we're not changing our view upwards on the market, but rather what's going to drive the slight pickup, the fact that biotech funding is improving and that China announced a stimulus program. I think everybody was probably positively surprised that they announced it as early in the year as that they did, and they're trying to get their economy growing. Those are good facts to support the modest step-up and set ourselves up for an even stronger set of market conditions as we enter 2025. So that's how I think about the kind of the phasing of what's going on in the market. And then the other thing that I would just note about the quarter which was very positive is that it actually played out as we expected, right, including the 4 end markets. And that's good because, I mean, the normal incredible visibility and predictability that you typically have in this business is returning, which is helpful as well. Michael Ryskin : Okay. That's really helpful. And Doug asked about lab products and services. Let me focus on Analytical Instruments. You called out electron microscopy continue to do very well there. But -- and you do have really tough comps. But maybe you could focus a little bit on chromatography mass spec. What are you seeing there from an end market perspective? There's been a lot of concern about pharma CapEx budgets and sort of how they're trending in 2024. So any early comments you can say about that part of the portfolio? Marc Casper : Yes. So Mike, when I think about Analytical Instruments, we had a really good quarter. And it's against a very, very strong comparison, which is why I called it out because compared to the high teens growth last year, it's important to flag it. Let me start with electron microscopy then I'll get to chrome mass spec. So electron microscopy, the business has been performing at a great level, continues to have a strong order book and just doing a really good job. And I feel great about that. When I think about chromatography, mass spectrometry, they as well have incredibly strong comparisons. We're getting really good uptake on the Astral and really have had some milestone level of shipments on that product over the first 9 months of owning and [ relaunching ] it. So that's gone well. Most of our business is in the high-end research portion, which has done well for us. We have a little bit less exposure to kind of the more routine applications. I did flag one product that we launched, which is really quite relevant. As you know, we're the very strong market leader in ion chromatography. You hear a lot about PFAS testing, things of this sort. And we launched the next generation of instrumentation there, which it's great, just given how large our fleet is around the world, and that product is off to a great start. So I feel good about the outlook, the different pieces. And I highlighted a couple of interesting launches in chemical analysis, the smallest of the 3 businesses where we're enabling battery production and really trying to change the way that QA/QC is done in pharmaceutical manufacturing by having raw materials inspected at the factory versus doing lab testing and the Handheld Raman Analyzer does that. So really great innovation drives growth in the business and a really good performance to start the year. Operator : The next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack Meehan : Wanted to keep digging in on the pharma businesses here. So the first question is on clinical research. You called out strong growth. Just a clarification. Is this inclusive of the COVID headwinds you've talked about before? The tone sounds more positive. Any comments around what you're seeing would be great. Marc Casper : Yes. There's no adjustments on any of that. It's just business just grew through that. And when I think about the year, when I think about the guidance that some busy assumptions are better than the guidance. We reminded our investors that we had the largest role in clinical research on supporting the pandemic response. We also had, in parallel, incredible growth in the business, and really just an excellent start and excellent execution to deliver strong growth in the quarter. And while we expect this business will moderate this year relative to the last few years, just the momentum it has bodes extremely well for the midterm of high single-digit growth business plus synergies. So the team has done a great job of becoming part of the company, leveraging our relationships and getting really strong commercial momentum. So really nice start to the year. Jack Meehan : Awesome. And then on the pharma services side, there's been a little bit of a competitive shake up with Novo's proposed acquisition of Catalent. Can you just talk about your win rates at Patheon and how you feel about the runway for future tech transfers? Marc Casper : Yes. So Jack, when I think about pharma services, the business has performed very well. And when I think about the industry dynamics that have gone on, in an area that we're the market leader, [ start until finish ] where we put the medicine or vaccine in its final dosage form. Effectively, you have one of the pure-play competitors being taken out of the CDMO business effectively or less so. And that in an area where capacity is constrained already, it bodes really well for our business. As the market leader and great reputation, our activity level is high. The number of dialogue we're having with our customers is high. We're securing new business. So I feel great about it. And our job as the trusted partner is to enable our customer success, right? And our customers think in decades in this industry. And when there's events that uncertain, whether it's Biosecure or whether it's an acquisition of one of the suppliers, they look at the industry leader and say, \"This is a company that doesn't create uncertainty, does a great job.\" Those things ultimately allow us to better support our customers going forward. Operator : The next question is from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Rachel Vatnsdal Olson : Perfect. Congratulations on the quarter. So I wanted to dig into the comments around China stimulus a little bit more. Just on one hand, the language around the stimulus is fairly broad, but this tranche also appears to be 2.5x the dollar amount of the stimulus package that benefited last year. So can you walk us through what are you hearing from customers regarding the stimulus? Are you working on proposals with customers yet? Or have you even seen any orders related to that stimulus come through, albeit it's probably that early for that. And then just to follow up on those comments around the timeline for stimulus. If you look at what happened last year, the stimulus was actually announced in September '22, but we really didn't see an impact until early 2023. So given that delay between initial announcement and actually seeing the benefit, in your view, could we potentially see the benefit this year? Or could this ultimately be a 2025 dynamic? Marc Casper : So Rachel, thanks for the question. I share the enthusiasm about the government's efforts to stimulate the economy, get things going. So it's an interesting time in that respect. So... Stephen Williamson : And just back to Mike's comment about what the view on is this start, these starts, false start, I think it's a good thing that China is trying to find ways to stimulate the economy. And I think this is one element of it, and we look forward to other things happening as well as just the way the China is managing the economy. As Marc said, go ahead. Marc Casper : Yes, yes. So when I think about actually the way things play out, and a lot of this is about signaling as far as I can tell from my own experience of work in China for many years. It's a multiyear program as opposed to the last one, which was shorter term. So basically, the government is signaling, at least, to the economy that they're looking for investments in instrumentation equipment, technological advances, advanced research. So that's very encouraging in terms of that it's not a short-term program, but rather longer term. And yes, we've already have proposals in front of customers. And yes, there's quite a bit of dialogue. Customers are actually waiting for some of the very practical details of how this will work because it varies by province, ultimately. So to my knowledge, no orders yet. I wouldn't expect any of that quickly anyway but lots of activity. And the way that I would think about this is there's the direct effect and then the indirect effect. I would expect that we would see orders really later in the year and some revenue late in the year directly associated with the stimulus, but that may miss by a few months, one way or the other. So I wouldn't expect material shipments in Q2 around this. So it would be the way I would think about my experience. The indirect effect is a confidence booster, right, which is basically saying the government is going to try to get the economy up and going. And that should help more broadly, and that doesn't help tomorrow, but it helps from a contextual standpoint of business confidence. So I think those things would say that you're seeing China try to get the economy growing. We're not assuming a lot in China in our numbers this year as part of major changes. So what I'm most excited about there is that it sets up for '25. Not that we won't see a benefit this year, but it's kind of a direction of travel. And our view is more of a return tranche should be a good market for us. Rachel Vatnsdal Olson : Perfect. Really appreciate all that detail. I just wanted to stick on China for my follow-up then. Obviously, we've seen some of these headlines around Biosecure Act. We've heard some of your customers talking about trying to derisk some of their supply chains and go with more Western manufacturers, just given where we're at from that headline perspective. So I wanted to see how has that been impacting your customer conversations? Have you seen any increase in inbounds in terms of Patheon? And then just from a timing, if you were to benefit from this. Obviously, a pretty capacity-constrained sector right now. I know you mentioned some of the Catalent-Novo dynamics earlier as well. Could you even benefit in the near term from any competitive wins related to Biosecure? Or is it just a function of capacity constrained, this really alludes to the value chain and the vertical integration that Thermo has but will be more of a benefit longer term? Marc Casper : So the way that I think about Biosecure is I kind of put it into the context of there's a level of geopolitical tensions that exist around the world, including between the U.S. and China. It's never exactly clear whether these things become enacted or not. It's our job to help our customers navigate those shifting landscapes. I think at the highest level, actually relations are falling between the countries a bit. There will always be challenges. When I think about how this could play out, should it play out, I think that what is making the customer base that's largely Western in terms of where biotech and pharmaceutical activity is largely, I think more of supply chains, who's doing development work, et cetera. Given our network is effectively 100% in U.S. and Western Europe and that set of capabilities, we're likely to be a long-term beneficiary, not per se of the Act, but rather the fact that customers are thinking about who are their partners and where should those partners be based. So I think that's a long term, should be okay, and I don't think it has any material impact to the results in the short term. Thank you, Rachel. Operator : The next question is from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Daniel Brennan : Marc and Stephen, maybe just on China. I know some -- there's already been some discussion points here, Marc. But could you just give us a sense how the low single-digit decline in the quarter kind of compared to expectations? And just remind us what to assume for the full year? And kind of any color you can share about just demand trends across your business segments in China. Marc Casper : So when I think about China, that actually played out as we expected. The team delivered on the expectations for the quarter. And as you know, our guidance, we don't guide by geography or by business. It's really the aggregate overall. But actually, the first quarter played out as the team expected and executed well. When you kind of go down to the subsegments of China, now you're going to the tiny portion of our revenue. Nothing really significant of note in terms of things better or worse than what we've been seeing or what we would expect. So that's will be a high-level deal. Looking forward to returning to China early in the summer. So get some firsthand perspectives on that as well. Daniel Brennan : Got it. And then maybe just on bioprocessing. I know the consumable portion of your business, Marc is, call it, 10% of our revenues, but there's obviously a tremendous focus there right now. Could you give any color on how that business performed in the quarter? And any color you can provide on like this ongoing destock issue. Whether or not you've seen orders start to grow again sequentially. Marc Casper : Yes, Dan, thanks for the question on bioproduction. It's definitely a factor. Where it got in the queue of the question, it says that the emphasis is reducing on that so as becoming a little bit more predictable. Really, Q1 was in line with expectations. Organic growth did decline as we expected in the quarter due to the strong comparisons from a year ago. But when I look at orders, that's now 2 quarters in a row with really good sequential bookings growth, nice improvement in book-to-bill. And when I look at the things that have been said externally about the quarter, I feel really good about our performance in terms of how we execute it. So working out, in line with what we thought would happen. Thanks, Dan. Operator : The next question is from Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Sykes : Maybe just revisiting the AI segment and maybe just compare, contrast the end markets and where you're seeing some of the greatest strength. It sounds like industrial applied remains strong, but just would love to hear you kind of go through biopharma, applied industrial and academic, government and sort of the phasing of growth over the course of this year in those end markets for AI. Marc Casper : Sure. So when I think about the business, one of the things, Matt, is we really don't manage it by end segment because effectively, you produce a certain amount of products, and then you ship them to specific customers. So you can have quarters where you ship more to an industrial customer, the exact same product as a biopharma customer. And therefore, it kind of skews things. So that's my caveat of that. When I look at the parts of the business, the industrial and applied continues to have strong momentum in semiconductor material science applications for electron microscopy was strong. So in terms of how that played out, very difficult comparisons for all of the businesses based on the shipments a year ago, but that was strong. And then the other segments in terms of academic, government, pharma, biotech, pretty much played out as we expected. So nothing that really jumped out at me as being significant in terms of trends or patterns. Matthew Sykes : Got it. And then just for my follow-up. Just on LPS and the margins, I know when you had acquired PPD, you talked about potential for long-term margin expansion in that business. Could you just maybe talk about some of the levers you've got within LPS. Understanding that revenue improvement would help a lot, but just any levers to get that margin within LPS to expand that over time. Marc Casper : I'll start, and then maybe Stephen will add a few additional thoughts. So when I think about margins and obviously, you have different businesses there. The clinical research business, formerly PPD, incredibly strong operational execution, right? So when you actually look at utilization rates, modification, all of the things that ultimately drive margins, they're doing a great job and executing really well. We're, obviously, benefiting from the synergies that we outlined, and we will have achieved all of our synergy targets on the cost side. So that's gone well. And so they're really doing a great job of executing the trials really well, and that bodes well for margin expansion along with volume. When I think about pharma services, there, the underlying is very strong. But we obviously have capacity coming online and also the runoff of the COVID revenues. So when you lose the volume, you see short-term pressure on margins. But if I say, how is the team operating? Actually, the team is operating well. So the margins there will expand as the year progresses and into the future as well. So that will be my thoughts about margins. I don't know, Stephen, anything? Stephen Williamson : I think on the pharma services side, it's the capacity coming online and switching over. There's cost to do that as you're ramping up the facility, bringing on the colleagues to be able to operate that facility. Those are all factors that come into that, but those are the right drivers. Thanks, Matt. Operator : The last question we have time for today is from Luke Sergott with Barclays. Luke Sergott : So I want to dig back in into the Biosecure Act, a follow-up on what Rachel was asking about. But I wanted to know, Marc, what you guys are hearing from your customers and multinationals that operate over there and what they're saying to you regarding their assumptions on China retaliating and maybe excluding them from the region. I know it seems pretty unlikely, and it's probably going to be limited, but is this something that is on their radar or some of those conversations that you're having? Marc Casper : Yes. I can't really speculate. It wouldn't be prudent on how -- whether this thing will even come to pass. And if it comes to pass, what is the response to it. Our job is to do a great job of supporting our customers globally to comply with the global regulations, both the actual regulations and the spirit of the regulations of the various countries, and we'll do a good job navigating it. So that's how I would think about it, Luke. Luke Sergott : Yes. Okay. And then, Stephen, for you on the life science margins. So very, very strong here from Life Science Solutions. I understand that the destocking is less of an issue, but how much of the step-up in the quarter was from the restocking? Just kind of walk through it and double-click on the drivers there. And should we consider this as kind of the jump-off point? Or it will be around this range for the rest of the year? Anything from a modeling perspective? Stephen Williamson : So Luke, the really good margin profile in the segment. And it's really about addressing the cost base in that business given the lower volumes, both from the pandemic unwind and the kind of the bioproduction aspect to it. So it's really just fundamentally investing the costs that we have in that business. Team's done a great job of doing that, and that's the way to think about that. Marc Casper : So thank you, Luke, and thanks, everyone, for the questions. So let me wrap up. Very pleased to deliver a very strong quarter. Incredibly well positioned to deliver differentiated performance as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders, build an even brighter future for our company. I look forward to updating you on our second quarter results in July and discussing our very bright future as well as outlook at our upcoming Investor Day on September 19. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Thermo Fisher Scientific 2024 Second Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may begin the call. Rafael Tejada : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investor section of our website thermofisher.com, under the heading News, Events, and Presentations until August 7, 2024. A copy of the press release of our second quarter 2024 earnings is available in the investor section of our website under the heading financials.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our second quarter 2024 earnings and also in the investor section of our website under the heading financials. So with that I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Raf, thank you. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we had great results for the quarter. We're making excellent progress to deliver differentiated results for the year. I'm proud of our team as they executed at a very high level to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer. This continued success is a result of our proven growth strategy and our PPI business system. So first, let me recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter was $10.54 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.35 billion. Adjusted operating margin increased in Q2 to 22.3%. And we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving a 4% increase year-over-year to $5.37 per share. Our performance in the second quarter is allowing us to raise our guidance once again and continue our track record of delivering differentiated results. Turning to our performance by end market, in the second quarter, underlying mark conditions played out as we'd expected. Our team's excellent execution drove share gain in the quarter, and we delivered a sequential improvement in growth in all four of our end markets. Let me provide you with some additional context. Starting with pharma and biotech, we declined in the low-single-digits for the quarter. The vaccine and therapy revenue runoff resulted in a 4 point headwind for this customer segment. Performance in the second quarter was led by our biosciences and clinical research businesses. In academic and government and in industrial and applied, we grew in the low-single-digits during the quarter. In both these end markets, we delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy business. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, we declined in the low-single-digits. As a reminder, the reported growth in this end market is impacted by the runoff of COVID-19 testing-related revenue. During the quarter, the team delivered good core revenue growth highlighted by our transplant diagnostic and immunodiagnostics businesses, as well as our healthcare market channel. As I reflect on our performance during the quarter and on a year-to-day basis, I feel very good about the progress we've made at the halfway point of the year. Our end markets are playing out as we expected, and our team's execution has been excellent. I'll now turn to an update on our growth strategy. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars. High impact innovation; our trusted partner status with customers; and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar, it was a fantastic quarter of innovation as we launched a number of high impact new products across our businesses. I'll begin with the new technologies we launched at the American Society for Mass Spectrometry Conference, further strengthening our industry leading position in analytical instruments. At the conference, we introduced the Thermo Scientific Stellar Mass Spectrometer, which extends our leadership in proteomics. The Thermo Scientific Stellar is used to validate biomarker candidates. It offers unprecedented analytical capabilities for targeted quantitation, enabling the insights needed by researchers to advance their work. It's a perfect complement to our groundbreaking Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral, used for protein discovery that we launched last year. It was incredibly exciting to hear the customer testimonials sharing the power of the Orbitrap Astral. To-date, we've had more than 40 publications that incorporated the impact of this breakthrough, and we're really just getting started. Also at ASMS, we launched three new build-for-purpose editions of the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid Mass Spectrometer tailored to specific applications for MultiOmics, Structural Biology and BioPharma. These instruments continue to elevate our industry-leading Thermo Scientific Orbitrap portfolio by offering enhanced speed and sensitivity to detect and characterize the most difficult protein samples, including complex biologics. This quarter we also launched products to help our customers meet their own sustainability goals. In our bioproduction business, we introduced a first of its kind bio-based film for our single-use technologies. These new bioprocess containers use plant-based material rather than fossil fuel materials to provide lower carbon solutions for the manufacturer of biologics. And in our laboratory products business, we launched a new line of Energy Star certified Thermo Scientific TSX universal series ULT freezers that deliver industry-leading performance and energy efficiency to help labs meet their sustainability goals. Turning to the highlights of our second and third pillars of our growth strategy, during the quarter we continue to strengthen our industry-leading commercial engine and the trusted partner status we've learned with our customers. Our customers rely on us to help accelerate their innovation, increase their productivity, and advance their important work. I spent a lot of time connecting with customers to understand their near and long-term priorities, so that we can enable their success. As a result of these unique relationships, we continue to advance our capabilities to be an even stronger partner for our customers. Let me give you a couple of examples from the second quarter. We expanded our leading clinical trial supply services with a new ultra-cold facility in Bleiswijk in the Netherlands to offer pharma and biotech customers tailored end-to-end support throughout the clinical supply chain for high-value therapies, including cell and gene therapies, biologics, antibodies, and vaccines. We also opened a state-of-the-art innovation lab at our site in Center Valley, Pennsylvania to showcase our innovative solutions for global clinical trial supply, including new packaging solutions, real-time tracking and tracing, and enhanced clinical trial setup and planning. In addition, we advance partnerships and collaborations with our customers during the quarter. Let me give you a couple of examples in the Asia Pacific region. To support Indonesia's growing investments in healthcare, scientific research, and renewable energy, we further expanded our presence and capabilities in the country. We are collaborating with the National Battery Research Institute to advance battery technology and energy storage, as well as with the Mandaya Hospital Group to help advance stem cell research and cell therapy development. In Singapore, we announced a collaboration with the National University Hospital in Mirxes, a local RNA technology company to develop and clinically validate advanced next generation sequencing genomic testing solutions specifically made to address the needs of the Southeast Asian population. So another strong quarter of executing our growth strategy. Let me now turn to our PPI business system, which enabled excellent execution during the quarter. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day. During the quarter, I had the opportunity to see the PPI efforts to further improve manufacturing of our lab equipment products, and I came away incredibly impressed with the progress to drive operational efficiency in this business. It's also great to see how PPI has been adopted in our clinical research business where it is driving meaningful improvements in our efficiency and customer allegiance. Ultimately, you see the positive impact of our PPI business system and our Q2 results reflected in strong profitability and cashflow that we delivered in the quarter. We also advanced our corporate social responsibility priorities during the quarter. As a mission driven company, we helped to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also create a positive impact by supporting our communities and being a good steward of our planet. We continue to make progress on our environmental sustainability roadmap in Q2. As part of our commitment to safeguarding the world's natural resources, we have set targets for 2025, which include zero waste certification for 30 manufacturing and warehouse sites. During the quarter, three more of our sites achieve zero waste certification, and we're on track to achieve our goals. You can learn much more about our progress in our 2023 Corporate Social Responsibility Report, which was published during the quarter. The report provides a transparent account of our journey as we fulfill our commitments to society and all of our stakeholders. Let me now give you an update on capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. Shortly after the quarter ended, we completed our acquisition of Olink, and it was great to welcome our new colleagues to the company earlier this month. As you know, Olink is a leading provider of next generation proteomic solutions. The addition of Olink\u2019s proven and transformative technology is highly complementary to our industry leading mass spectrometers. Olink further advances our leadership as it is a great addition to our differentiated protein research ecosystem. Our world-class commercial engine will enable us to bring this technology to scientists around the world. By increasing the use of next-gen proteomics and providing industry-leading data quality at scale, excuse me, data quality at scale, we're in a great position to further enhance the understanding of human biology and meaningfully accelerate scientific breakthroughs. So as I reflect on the quarter, I'm proud of what our team accomplished and grateful to their contributions for our success. Let me now turn to our guidance. Given our strong performance in the second quarter, we're raising our 2024 guidance. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $42.4 billion to $43.3 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $21.29 to $22.07 per share. Stephen will take you through the details in his remarks. So to summarize our key takeaways from Q2, we delivered another quarter of strong results driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI business system. We continue to enable our customer success and this reinforces our trusted partner status and industry leadership. Our strong results in Q2 allowed us to raise our guidance again for the year. We're well positioned to deliver differentiated performance in 2024 as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Mark and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our second quarter results for the total company, then provide color on our four business segments. And I'll conclude by providing our updated 2024 guidance. Before I get into the details of our financial performance, let me provide you with a high level view on how the second quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. As Mark mentioned in the quarter, market conditions were as we'd expected, yet another quarter of excellent execution, and this enabled us to deliver Q2 financials ahead of what we'd assumed in our prior guidance. Starting with the top line, core organic revenue growth was a little over 0.5 percentage point ahead of what we'd assumed in the prior guide for Q2. That translates to approximately $60 million of revenue, which is partially offset by slightly higher FX revenue headwind. Turning to the bottom line, adjusted EPS was $0.25 ahead of what we'd assumed in the prior guide for Q2. $0.08 was from strong operational performance; $0.06 cents was from favorable effects and timing of discrete tax planning benefits within the year; and $0.11 was from the beat -- was from lower net interest expense. In my prior guidance I took a prudent approach to the Olink transaction from a financing cost standpoint. We're also executing well on free cash flow generation. The year-to-date free cash flow is 68% higher than the same period last year. So we're continuing to deliver strong performance and we're well positioned at the halfway point of the year. Let me now provide you with some additional details on Q2. Beginning with the earnings per share. In the quarter adjusted EPS grew by 4% to $5.37. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.04, up 15% from Q2 last year. On the top line, in Q2 reported revenue was 1% lower year-over-year. The components of our Q2 report of revenue change included 1% lower organic revenue, a 1% headwind from foreign exchange, and a slight contribution from acquisitions. We delivered another strong sequential improvement in core organic revenue growth this quarter. And in Q2, core organic revenue growth rounded up to flat on a year-over-year basis. In the quarter, pandemic-related revenue was approximately $115 million, this was mainly from vaccines and therapies. This represents a 3% headwind to organic revenue growth. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, in Q2 North America declined mid-single-digits, Europe grew low-single-digits, and Asia Pacific grew mid-single-digits, which includes China, which also grew mid-single-digits. With respect to our operational performance, we delivered $2.3 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 22.3%, 10 basis points higher than Q2 last year and 30 basis points higher than Q1 2024. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 42.1%, 110 basis points higher than Q2 last year. In the quarter, we continue to deliver very strong productivity, reflecting our continued focus on cost management, as well as the carryover benefit from the cost actions put in place last year. This enabled us to more than offset the impact of low volumes, while appropriately funding investments to further advance our industry leadership. Moving on to the details of P&L, adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.6% of revenue. Total R&D expense was $340 million in Q2, reflecting our ongoing investments in high impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 7.1% in the quarter. Looking at results below the line, our Q2 net interest expense was $59 million, which is $89 million lower than Q2 2023, due to higher cash and investment balances. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10%. And average diluted shares were 383 million in Q2, approximately 5 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to free cash flow and the balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow from operations was $3.2 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow was $2.6 billion after investing $630 million of net capital expenditures. We enter the quarter with $8.8 billion in cash and short-term investments and $35.4 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.3 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.5 times on a net debt basis. Including my comments on our total company performance suggested ROIC was 11.8%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on our performance of our four business segments, starting with life sciences solutions. Q2 reported revenue in the segment declined 4% and organic revenue was 3% lower than the prior year quarter. Growth in this segment was led by a biosciences business that was more than offset by the impact of the pandemic. Q2 adjusted operating income for life science solutions increased 6% and adjusted operating margin was 36.7%, up 350 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During Q2, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity, which was partially upset by unfavorable volume pull through. The team continued to do an excellent job to appropriately manage the cost base and deal with the unwind of the pandemic. In the analytical instrument segment, reported revenue grew 2% and organic growth was 3% higher than the prior year quarter. We continue to deliver a very strong growth in our electron microscopy business. In this segment, Q2 adjusted operating income increased 1% and adjusted operating margin was 24.6%, 10 basis points lower year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable mix and strategic investments. Turning to specialty diagnostics, in Q2 both reported and organic revenue were 1% higher than the prior year quarter. In Q2, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core, led by our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostic businesses, as well as in our healthcare market channel. Q2 adjusted operating income for specialty diagnostics increased 1% and adjusted operating margin was 26.7%, which was flat, compared to Q2 2023. During the quarter, we delivered good productivity, which was offset by strategic investment. And finally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, both reported revenue and organic growth decreased 1% in Q2 versus the prior year quarter. This is driven by the runoff of vaccines and therapies revenue. Growth in this segment in Q2 was led by a clinical research business. Q2 adjusted operating income declined 10% and adjusted operating margin was 12.9%, which is 120 basis points lower than Q2 2023, flat sequentially to Q1 2024. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix and strategic investments. Turning now to guidance, as Mark outlined, given our strong performance in Q2, we're raising our 2024 full-year guidance. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $42.4 billion to $43.3 billion, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $21.29 to $22.07. The improved revenue guidance does not change the core organic revenue growth rounding for the year, so we still continue to assume core organic revenue growth will be in the range of minus 1% to positive 1% for 2024. And we continue to assume that the market declines low-single-digits this year. Our proven growth strategy and PPI business system execution will enable us to continue to take share once again. Our 2024 updated guidance range assumes an adjusted operating income margin between 22.5% and 22.8%, slightly higher than the prior guide. Our PPI business system is continuing to enable excellent execution, manage costs appropriately and fund the right long-term investments to enable us to further advance our industry leadership. We now expect net interest costs to be in the range of $380 million to $400 million for the year. And the raise to our adjusted EPS guidance range reflects a $0.15 increase on the low end and a $0.05 increase on the high end, which results in an increase in the midpoint by $0.10. So another strong quarter of execution, enabling an increase in the guidance outlook for the year, we remain really well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance. I thought it would be helpful to remind you of some of the key underlying assumptions behind the guide that remain unchanged from the previous guidance. In 2024, we're assuming just under $100 million of testing revenue and $300 million to $400 million of vaccines and therapies related revenues. In total, this represents a year-over-year headwind of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, or 3% of revenue. We assume that FX would be roughly neutral year-over-year to both revenue and adjusted EPS, and we're assuming that the $0.03 FX adjusted EPS beat that we saw in Q2 is offset for the remainder of the year, leading to no change for the year as a whole for FX versus the prior guidance. We continue to expect adjusted income tax rate will be 10.5% in 2024, and for the year we're assuming between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in net capital expenditures and free cash flow in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion. In terms of capital deployment, we're assuming $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. Expect to return approximately $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends and we deployed $3.1 billion to acquire Olink shortly after the Q2 close. Full-year average diluted share count is assumed to be approximately 383 million shares. Finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing to help you with your modeling. Relative to the midpoint of the guide, I recommend modeling Q3 organic revenue growth 1% higher than we delivered in Q2. Also good to model core organic revenue growth in Q3 1% higher than we delivered in Q2. And in terms of adjusted EPS in Q3, I recommend modeling it to be just over 24% of the full-year. So to conclude, we continue to deliver on our commitments. And at the halfway point, we're in a great position to deliver differentiated performance for all our stakeholders in 2024. With that I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Rafael Tejada : Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Michael Ryskin : Great. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Marc, a high-level one for you to start off maybe, at our Vegas Health Care Conference in May, you made some initial comments about 2025 market expectations. And you said that you expect the tools market next year would be just below the 4 to 6 level it has historically been. Just given the way the year is playing out, how you're exiting 2024, entering 2025. It's been a couple months since then. You've got hopefully a clearer view of how 2024 is going to play out. So given where you sit now, do you have more confidence in that 2025 market assumption and maybe how Thermal can deliver differentiated performance above that? Marc Casper : Mike, thanks for the question. It was a pleasure to be in with you earlier in the quarter. So let me start actually one level off. Just kind of frame a few of my general thoughts and I'll talk about 2025. So when I think about Q2, team executed really well, really good financial performance. It was ahead of our expectations. It allowed us to raise our guidance. The other aspect of the performance is the actual performance as opposed to relative to expectations. Clearly very differentiated and very strong. It was good to see that core has now elevated to it's now flat, which is great. 4% adjusted EPS growth and expansion of margins. So I feel very good about the performance and when I think about the market they were in line with our expectations, so it's good to see the visibility that we've enjoyed for decades, as returned in terms of how the market's playing out. And when I think about our own performance within the markets, it was good to see that all four of our markets, we had sequential improvement in our growth across all four. So really very positive development. PPI business system is really delivering outstanding impact and ultimately feel good about the performance. Capital deployment has been active and good. We've deployed over $6 billion of capital through the first-half of the year, half of it on return of capital and half of it on a very exciting acquisition of Olink, and we're very well positioned at this point to deliver strong results. When I think about 2025, I think the way I would just think about it is we're going give you that in January of 2025. When we have the benefit of the year behind us and we're focused on delivering a great year, we'll be able to give you a view of not only our performance, but how we saw the underlying market conditions. The year is progressing as we expected, so we expect that the market will continue to improve modestly in the back half of the year, each quarter being a little better than the quarter before and that our performance will also continue to step up and that will give us momentum going at \u201825 in the details. We'll give you back -- we'll give you in a few months\u2019 time. Michael Ryskin : Okay, fair enough. And then for my follow-up, I want to focus on China, I think if I heard correctly, you called out that it grew mid-single-digits in the quarter. I want to make sure I heard that right. But if so, that's a bit surprising. Anything you could say in terms of what you're seeing there? Is that also ahead of your expectations and is this just a temporary bump in the quarter or something one-timey or are you seeing some real traction here and you think that can get you into your end? Thanks. Marc Casper : Yes, your hearing is excellent. So yes, we delivered mid-single-digit growth in the quarter. Team did a nice job, really good execution. Comparison was relatively easy in the quarter, so and I would still characterize the conditions as muted in terms of the environment, but a nice job by the team to deliver a very solid Q2 result. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question is from Jack Meehan. Jack, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Thanks. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to start by asking about LSS, so this had some nice sequential improvement in the growth rate. I heard biosciences led to growth. Can you talk about the relative improvement you're seeing there, or also genetic sciences and bioprocessing? And any updates on where you think your customers stand in terms of e-stock? Marc Casper : Yes, Jack, thanks for the question. When I think about probably the most important points on our life science solutions segment, nice to see the growth in our biosciences business, that's every lab every day, really nice adoption in the pharma and biotech segment there. So that was a nice positive development in terms of there. And maybe I'll dive a little bit into bioproduction, which is always an area of great interest to our investors. The business is actually progressing really exactly as we expected, really nice quarter of performance. So when I think about the most salient facts around bioproduction, sequentially really nice revenue growth in Q2. When I look at orders, we had really nice sequential growth in orders. We had year-over-year growth in orders, and we had a favorable book-to-bill. So progressing well, and when I look at others that have reported I feel very good about our performance. So when I think about the life science solution segment those are two of the drivers and then you've seen some announcements in the previous few months about important companion diagnostics our clinical sequence business -- clinical sequencing business is doing quite well. So Jack thanks for the question on LSS. Jack Meehan : Excellent okay and then one to rotate to AI, so this also came in a bit better than I was expecting. Can you talk about how the book-to-bill was in the segment in the quarter? And just update some customer spending patterns? Thanks. Marc Casper : Yes. So when I think about Analytical Instruments, it was nice to see the 3% growth in the quarter and very positive. Yes, I would say the market conditions also are playing out pretty much as we expected and not at the normal levels yet, and we certainly see the impact of the muted conditions in China. We have really excellent momentum in those differentiated products that we have where innovation matters, on orders as well as on revenue. When you look at electron microscopy, you look at the Orbitrap Astral, just the cutting-edge work, you've seen incredibly strong momentum there. So that's where the highlights are, and I would say in the more routine-ish aspects of the portfolio, you see more muted conditions. Thanks, Jack. Operator : Our next question is from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Rachel, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Rachel Vatnsdal : Perfect. Hi, good morning, you guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Wanted to follow-up on some of the China comments. You mentioned that China grew mid-single-digits, partly due to the comp there. Can you just walk us through what are you seeing from China stimulus? We heard that this first tranche of funding was released earlier this quarter. So have you seen any orders related to China stimulus? Do you think that you'll benefit from this first tranche? And then also, have you seen any customers holding back spending related to the stimulus program? Kind of getting at this like air pocket that we've heard some of your peers talk about. Any comments there would be helpful. Marc Casper : Rachel, thanks for the question. It's an important question. So let me start at the sort of high level and then get down to the stimulus and then try to as much transparency as I possibly can. First of all, I think the world was surprised at how weak China was economically as this year unfolded. The stimulus programs announced early in the year was a sign that the government wanted to get the economy going, which is a good thing, right, in terms of sort of what is the macro backdrop in terms of a tough economic environment. When I think about stimulus in our industry and what we're seeing, tremendous amount of activity with our customers actually to help them with figuring out what to apply for. And so we know there's quite a bit of interest in our products from a stimulus perspective, and we're helping our customers in that process. When I think about how do I expect it to play out, my expectation is that it's largely going to show up in revenue in 2025 and likely to have some small effect in the fourth quarter of 2024 as well. I did ask the question about air pocket to the team, and I'm actually heading off to China in a couple of weeks' time, so I'm looking forward to that. Our team didn't highlight any air pocket or anything like that. So it's kind of muted conditions, and customers are working on looking at the investments associated with the additional government funding. So we didn't see any pauses in the activity, and I'm proud of the team's mid-single-digit growth in the quarter. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. And then just as my follow-up here. On the CRO, you called out clinical research was an outperformer this quarter that drove some of the growth. So we've seen a few volatile prints from your peers. So can you walk us through what have you seen from an RFP standpoint and book-to-bill in the quarter for PPD? And then have we turned the quarter on emerging biotech funding and kind of how is that flowing through the model as well? Marc Casper : Yes. So Rachel, team has done a really nice job executing very well in our clinical research business. And when I think about our performance, we delivered positive organic revenue growth despite a really substantial headwind from the runoff of vaccines and therapies in that activity. So team is doing a nice job. Commercial execution was very strong in the quarter, right? And customers value our capabilities. And when I sort of went under the details of the commercial performance and looked at some of the underlying trends, it was very clear that in Q2, we really did see some of the biotech funding activity that we talked about is a green shoot in Q1 that would give us confidence that the year in aggregate across our business would be improving from a market perspective. We saw that in Q2 actually translate into an acceleration of authorizations in our biotech customer base. And that really does bode well for that. And as you know well this business, that really translates more into revenue in \u201825 and \u201826 in terms of how long it takes to get the clinical trials up and going, but the authorization momentum very encouraging in the quarter. Thank you, Rachel. Operator : The next question is from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Doug, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Doug Schenkel : Okay, thank you and good morning everybody. Marc, when we look at two-year stacks and calculate CAGRs going back pre-pandemic, it seems like most business lines within Thermo continue to trend positively. I think your commentary is consistent with that on the call this morning. With that in mind, I think one of the key questions is, what's going to be the pace of improvement from here? So with that in mind, two questions. First, where is the recovery occurring more quickly than you may have expected? Where are things lagging? And I'm kind of thinking about this both in terms of how you guided for the year, but also just based on what you've seen through previous cycles. So that's one question. And then the second would be just keeping in mind your assumption that this market grows 4% to 6% on a normalized basis, is it fair to assume that recognizing you're making progress here, but just seeing what the pacing is, is it fair to assume that the move back into that range is going to be gradual versus a snapback? And essentially that this move into the 4% to 6% range, it's going to take several quarters? Marc Casper : Yes. So Doug, there's a lot in that question. It's a good question. So let me just start with I think the things that are around the market and our performance which is important to our investors, right? Pre-2023, holding aside some of the amazing market and our performance in the pandemic period, a very predictable, visible market without a lot of volatility and really a great underlying set of growth, right? So there's never debates about market growth sort of pre-pandemic or even in the early parts of the pandemic. So -- and then obviously, a difficult year for the industry in 2023, comparisons and a lot of other factors related to the pandemic directly and indirectly. So when I think about what we're seeing in the industry now for three quarters in a row, the visibility is pretty good. Like we have a good feel for what's going on. It's playing out as we expected. There's always things a little better, a little worse, also irrelevant on the margin. They're all in the factor of the aggregate, so I feel very good about the progression. What's embedded in our guidance in the market, right, is that for the full-year is that it continues to step up a little bit more in Q3 and further in Q4. And when I think about what we've assumed in the market growth and back in the January time frame when we gave our guidance is we said the market was going to be down low-single-digits. But when you looked at sort of the phasing implied, it probably is flattish, maybe up slightly in the fourth quarter in terms of the market progression. That's -- we don't have a perfect crystal ball, but that's sort of what's implied in there. And so it's progressing well. When I think to how it's going to progress exactly each quarter thereafter, when we get to January, I will have a much better feel for it. But I think what's really relevant is how do I feel about the 4% to 6%, right? And I'm looking forward to Investor Day. I feel great about the long-term 4% to 6%. That doesn't mean I can predict it to a quarter or the specific year, but when talking a three to five-year time frame, and do I believe that the market growth is going to be 4% to 6%, 100% confidence in that. But underlying scientific drivers are phenomenal in terms of our industry, what's going on in pipelines, our customer base, fantastic, right? So I don't lose any sleep over that. And I always question it because it's important. It's not like just take it from a dramatic standpoint, but from a fact and underlying drivers, I feel great about it. And then the other thing that's important to me, important to our 125,000 colleagues and actually quite important to our investors is our customers meaningfully choosing us more often than their other choices. And the ability to grow 2% faster than the market, I feel great about. And we have an incredible track record this quarter, at least looking at what we've seen so far, once again delivered on that. So hopefully, that puts it in the context of my enthusiasm. And we'll provide you transparency as the year wraps up to what do we see as a reasonable assumption for the next year. And I think our forecast accuracy is pretty good. Douglas Schenkel : Okay. And Marc, if I can ask one more high-level follow-up. Over the years and in working with you and following Thermo, one of the neat things has been in these tougher periods in the market, Thermo and you specifically have -- you've played offense when others have played defense. Recognizing every cycle is difficult and different, I would say the last 1.5 years has been maybe tougher than normal even for Thermo. As things start to improve a little bit, but again, it's gradual, do you feel you're in a position now to maybe get even more aggressive like you have in previous cycles when it comes to capital deployment, evolving the business and other initiatives? Are you feeling more comfortable, more confident in making those moves that we've seen in prior cycles? Thank you. Marc Casper : Doug, thanks for the question. When I think about the company's strategy and the trusted partner status that we've earned with our customers over many, many years, we're able to take a long-term perspective, while holding ourselves accountable for delivering excellent long-term results. And I love periods where not everybody is performing at the same level. It creates opportunities. I loved during the fact that the pandemic, we were able to accelerate our investments in innovation. Well, I mean I talked probably for five of my 15 minutes today on innovation. And I had to truncate it because the list was so long. It is super cool. And our job is to differentiate our competitive position to deliver superior organic growth to the others and translate into great results. And I'm very excited about our ability to continue to do that and further differentiate our industry leadership going forward. So thanks for the question, Doug. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question is from Tycho Peterson. Tyco, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson : Thanks. Hey, Marc, a question on operating margins or maybe for Stephen. Lab products and services, obviously, you felt the headwinds from the vaccine and therapy roll off, but it was effectively at a two-year low. So just curious about how you think about margin for lab products going forward? And then as we think about 2025, if TPD and Patheon can grow above the corporate average, do you still have the ability to drive 40 to 50 bps of margin expansion or potentially could be higher or lower? Thanks. Stephen Williamson : Tycho, thanks for the question, and good to hear from you again. So in terms of the margin profile in the quarter, we're going through largely the impact of the transition of the vaccine-related capacity in sterile fill finish and translating into other modalities. So that's probably the biggest factor that you see there. And I think about the margin profile for our businesses, I feel good about the ability to drive strong margin expansion as we -- the top line growth comes back in certain parts of the business where we've appropriately adjusted the cost base down and where volumes have come down. And as those volumes come back, we're going to get some good pull-through that comes from that. So look forward to giving the details on '25 when we get to the January call. But yes, in terms of the margin profile and kind of the mix of business, I feel good about the ability to expand our margins. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then one follow-up on CDMO capacity. You doubled fill finish over the last couple of years. Just curious, Marc, how you think about additional capacity expansion, how you think about capacity utilization in the industry and how actively you may look at some of the capacity that could get freed up from some of the recent M&A or potentially around biosecure in the U.S? Marc Casper : Yes. So Tycho, when I think about our pharma services business and our capacity, where we play, I feel very good about our position. We've had very strong demand for our sterile fill finish abilities, which is our largest activity, and we're doing well there. We've been expanding the number of lines we have at our sites, and demand has been strong for that. So I feel good about that outlook. In the clinical trials, supplies, which is the other really large portion of our business and where we really have an unparalleled position, I highlighted a couple of examples of capabilities we're expanding. Effectively, we make sure that our capacity lines up with our forecasted demand. So it's not really an overcapacity viewpoint. And then on the other parts of the business, I feel okay about our position and nothing of note there. So that's pretty positive. And what we're going through right now, as a reminder, is we're transitioning a lot of the COVID-related activities to the normal therapies. And the team is doing a good job. It certainly impacts our growth in terms of headwind in 2024, but it becomes better in '25 and '26 as the new therapies and the tech transfers are complete and new lines come on place. So pretty good times ahead. Tycho Peterson : Thanks, I appreciate the color. Marc Casper : Thanks, Tyco. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Puneet, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda : Yes. Hi, thanks Marc and Stephen. Thanks for taking the question. So Marc, a higher-level question for you, maybe with your -- when you have conversations, the C-suite conversation with therapeutics teams out there, what are you seeing and hearing from your larger biopharma customers, and maybe to some extent, these mid-cap ones as well versus the smaller and earlier-stage customers? How much of a divergence are you seeing within these groups? And when can that divergence narrow? Marc Casper : Yes. So Puneet, thanks for the question. So when I think about the things that jump out to me the patterns, if you will, and I see lots of customers, and I'm looking forward to being back on the road tomorrow, seeing our customers is a great thing. In our larger customers, which -- and these will be the companies with many products that are both commercial and in their pipeline, you're seeing a few things. One, they're focused on resiliency of their supply chain. So where maybe historically pre-pandemic, they would have had single site in-house manufacturing, you're seeing much more of the second site, leveraging our capabilities. And that's great in terms of just making sure that they can meet their customer demand, if you will, for medicines. You're also seeing the desire for how do we help them be more innovative and productive. And you basically fund all of the exciting things in their pipeline by just helping them really prioritize the most important work and do that in the most effective way. So it's really about helping them do more to maximize the impact of what's in their pipeline. When I think about the smaller customers, because we had gone through a period in 2023 where funding was challenged, right, a lot of the tone was around how do they get through the period. When I think about the first six months of dialogue, much higher confidence, right? Funding is happening, but also the confidence that funding will be available really at a very different spot. And you're seeing that really translate into the earliest indicators of that, which is authorizations of new clinical trials and new activity. But I would expect that, that would sort of flow through the rest of the types of work we do as the year continues to unfold and as we get into '25. So I think that's a very positive development. Puneet Souda : Okay. Great. And just a follow-up for Stephen. On the EPS beat, it was about $0.25 at the midpoint and -- but you raised the guide only by $0.10. So just wondering how much of that is a reflection of the end market versus what's within your control in terms of cost management? Or is there anything specific that you would point out to? Stephen Williamson : Yes. So Puneet, so $0.06 of the beating in Q2 is really timing-related. When I think about the FX rates and kind of the outlook for the rest of the year, $0.03 of that $0.06 could be offset in the second-half. And then from a tax standpoint, we're not assuming the change in the overall rate for the year. That's timing with that. So that $0.06 is good beat in Q2, but it's net neutral for the year as a whole. And then with the rest, we've raised the low end $0.15, and we raised at the high end $0.05. And I think that's a strong raise at this point and think it's appropriate and enables us to be better positioned for the second half of the year. And I wouldn't really read anything else into that. It's just -- I think that's just appropriate at this point. Puneet Souda : Got it. Okay, thank you. Rafael Tejada : Operator we have time for one more question. Operator : Yes, Our next question is from Dan Arias with Stifel. Dan, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Dan Arias : Good morning, guys. Marc, where do you think the academic markets are headed here? Some mixed data points there, and AH budget isn't particularly robust this year. So curious what expectations we should have for the second half and then into the next cycle. Marc Casper : Yes. I was encouraged by what I saw in academic and government in Q2. We had low single-digit growth, a relatively challenging comparison. So the team did a good job. What I'm seeing is on the high-end differentiated products, customers are getting money. I mean if I think through, consumers get money for the really great innovation. And given our track record on innovation, we're seeing strong demand for the Orbitrap Astral. And I know that there's a lot of excitement around the Thermo Scientific Stellar mass spectrometer and the eclipse series. These are really -- or series. These are really, really positive developments. And so I think it's good. I always think long-term academic and government globally, it was kind of a low-single-digit growth market, sometimes a little better than that. And for -- our performance is playing out in line with that right now. Dan Arias : Okay. And then if I -- just as a follow-up on your comments on China stimulus and the ability to see money gets spent there. Do you see that as primarily just a function of time, customers need time to have it flow and get to them? Or are there sort of discrete triggers and specific things that need to happen in order to have demand to actually make its way to you? Thanks. Marc Casper : I mean the process is they have to apply, and there's a central government funding and matched by their other funding sources, usually provincial or it could be local depending on the institution. So they're going through that process. As it gets approved, they then have the ability to go out and place the order, so that's the view. I think because these institutions are funded by the government in all times, whether it's stimulus or not, I think they have a mechanism to understand what's likely to happen. So this is not giant mystery to them. I think they're working through it and is kind of normal from that perspective. And what we're doing is reminding them of the importance of the important instrumentation that we've launched and the relevance of it. So that they prioritize their funding request to support our instrumentation. Dan, thanks for the question, and I'll turn to just wrapping up. So thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. Pleased to deliver another strong quarter, well positioned to deliver differentiated performance as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders, and we'll build an even brighter future for our company. We're looking forward to talking about that bright future at our upcoming Investor Day on September 19 in New York and updating you on our third quarter performance in October. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Thermo Fisher Scientific 2024 Third Quarter Conference Call. My name is Ezra and I will be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may begin the call. Rafael Tejada : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investor section of our website thermofisher.com, under the heading News, Events, and Presentations until November 6, 2024. A copy of the press release of our third quarter 2024 earnings is available in the investor section of our website under the heading financials.

Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which are on file with the SEC and available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials, SEC Filings. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today. Also, during this call, we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our third quarter 2024 earnings and also in the investor section of our website under the heading financials. So with that I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our third-quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. We're seeing the benefit of our trusted partner status, which is resonating strongly with our customers and we're continuing to deliver differentiated performance in the short-term, while further strengthening our long-term competitive position. So first, let me recap the financials. Our revenue in the quarter was $10.6 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.36 billion, adjusted operating margin was 22.3% and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.28 per share. Our performance in the third quarter is allowing us to raise our adjusted EPS guidance once again and continues our track record of delivering differentiated results. Turning to our performance by end market. In the third quarter, underlying market conditions played out as we'd expected and we delivered another quarter of sequential improvement in growth. Let me provide you with some additional context. Starting with pharma and biotech, we declined in the low-single-digits in Q3, including a five point headwind from the runoff of vaccines and therapy revenue. This marks the third quarter in a row of sequential improvement in growth for this customer segment. Performance in the quarter was led by our research and safety market channel and our clinical research business. In academic and government, we grew in the low-single-digits during the quarter. We delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy business and in our research and safety market channel. In industrial and applied, we grew in the low-single-digits during the quarter, highlighted by strong growth in our electron microscopy business. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, growth was flat for the quarter. As a reminder, the reported growth in this end market is impacted by the runoff of COVID-19 testing-related revenue. During the quarter, the team delivered good revenue growth in our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses, as well as the healthcare market channel. As I reflect on the end markets, underlying conditions have modestly improved each quarter as the year has progressed. This is in line with the framing we provided as part of the guidance at the beginning of the year. Let me now turn to an update on our growth strategy. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars : high impact innovation; our trusted partner status with customers; and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar, it was another great quarter of innovation. First, we continue to see the impact of our innovations launched over the past couple of years. It's gratifying that our innovations continue to receive industry recognition. This is a true testament to our teams. Most recently, the R&D 100 Awards, which recognizes the most revolutionary products in science and technology, honor two of our products, our Gibco CTS Detachable Dynabeads, which launched last year, as well as our Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral Mass spectrometer, which won gold in the market disruptors special recognition category as one of the most significant advancements in mass spectrometry in 15-years. Adoption of the Orbitrap Astral continues to be incredibly strong. During my customer interactions, I've had the opportunity to hear direct feedback on how significant our continued innovation is in helping our customers move science forward and advance their important work. The second part of innovation is we also had the benefit of a number of high-impact new products this quarter that we launched. To enable the development of advanced materials, we launched the Thermo Scientific Iliad scanning transmission electron microscope, which integrates a number of our advanced analytical technologies into a seamless and user-friendly workflow. This offers researchers deeper insights into the chemical nature of the most sophisticated advanced materials down to the atomic level. The Iliad incorporates our most innovative high-resolution spectrometer to accurately determine the composition of materials, as well as our proprietary energy filter for detailed imaging and chemical analysis of samples. We recently unveiled Iliad at the European Microscopy Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the feedback has been incredibly positive. Turning to innovations in life sciences within our biosciences business, we launched the Applied Biosystems MagMAX Sequential DNA/RNA kit, which maximizes the isolation of DNA and RNA from blood cancer samples, helping researchers identify unique insights of cancer-causing genetic alterations. And we also launched the Invitrogen Vivofectamine Delivery Solutions, a novel method for delivering nucleic acids into multiple targets with therapeutic effect, paving the way for groundbreaking new medicines. Let me give you a quick update on our progress in building on the trusted partner status that we've earned with our customers. Last month at our Investor Day, you heard us highlight this element of our growth strategy and I'd like to bring some additional context to bring it to life. During the quarter, I had the opportunity to meet with many of our customers. As you know, we have an unparalleled customer access and this helps us understand their near and long-term priorities. Our scale, depth of capabilities and accumulated experience is truly resonating with customers as they rely on us to accelerate their innovation, enhance their productivity and advance their important work. This translated into meaningful commercial wins with customers during the quarter, which speaks to the ongoing strength of our growth strategy and our ability to gain share now and in the future. I also visited China in August and spent time meeting with government officials and customers. We have strong relationships there based on our track record of positive impact and our long history in the country. Our conversations were focused on how we can collaborate to enable our customer success. I came away from the visit, seeing firsthand how well-positioned we are to capitalize on the market opportunities when the economy picks up in China. Let me now give you an example from the third quarter and how we advanced customer partnerships and collaborations. In our clinical next-gen sequencing business, we announced our partnership with the National Cancer Institute, myeloMATCH precision medicine umbrella trial. That's going to leverage our next-generation sequencing technology to test patients for specific biomarkers, so they can be matched more quickly with optimal treatments based on their unique cancer profiles. We also continue to expand our capabilities to meet our customers' current and future needs. To enhance our oral solid dose formulation capabilities for our pharma and biotech customers, we expanded our pharma services manufacturing footprint in Cincinnati, Ohio and Bend, Oregon. In our clinical research business, we announced the expansion of our global laboratory services network with a new bioanalytical lab in Gothenburg, Sweden, which will support pharmaceutical and biotech customers with advanced laboratory services to support all phases of development. So it was an excellent quarter of advancing our growth strategy. Let me give you a quick update on the impact of our PPI business system in Q3. PPI is embedded in our culture and there are many examples that I could share from the quarter. As always, our PPI business system and our mission-driven culture enabled our success during the quarter. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day to enable outstanding execution. Ultimately, you see the positive impact of PPI reflected in the strong profitability and cash flow that we delivered in the quarter. During the quarter, we further enhanced our supply chain in Asia-Pacific by optimizing inventory across our network. While in Europe, we further streamlined and automated our manufacturing processes for high-end analytical instruments to meet strong demand. Now let me turn to corporate social responsibility. We have a CSR strategy that delivers competitive advantage. As a mission-driven company, we help to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also create a positive impact by the environment we create for our colleagues, how we support our communities and being a good steward of our planet. Today, I just want to spend a moment on our colleagues, because none of our success is possible without the work of our amazing team around the world. Our colleague safety is always our top priority and the impact of Hurricane Helene was especially concerning to me as we have about 1,000 colleagues in Asheville, North Carolina, one of the hardest hit areas. In Asheville, we manufacture lab equipment and have a customer service center. I'm so grateful our colleagues there are safe. I'm also thankful for the support of our extended teams, who have provided assistance to those colleagues impacted. It's truly heartwarming to see how our team comes together to support each other. Turning now to capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy to create tremendous value. We do this through a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. Let me update you on our recent acquisitions. The Binding Site now our protein diagnostics business continues to perform exceptionally well. In the quarter, we achieved an IVDR claim extension in the European Union for our Optilite Freelight MX Kappa Kit. Until now, these kits have been solely used in multiple myeloma diagnostics and monitoring. The extension now allows for the product to aid in the diagnosis of neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis. This is an excellent example of our M&A approach enabling a great business to be even better under our ownership, creating value for all stakeholders. As a reminder, we closed the acquisition of Olink at the beginning of the quarter. The integration is progressing smoothly. The business is well-positioned for a bright future. As you heard at our Investor Day, we're excited by the role we're playing in advancing proteomics research. As I reflect on the quarter, I'm proud of what our teams accomplished and grateful for their contributions to our success. Let me now turn to our guidance. Given our strong performance in the third quarter, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance, which we now expect to be in the range of $21.35 to $22.07 and we continue to expect revenue to be in the range of $42.4 billion to $43.3 billion. Stephen will take you through the details in his remarks. So to summarize our key takeaways from Q3, we delivered another strong quarter of financial results driven by our proven growth strategy and PPI business system. We continue to enable our customer success and this reinforces our trusted partner status and industry leadership. Our growth has been steadily increasing as we've gone through 2024 and we once again have raised our adjusted EPS guidance for the year. And we're well-positioned to deliver differentiated performance in 2024 as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our third quarter results for the total company and provide color on our four business segments. And I'll conclude by providing our updated 2024 guidance. Before I get into the details of our financial performance, let me provide you with a high-level view on how the third quarter played out versus what we'd assumed for Q3 in the midpoint of our prior guide. On the top line, both organic revenue growth and core organic revenue growth increased sequentially for the third consecutive quarter. Revenue was largely in line with what we'd assumed for Q3 in the midpoint of our prior guide. Turning to the bottom line, adjusted EPS was $0.06 ahead of what we'd assumed in the prior guide for Q3. That was a net impact of the following : $0.02 of strong operational performance, $0.06 of lower net interest cost due to favorable timing of cash flow generation and more favorable rates than has been assumed. These are partially offset by an additional $0.02 of FX headwind versus the assumption for the quarter. We're also executing well on free cash flow generation. Year-to-date free cash flow is 22% higher than the same period last year. So we had another strong quarter and are well-positioned to deliver differentiated financial performance in 2024. Let me now provide you with some additional details on Q3. Beginning with earnings per share, and in the quarter, adjusted EPS was $5.28, GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.25. On the top line, Q3 reported revenue, organic revenue and core organic revenue were all flat on a year-over-year basis. In the quarter, pandemic-related revenue was approximately $100 million. This was largely from vaccines and therapies. This represents a 3% headwind to organic revenue growth. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. In Q3, North America declined low-single-digits and Europe, Asia-Pacific and China within Asia-Pacific were all flat year-over-year. With respect to our operational performance, we delivered $2.36 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 22.3%, 190 basis points lower than Q3 last year, slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.8%, 20 basis points lower than Q3 last year. In the quarter, we continued to deliver strong productivity, reflecting our continued focus on cost management, this enabled us to fund strategic investments to further advance our industry leadership and partially offset the expected impact of unfavorable mix this quarter. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.2% of revenue. Total R&D expense was $346 million in Q3, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation and R&D as a percent of manufacturing revenue was 7.3% in the quarter. Looking at our results below the line, our Q3 net interest expense was $80 million, which is $33 million lower than Q3 2023 due to higher cash balances and short-term investments. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 10.5% and average diluted shares were $384 million in Q3, approximately $4 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. Turning to free cash flow and the balance sheet. Year-to-date free cash flow from operations was $5.4 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow was $4.5 billion and after investing $880 million of net capital expenditures. During the quarter, we deployed $3.1 billion of capital through the acquisition of Olink. And we ended the quarter with $6.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and $35.3 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.3 times debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and 2.7 times on a net debt basis. In concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 11.4%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on our performance of our four business segments, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q3 reported revenue in this segment declined 2% and organic revenue was 4% lower than the prior year quarter. Growth in this segment was driven by the impact of the pandemic. Q3 adjusted operating income for Life Sciences Solutions decreased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 35.4%, down 50 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During Q3, we delivered strong productivity, which was more than offset by unfavorable volume mix, retention costs related to the Olink acquisition and strategic invest. In the Analytical Instruments segment, both reported revenue and organic revenue grew 3% versus the prior year quarter. We continue to deliver very strong growth in our electron microscopy business. In this segment, Q3 adjusted operating income decreased 4% and adjusted operating margin was 24.9%, 180 basis points lower year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable mix and strategic investments. Turning to our Specialty Diagnostics segment, in Q3, both reported revenue and organic revenue grew 4% versus the prior year quarter. In Q3, we delivered strong growth and are led by our healthcare market channel and our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income for Specialty Diagnostics increased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 25.9%, 20 basis points lower than Q3 2023. And during the quarter, we delivered good productivity, which is more than offset by strategic investments. And finally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, both reported revenue and organic revenue were flat versus the prior year quarter. Organic growth in this segment was led by our research and safety market channel. The runoff of vaccines and therapies revenue had a mid-single-digit impact on the growth in this segment in Q3 and this was offset by very good underlying growth in our clinical research and pharma services businesses. And as expected, Q3 adjusted operating income declined 18% and adjusted operating margin was 13.5%, which is 290 basis points slower than Q3 2023. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by the expected unfavorable mix and strategic investments. Turning now to guidance, as Marc outlined, our strong performance in Q3, we're raising our 2024 full-year adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $21.35 to $22.07, which is a $0.03 increase at the midpoint. As we've done in the past two quarters, at the midpoint, we banked half of the Q3 beat and maintained the remainder as additional cushions for Q4. Revenue guidance continues to be in the range of $42.4 billion to $43.3 billion and we continue to assume the core organic revenue growth will be in the range of minus 1% to positive 1% for 2024. We also continue to assume that the market declines low-single-digits this year. Our proven growth strategy in PPI Business System execution is once again enabling us to take share. Our updated 2024 guidance continues to assume an adjusted operating income margin between 22.5% and 22.8%. And we now expect net interest cost to be in the range of $340 million to $380 million for the year. So another strong quarter, enabling an increase in the guidance outlook for the year. We remain well-positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance. So it would be helpful to remind you some of the key underlying assumptions behind the guide that remain unchanged from the previous guidance. In 2024, we're assuming just under $100 million of testing revenue and between $300 million to $400 million of vaccines and therapies related revenue. In total, this represents a year-over-year headwind of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion or 3% of revenue. We continue to expect the adjusted income tax rate will be 10.5% in 2024. And for the year, we're assuming between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in net capital expenditures and free cash flow in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion. In terms of capital deployment, we're assuming $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We returned $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends and in Q3, we deployed $3.1 billion to acquire Olink. Full-year average diluted share count is assumed to be approximately 383 million shares. And finally, as you think about the outlook for the year, you should consider the midpoint of our guidance range as the current view of the most likely outcome for the year. Implied in that midpoint is Q4 revenue of $11.3 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.96. That would reflect 2.5% organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is unchanged from the previous guidance and is a continuation of our sequential increase in growth that we delivered each quarter throughout the year. And as a reminder, Q4 organic revenue growth has the benefit of two extra selling days, which equates to approximately 1% and a headwind from vaccines and therapies of approximately 2.5%. So to conclude, we had another strong quarter and we're well positioned to deliver differentiated performance for all of our stakeholders in 2024. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Rafael Tejada : Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you very much. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Michael Ryskin : Great. Thank you, and thanks for taking the question. Marc, maybe kick things off with you. You talked a number of times during the prepared remarks about some sequential improvement as the year has gone on. And I think the view is that will continue into 4Q and into 2025? It looks like this continues to be a very gradual recovery, just a very slight step up in market conditions as we go through the year. No major changes, no step function change. Do you expect that pace of recovery to continue into the next quarter and into 2025, or do you think there could be an inflection at some point over the next two to four quarters where things accelerate a little bit? I guess, put another way, sort of what's holding the market back from a faster snapback? Marc Casper : Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. Good morning. So what I thought to do is maybe actually put some framing comments overall, then I'll get to your 2025 question as well. So for the Q&A session today, as I think about the third quarter as we sit here in October and how the year has progressed : first, it was a good quarter. And the market conditions, they've been in line with our expectations and they've been modestly improving as we progress through the year, which is what we expected to happen, so it's good that that's playing out that way. In Q3 for us, organic growth was flat. We were able to offset a three-point headwind from the runoff of COVID-19-related revenues. So it puts it in context of how we're performing. Each quarter, our organic growth has improved as the year has progressed. And I'm really quite excited by the fact that we're expecting the fourth quarter to return to growth organically, which is a good thing. Operationally, we're executing our proven growth strategy. We have strong financial management that's been able to allow us to increase our adjusted EPS guidance each quarter and kind of make all of this a non-event in terms of performance. So all of that is kind of the framing for the discussion today. So when I think about 2025 and I'll kind of -- just kind of boil it all together into sort of how do I think about the year. The first thing is, from our perspective, the best time to provide guidance is on our Q4 2024 call, which is in January. At that point, we're going to have the latest view of the market and the macro conditions and how ultimately we finish the year. And what we're going to approach it as the same as we did in 2024. We're going to give you our best thinking for the year ahead and then execute against it. From my own perspective and personally, I'm excited for 2025, right? And as I think about it in October, the end markets are modestly improving throughout the year. We're excited that in the fourth quarter, we're going to return to growth organically. For us in 2025, what I would say is that it's the final year of the runoff of the pandemic-related activity and while that'll still be a headwind to growth, it's going to be less than it was in 2024. And then I always think about how we're performing, right? And as a company, we're executing well. Our growth strategy is driving share gain. Our PPI Business System enables outstanding execution. We have a disciplined capital deployment strategy that generates returns. Our acquisitions are performing well. And we're going to be well-positioned to deliver differentiated performance once again in 2025. So we'll look forward to updating you on that in January as we have the best view of what the environment is. Michael Ryskin : Okay, all right. Thanks, I appreciate that. I guess for my follow-up, maybe we'll -- I want to dig a little into pharma and biotech. As a customer group, you talked about low-single-digit decline, and obviously, there's some headwind there from the COVID-19 runoff as well. But any additional color you can give on how that segment's performing, whether between larger pharma or smaller biotech, whether it's between some of the reagent and businesses in biosciences, versus the clinical trial business or the pharma services business, just that's been a focus point for investors, and would love to get some color on that? Marc Casper : So you're going to get a lot of fan mail from your peers on this call, sort of asking each of all the questions within pharma and biotech. I'll take a high-level shot at it. So first, when I think about the third quarter and how things progressed, you're seeing a sequential improvement, which is good. And when I think about underlying performance, right? We obviously had a mid-single-digit headwind from the pandemic runoff. So you're seeing that the conditions continue to improve. In aggregate, obviously, they're somewhat muted, because they're below the long-term expectations for the market growth, right? So that's nothing surprising where the positives are sort of the data points as we sit here, confidence in biotech is improving, funding in biotech in the industry has been modestly improving as the year progresses. So, it's definitely meaningfully better than it was in 2023. And when I think about the large pharma, in a way, I think it's kind of normal distribution amongst the different companies, some doing extraordinarily well, others adjusting to how their pipelines are performing. And customers have been adjusting to the IRA, and you see that in a more muted growth environment, but we're obviously incredibly well positioned with this customer base and we're clearly delivering differentiated performance relative to others. So the trusted partner status, our unique value proposition, these things resonate. So we feel good about the long-term health of pharma and biotech and how we're performing this year. Thanks, Mike. Michael Ryskin : Thank you. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Rachel, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Rachel Vatnsdal : Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions, you guys. First up on the CRO, maybe following up on some of your comments there about pharma versus biotech, but really specifically looking at PPD here. Could you give us an update on how much of PPD is indexed to large pharma customers versus biotech? And did you see any differences in trends across the two customer types this quarter within PPD? And then as a follow-up, some of your peers in the CRO sector have started to create some noise around their outlooks on 2025 and what that recovery looks like. So for Thermo, if PPD is more or less, let's call it a mid-single-digit business this year and normal is 8% for PPD, how are you thinking about the pace of recovery for PPD into 2025? Marc Casper : So, Rachel, thanks for the question. Good morning. When I think about our clinical research business, actually it's performing well. When I think about the business delivered growth in the quarter, it obviously has a meaningful headwind from the runoff of vaccines and therapies of CRO-related activity. So from that perspective, I feel good about how we're doing. Next quarter, I'm going to really spend some time talking about the magic that we're unlocking on the combination between our pharma services and our clinical research business and how that really adds differentiated value for our customers in terms of performance. So I want to focus on that one. We just announced how we talk about that to our customers. We've been doing this for quite some time and it's really been quite spectacular. So our momentum with the customer base is quite good and we're executing well. When I think about the -- our position, we have a slightly larger position serving biotech more broadly than we do serving pharma within clinical research in terms of the mix of the business, but both customer sets are very important. And when I think about some of the highlights, the biotech customers more quickly adopt that unified set of capabilities, because it's easier for them just organizationally to leverage all of pulling everything together one. So you're seeing that in authorizations and momentum, and biotech is particularly moving in the right direction. So that's how we see it. In terms of the 25% and long-term 8%, all of these things, we don't -- as you know, we're going to give our views on '25 next year. And we don't go -- we don't guide down to the business unit performance within the company, but we'll give the puts and takes of what's growing faster and what's growing at the average and what's growing more slowly than the average when we get to the guidance next year. Rachel Vatnsdal : Understood. And then on my second question, just around Life Science Solutions. So growth was a little softer than what the Street was looking for this quarter for that segment. We've heard from a few of your bioprocessing peers that pointed towards solid trends in 3Q -- so can you unpack for us the performance within that Life Sciences Solutions segment, how did bioproduction versus biosciences and genetic sciences trend in the quarter? And what, if anything, fall below your expectations there? Marc Casper : Yes, Rachel, thanks for the question, and thank you for the framing of the question. Because actually, the numbers are different than what seems to have been modeled in the analyst models, but actually, the business performed in line with our expectations for the quarter. So when I think about what happened in the quarter, in the third quarter, we had our largest impact of the COVID roll-off in this segment. That's something we knew, something -- that's why it came in line with our expectations relative to the other quarters. Q3 was the most difficult comparison in the COVID-related activities for us. So that probably explains a little bit of the modeling difference. In terms of how our business is performing, bioproduction is certainly the one that gets the most interest because there are a number of companies that are just bioproduction companies that have stocks out there. Actually, the quarter played out as we expected. It was nice to see strong momentum in orders, both sequentially and year-over-year. Revenue continues to progress in the right direction sequentially in terms of growth, and that obviously is going to be less of a headwind going forward and ultimately going to in not-distant future in terms of bioproduction, that's good. The only other commentary I would make on the LSS segment, it's not an enormous business, but our clinical sequencing business is doing really well, right? You see the announcements I talked about. One of them with the National Cancer Institute. You saw after the quarter-end, an announcement from one of our customers in terms of companion diagnostic approved using our sequencing for brain cancer. These are really positives in terms of customers applying our technology to make a huge difference on patient lives and the course of treatment, so that business is doing quite well. Thank you, Rachel. Operator : Our next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Marc Casper : Good morning, Jack. Jack Meehan : Maybe for Marc, I hate to ask a question about month-by-month dynamics, but can you just talk a little bit more about how the quarter played out? The reason I ask is core organic growth was flat. I think the Street was looking for 1%, so technically missed that. And I always assume there's some conservatism embedded. So I was just curious, like did September fall short for some reason? If so, why? I know you talked about the hurricane, but just any color on kind of how the quarter played out would be great. Marc Casper : Yes. So Jack, in terms of the growth, it was largely in line with what we expected to happen for the quarter. So from that perspective versus the external models, I always think there's a degree of accuracy between the Street and what we say we try to give as clear as we can on these calls about what our expectations are for the year and the upcoming quarter. And I think Stephen gave some very clear views again this quarter about the next one. So from our perspective, kind of, played out as we thought, in terms of the pacing through the quarter, largely as we expected, I would say, at the very, very end of the quarter, academic and government wasn't quite as strong as you normally would see. But like in the scale of our company, like a $10.5 billion-plus quarter, that's $10 million, $20 million. It's not a big number, but -- so I didn't really jump out any patterns of any significance in terms of how the month played out during the quarter. Jack Meehan : Got it. Okay, and then for Stephen, on guidance, you still have a $900 million range from the bottom top end. I know you're putting us to the midpoint here, but was there any consideration to narrowing it was the real level of variability in the business? Stephen Williamson : Yes, Jack. So for simplicity, we kept the range in our guidance from the last time around. And as you said, I encourage you to not overthink it. I'll just focus on the midpoint. That's the kind of current view where we most likely outcome for the quarter as we see it right now. And other than macro events, the largest swing factor for Q4 is likely to be the level of year-end spend by our customers. Marc Casper : Thanks, Jack. Jack Meehan : Thank you, Stephen. Stephen Williamson : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Doug Schenkel : Alright, thank you and good morning Marc and Stephen. As we sit here nine months, you know, about 10 months into the year with nine months of financials in the books, the portfolio seems to be tracking the plan. That said, there are always puts and takes on what's working better or worse than original target? As we sit here today, what geographies, customer groups, product categories, however you want to frame it, what's tracking ahead of expectation? What's below expectation? And as you think about the next few quarters, would you expect things to normalize back to what you were targeting at the beginning of the year? Or are there seemingly some more durable changes to how things are coming together? I ask not just to look back, but also just as kind of we're thinking about exit rates looking ahead to 2025. Marc Casper : So Doug, thanks for the question. So if we go back to January and we say -- we had a set of expectations for the year, and those expectations have really played out with an incredible degree of precision so far through the first nine months. First quarter on revenue was a little bit higher. The next two quarters were super tight around what we expected, and we're looking forward to the fourth quarter where we return to growth. And when you unpack the different businesses, there's actually not a lot there in terms of them also performing differently than what we expected. And I'll come back to that with a couple of added things. But -- so it was not like something is meaningfully different than what we thought in January, better or worse. The two things we did talk about, about what we could change the range for this year, was how would biotech perform in terms of funding and what would happen in China, right? And biotech is progressing in the right direction. Funding is improving, confidence is improving. As you know, there's a lag between funding and ultimately how that flows into our industry. So that's encouraging relative to what we saw certainly in the previous couple of years in that dimension. So that kind of helps you think a little bit about market conditions going forward. The second was China. China has not progressed, right? In terms of economic activity has been incredibly muted in terms of the environment. The government did announce two different types of stimulus programs, actually interesting. First, that affect our industry in a positive way, which is around the equipment stimulus and the loan program that they have for their customers or their institutions. And we expect that's largely a 2025 impact and beyond, so that's encouraging. And more recently, they actually announced stimulus programs to spur economic growth and business confidence and consumer confidence that actually would also be helpful for the long-term there. So that one is more on the come, right, because it hasn't -- the words have said, but in terms of the impact as to the economy, it hasn't seen. So that will be a swing factor going forward on how that plays out. And then it turns within our businesses, probably the only thing that I would really call out is it really is awesome to see the adoption of our high-end technologies and analytical insurance, right? It's just -- it's amazing how customers, even though it's obviously it\u2019s a muted environment in total, right? The industry is declining this year, and that's nothing of a surprise. That business is just getting great adoption for our technologies. And it was one of the cool things we said during the pandemic when we were just really driving great growth, because of our response, we reinvested in R&D, and that reinvestment has really led to differential performance in terms of how our technology has been adopted. So I'd call that out. Is that massively different than what we expected in January? No, but it's great to see, and it's a little bit better than what we expected. And the offsets to that are immaterial across the rest of the company. Doug Schenkel : Thanks for all that, Marc. I think my follow-up is probably a Stephen question, but obviously, welcome either of you as always to chime in. As I look at our model, I'm reminded that from 2022 to 2024, your core growth would have been about 0% down about 5%, and about flat again this year, year-by-year. So in a period where revenue growth has been challenging, you've actually maintained operating margin at similar levels for two years in a row, assuming you meet guidance this year. So as growth starts to improve slowly, but surely into next year. Is it fair to assume that there could be outsized margin improvement and incremental margin generation, essentially the benefit of strong operating discipline through a challenging period. I guess, I'm just wondering if margin expansion gets back into the LRP range before revenue cash? Stephen Williamson : Yes. So thanks for the question. So just to frame up how we think about the long-term financials. So for us, long-term 7% to 9% top line growth, which enables 40 basis points to 50 basis points of expansion. So that's kind of how we think about the future. And then you get down to the near-term and could it be slightly higher? I think I've said in the past that certain aspects of our business, where volumes have been more challenged and we've appropriately addressed the cost base, that there's some incremental benefit that can come from the return to volumes in those businesses. So there's an aspect of this that could be slightly higher and as we get into the next year and give guidance in January, we've got to frame up kind of how we think about the world, what's the level of the top line growth. And then what's an appropriate level of margin expansion, which is always a trade-off between making sure we get good profitability for our shareholders and then appropriately investing in the business as we think about going forward. So that kind of frames it up and look forward to getting to the details on the next call. Thanks, Doug. Doug Schenkel : All right, thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Tyko, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. Marc, wondering if you can just touch a little bit more on some of the drivers in LPS. You talked about, obviously, the channel, the safety and the market channel. But curious, we've heard more about share gains for Fisher. So I'm curious if you can kind of comment on that dynamic? And then you didn't call out PPD and Patheon within your comments specifically on that. I'm just wondering if they were actually up in the quarter. Marc Casper : You want to start, Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Yes, Tycho. So in my prepared remarks, I did talk about the dynamic where when you think about the underlying growth in both pharma services and clinical research, that offset the significant pandemic headwinds. So from an organic growth standpoint, that's kind of a net neutral. But when I think about what the underlying growth is there, it's strong. Marc, in terms of color... Marc Casper : No, the channel is doing really well. Actually, both the health care market channel and the research and safety market channel continue to do well. They're delivering nice growth and actually winning some really nice customers, which bodes well for the future. So part of the commentary that I talked about, customer wins and those things in my remarks, really a number of our businesses. But in those comments are really around large wins and channel clearly had some nice ones during the quarter, which doesn't show up at all in revenue in the quarter that you win them, but over the coming quarters ahead, it really is quite a positive. Tycho Peterson : Okay. And then I guess a follow-up just on the margins for the lab products and services. Obviously, you had the vaccine and therapy runoff. Is there anything you're willing to comment around price in this environment, the ability to potentially take more? Or are you getting more -- try to grab more CRO and CDMO work? And then how are you also thinking about capacity expansion for Patheon? Obviously, we saw Novo offload one of the Catalent facilities in Europe. I'm just curious how you're thinking about as more capacity comes to market, both from Novo and Catalent, but also Wuxi uptick, how interesting that might be for you. Marc Casper : You want to talk about price in aggregate\u2026 Stephen Williamson : Yes, price in aggregate for the company, we're just over 1% of price for the quarter. So still ahead of the kind of the normal run rate that we see as kind of 0.5% to 1% price on a net basis across the whole company. So a trend that's similar to what we've seen in the further first 3 quarters of the year, it's been consistent. Marc Casper : Yes, I'd say probably the pricing environment is back to normal. It's a good industry. Price goes up modestly each year. You have the dynamic inflation where price went up certainly more than what is usual and we're kind of back to the normal dynamic. In terms of our pharma services business, capacity expansions, as everyone knows, we've expanded our investments in sterile fill/finish capacity and have a number of lines that are coming online, if you will, during the course of 2025 and 2026 to support customer demand. So that's positive. That does put pressure on margins in the short term, because there's costs in training and getting the kind of the qualification process for the facilities. But certainly, as we get through 2025, you'll see higher levels of utilization on that capacity to support the strong growth in sterile fill/finish. And so that's the dynamic there. As I announced in my remarks, because of the specific capabilities of interest in oral solid dose, which is not our biggest part of our offering in drug products. We did do some capacity expansions in Bend, Oregon and Cincinnati, Ohio to meet the customer demand, which is good on the development side of the equation. So that's the dynamic there. Tycho Peterson : Okay, thank you. Marc Casper : Thanks, Tycho. Operator : Our next question is from Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Matt, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Matt Sykes : [Technical Difficulty] analytical Instrument segment, you've shown pretty consistent growth in what has been, I would call, a challenging environment. I know that Astral and microscopy have been big drivers of that. If you strip those two out and just look at the rest of your instrument categories, could you maybe talk about what demand looks like from them in those interesting categories from the biopharma side as well as other customers? And do you sense any kind of replacement cycle kicking in for some of those instruments as we move to '25? Just any thoughts on that would be great? Marc Casper : Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. So when I think about analytical instruments, we had 3% organic growth in the quarter playing out as we expected. Obviously, innovation really matters. For us, we've been able to launch a number of products that have been adopted. Actually on the high-end, we talk about Iliad in this particular quarter, that bodes well to continue to drive momentum in electron microscopy obviously, Astral has done very well as you noted. Stellar, which we launched last quarter, the early interest is quite strong. So those things are going well. Innuvion, which is non- chromatography more of a midrange technology, very important in that particular category of chromatography, incredibly strong demand. So our innovation has been well adopted. When you take out all of those things, you just kind of say the routine capital equipment aspects of instruments, actually pretty muted conditions, right? Nothing is surprising. When we talk about for the full-year for the whole company, to have market down in the low-single-digits, you would expect capital equipment to have you the conditions they are. And a big driver of that, obviously, is China, which is, in instrument businesses for the whole industry, is a large portion of demand and obviously that market is most challenged. So exactly where we are in the replacement cycle for those things, I think it really varies by customer, by product type and all of that. And we didn't see any particular pattern that jumped out to indicate any change in trajectory. Matt Sykes : Got it. Thanks. And then, Stephen, just a modeling question for you. Just the implied Q4 operating margin looks like over 100 basis point step-up to get to that full-year guide? I understand there's a return to growth expectation on the top line, some probably some gross margin leverage. Is there anything on the cost saving guides or mix that we should be aware of driving that step up in margins for the Q4? Stephen Williamson : Yes. So for Q4, the kind of the midpoint of that guide is a 50 basis points increase year-over-year for the quarter, and that's in line with when I think about the margin profile. It's really the step-up in the level of revenue and the kind of the seasonality to our revenue profile. So it logically makes sense and look at it sequentially in terms of the change. Matt Sykes : Okay, thank you. Stephen Williamson : Great. Thanks, Matt. Rafael Tejada : Operator, we will take one more question. Operator : Our next question is from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Dan, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks. Thanks for the questions. Great. Maybe, Marc, just on pharma R&D, headlines have been mixed, but we just looked at like a global analysis of R&D trends. And then actually they look pretty good for large pharma, up nearly 8%, and kind of global pharma, up like mid-5s? So I'm just wondering, like trying to square the circle with kind of the weaker end market growth that you're kind of base your guide on and maybe why we're not seeing what appears to be a decent level of R&D growth, you're not translating into better revenues. Like has anything changed? Maybe is there more dollars going to service? Inflation? Or just in terms of the traditional amount of dollars that your business would see from R&D, is anything kind of different this time? Stephen Williamson : Yes. I think one element is significant investment by our customers in AI. Unfortunately not on medical instruments. But when I think about generative AI and where the spending on technology, there's a significant piece to that, what you need to factor that in the guide. Marc Casper : Yes. So Dan, probably when we think about pharma and biotech, right, it covers the full spectrum of activity. And one of the things that's within that is on production, you have the headwinds across the industry of bioproduction, right? So there's not like an R&D specific call out that you can derive from the numbers. We all understand the runoff on the pandemic is largely in the clinical research side and largely in the bioproduction and pharma services side. So that's a little bit of what's muting the growth in total for our industry. In terms of the dialogue that I've had with customers and sort of what's the tone? People are super excited about the pipeline, right? Whether it's the fact of the GLP-1s and the scale of a high-impact medicine that it just really is getting people excited. But there's really interesting work going on, on Alzheimer's, which is fantastic. And you've seen some interesting approvals in other neurological diseases that there's just a lot of excitement about pipelines and opportunities. And so I believe that the data you're quoting about the R&D investment is looking good, it reflects that customers have optimism for the future. And ultimately, that's going to translate into our space. So which is why we're so confident about the long-term prospects for our industry. Dan Brennan : Great. Thanks for that. And then maybe just one follow-up on China. A few peers have discussed that they're seeing a pause in instrument spending ahead of the stimulus next year. I think you mentioned in a prior question, how like China instrument demand is kind of a weaker spot. Any color there? And as the stimulus comes through, is this going to be a meaningful lift for you guys in '25? Or do you think it will be more modest? Thanks a lot. Marc Casper : Dan, thanks. So when I think about China and I think about stimulus, certainly a discussion I had when I was meeting with government officials and certainly with customers as well, really, activity has been around applying for the funding, right, and going through that process. So there's quite a bit of that activity. So I'm not sure that trade is something else off, but it might have. Like I don't know, like, none of the customers specifically mentioned it, but I didn't ask the question that way. I was much more interested about how are they tapping into the available new funds and how are they thinking about it, and there seems to be optimism and enthusiasm for the upcoming investments. So I think stimulus will be a 2025 activity, maybe a little bit in Q4, probably not all that significant, but -- so that's how I think about what's going on in China. The other thing from the China trip that I came away with -- and obviously, I knew it going in, but we are incredibly well positioned in the country. I mean we have deep relationships with our customers, very strong earned relationships with government. Being a scale player for 40-years in the country and supporting their response to the pandemic, various crises in the past, just a good local participant to help society out there, we benefit from that. And we're well positioned to help our customers, and we have great discussions about customer dialogue with where can we collaborate, and how can we help them, have the Chinese population be healthier through our technology business. So I think as the economy improves there, we're going to be well positioned to capitalize on that. So thank you for the questions today. Let me just make a quick closing comment. And it's good to have another strong quarter behind us. And we're very well positioned to deliver differentiated performance into 2024 as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders and to build an even brighter future for our company. We look forward to updating you on our fourth quarter and full year performance in our January call. And as always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you very much, everyone, for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

So, with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc. Marc Casper : Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered an excellent finish to 2024 with strong revenue and earnings growth. Our fourth quarter results continue to highlight the strength of our operational and commercial execution. As I reflect on our performance for the full year, I'm very proud of our team as they continue to enable the success of our customers. This resulted in meaningful market share gains and strengthening our trusted partner status with our customers. We are incredibly well positioned for the future. I'll get into more detail later in my remarks, but first, let me recap the financials. Starting with the quarter. Our revenue in Q4 grew 5% year-over-year to $11.4 billion. Our adjusted operating income grew 7% to $2.72 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margins by 50 basis points to 23.9%. And we delivered strong adjusted EPS performance, growing adjusted EPS 8% to $6.10 per share in the quarter. Then in terms of our full year results, our revenue was $42.9 billion in 2024. Adjusted operating income was $9.71 billion, and adjusted EPS was $21.86 per share. Turning to our performance by end-market. In the fourth quarter, underlying market conditions played out as we expected and continued to improve. Our team's excellent execution resulted in revenue performance that was ahead of our expectations, and we delivered positive revenue growth across all of our end markets. Let me provide you with some additional context. Starting with pharma and biotech, we grew in the mid-single digits in Q4. This marks the fourth quarter in a row of sequential improvement for this customer segment. Performance in the quarter was led by our research and safety market channel, pharma services and bioproduction businesses. For the full year, pharma and biotech declined in the low single digits, which included a mid-single-digit headwind from the runoff of vaccine and therapy related revenue. In academic and government, we grew in the high-single digits during the quarter and in the low-single digits for the full year. In the quarter, we delivered strong growth in chromatography and mass spectrometry and our research and safety market channel. In industrial and applied, we grew in the high-single digits during the quarter and low-single digits for the full year. Growth in the quarter was highlighted by strong performance in our electron microscopy business and in our research and safety market channel. Finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, we grew in the low single-digits during the quarter and declined low-single digits for the full year. As a reminder, the reported growth in this end-market was impacted by the runoff of COVID-19 testing-related revenue. During the quarter and the full year, the team delivered good core revenue growth, highlighted by our transplant diagnostics, immunodiagnostics and our healthcare market channel. Thanks to our proven growth strategy and our team's excellent execution, we delivered a strong finish across all of our end markets, continuing to drive meaningful share gain. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars : high-impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers and our unparalleled commercial engine. As you know, our growth strategy really resonates with our customers. And throughout the year, we have continuously strengthened our company to be even more relevant for the future. Let me give you some highlights. Starting with the first pillar, we had another really terrific year of high-impact innovation. Throughout 2024, we launched outstanding products across our businesses that strengthen our industry leadership by enabling our customers to advance their important work. In chromatography and mass spectrometry this year, it was highlighted by the launch of our Thermo Scientific Stellar mass spectrometer, which complements our award-winning Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral launched in 2023 by validating biomarker candidates of interest to advance clinical research. It's been great to see the significant impact these two mass spectrometers are having on advancing science. We also launched the Thermo Scientific Dionex Inuvion ion chromatography system, which streamlines environmental testing in industrial and applied settings, helping our customers identify contaminants more efficiently. In electron microscopy, we launched the Thermo Scientific Iliad scanning from transmission electron microscope, which integrates a number of advanced analytical technologies into a seamless and user-friendly workflow to enable the development of advanced materials. In our biosciences business, we launched the Applied Biosystems MagMAX sequential DNA, RNA kit, which maximizes the isolation of DNA and RNA from blood cancer samples, helping researchers identify unique insights into cancer-causing genetic alterations. And in bioproduction, we launched the first-of-its-kind bio-based film for our single-use technologies, developed with plant-based material rather than fossil fuel materials, this innovative film provides lower carbon solutions for the production of biologics. We continued this great innovation momentum in the fourth quarter. In chromatography and mass spectrometry, we launched the Thermo Scientific iCAP MX Series ICP-MS, an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry platform designed to streamline Trace Elemental analysis for environmental, food, industrial and research laboratories. And in Life Science Solutions, we introduced new additions to the Gibco CTS Detachable Dynabeads platform to further enhance the development and manufacturing of life-changing cell therapies. So another year of innovation that was spectacular, and we have an exciting pipeline for the future as well. In 2024, we also continued to strengthen our industry-leading commercial engine and deepen our trusted partner status with customers to accelerate their innovation and enhance their productivity. Throughout the year, we expanded our capabilities to meet our current -- our customers' current and future needs. This included expanding our pharma services and clinical research capabilities in the US and Europe. To be an even stronger partner for our pharma and biotech customers, in the fourth quarter, we introduced our Accelerator Drug Development solution. This truly unique offering leverages our combined CDMO and CRO capabilities to enable our customers to move their critical drug development programs forward with speed, quality and efficiency, helping to improve their return on their R&D investments. This is a huge value-add for our customers and not something they can do alone or with our competitors. Customer feedback has been incredibly positive. We're winning new business, and we're excited about the future impact of our Accelerated Drug Development capabilities. We also made significant advancements in partnerships and collaborations with our customers throughout the year. This included our partnership with the National Cancer Institute on the myeloMATCH precision medicine umbrella trial, which we announced in July. And then the FDA approval for our Ion Torrent Oncomine Dx Target Test, that's another example of our customer partnerships. This is a next-generation sequencing-based assay to be used as a companion diagnostic for serving as first treatment for patients living with glioma, a type of brain cancer. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we entered into a partnership with the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences to establish a Thermo Fisher Scientific Center of Excellence for Proteomics there. These partnerships demonstrate how close we are working with our customers to enable their success and drive meaningful impact for patients. So as you can see, it was another excellent year of advancing our growth strategy. As always, our PPI Business System continued to enable outstanding execution throughout the year. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day. PPI is helping us to drive share gain and improve quality, productivity and customer allegiance. We're also benefiting from the application of generative AI into our PPI Business System. Our colleagues around the world are actively deploying Gen AI, finding new ways to improve the customer experience, streamline internal processes and enhance our products and services. So not only do PPI contribute to our excellent financial results, it's also helping our team to find new ways to enable our customer success, ensuring a very bright future for our company. Turning to capital deployment. We continue to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy to create tremendous value. We do this through a combination of strategic M&A and substantial return of capital to our shareholders. In 2024, we returned $4.6 billion of capital to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends, including repurchasing $1 billion of shares in the fourth quarter. In terms of M&A, during the year, we completed our acquisition of Olink, a leading provider of advanced solutions for proteomics research. Olink is now our Proteomic Science business. The integration is progressing smoothly. And just after quarter-end, our Olink technology was selected by the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project to support the world's largest human proteomic study of its kind, the latest validation of the value of our capabilities. When I think about our disciplined approach to M&A and our unparalleled track record, it's all about long-term value creation for our shareholders. We just celebrated the two-year anniversary of the acquisition of the Binding Site, now our Protein Diagnostics business. This business performed incredibly well again in 2024, delivering low teens growth launching new products and driving a great return on investment. This is a recent example of the impact of our proven capital deployment strategy in action. Let me now give you a brief update on our corporate social responsibility initiatives. As a mission-driven company, we help to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also have a positive impact by supporting our communities and being a good steward of our planet, and are proud of the actions we took in 2024 in this regard. We made meaningful progress on our Net Zero road map by reducing our emissions, increasing the number of our Zero Waste Certified sites and launching new greener products and shipping solutions. We also formed new collaborations to improve health outcomes across the globe, and we were named one of the world's most innovative companies by Fast Company for our significant contributions in diagnostics that help to advance health equity. Additionally, we continue to advance our STEM education programs, reaching more than 180,000 students globally. This helps to ensure we have students engaged in the sciences as, ultimately, they'll become our future customers. As I reflect on the year, I'm very proud of what our team accomplished. We have more than 120,000 passionate colleagues who are dedicated to enabling our customer success and advancing science. Together, we continue to build a bright future for our company, and I'm very excited about the year ahead. So let me now turn to guidance. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into the guidance, but let me quickly cover the highlights. In 2025, we will once again deliver strong share gain, and our PPI Business System will enable outstanding execution and we will deliver very strong earnings growth. We're initiating a 2025 revenue guidance in the range of $43.5 billion to $44 billion, which assumes 3% to 4% organic growth. And an adjusted EPS guidance range of $23.10 to $23.50, which represents 6% to 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share. We're in a great position as we enter 2025. I'm incredibly excited by the opportunities we have with our customers and to create value for all of our stakeholders and build an even brighter future for our company. So to summarize our key takeaways for 2024. Our proven growth strategy continued to drive significant share gain. We continued to elevate our trusted partner status and deepen the relationships with many customers. And this, in combination with the power of our PPI Business System, enabled us to deliver an excellent finish to 2024 with differentiated performance for the quarter and the full year. As we enter 2025 with strong momentum, we are well positioned to deliver excellent financial performance and further strengthen our long-term competitive position. With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, we had an excellent Q4. The team executed well in the quarter and we delivered Q4 financials significantly ahead of what was assumed in the midpoint of our prior guide. We beat Q4 organic growth by just under 2 points, adjusted EPS by $0.14, and we ended the year with very strong free cash flow, delivering $7.3 billion for the year. Looking back on 2024, we had a very successful year. The markets played out as we outlined at the beginning of the year, with growth steadily improving each quarter. Our proven growth strategy drove consistent share gain and the PPI Business System enabled great execution. All of this enabled us to consistently deliver differentiated financial performance throughout the year, all whilst further strengthening our industry leadership. This puts us in a great position to deliver an excellent 2025. Let me now provide you with some additional details on our Q4 and full year 2024 performance. Starting with earnings per share. In the quarter, adjusted EPS grew 8% to $6.10. For the full year, we delivered adjusted EPS of $21.86. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.78 and, for the full year, it was $16.53. On the top line, Q4 reported revenue grew 5% year-over-year. The components of our reported revenue change included 4% organic growth, a 1% contribution from acquisitions and a slight headwind from foreign exchange. In Q4, core organic revenue increased 5%. For the full year 2024, reported organic and core organic revenue were all flat year-over-year. In 2024, we delivered $520 million of pandemic-related revenue comprised of approximately $100 million of testing and $420 million from vaccines and therapies. Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography. In Q4, North America grew mid-single digits, Europe grew low single digits, and Asia Pacific grew high single digits, with China growing mid-single digits. For the full year, North America declined low single digits, Europe was flat year-over-year, and Asia Pacific and China within Asia Pacific grew low single digits. With respect to our operational performance, we delivered $2.72 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, an increase of 7% year-over-year, and adjusted operating margin was 23.9%, 50 basis points higher than Q4 last year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, reflecting the continued execution of our cost management initiatives, and we drove good volume pull-through. This enabled us to fund strategic investments to further advance our industry leadership and offset the expected impact of unfavorable mix this quarter. For the full year, we delivered $9.71 billion of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin was 22.6%. Total company gross margin in the quarter was 43.2%, 170 basis points higher than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 42.2%, an increase of 100 basis points versus 2023. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 16.1% of revenue. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 16.3% of revenue. Total R&D expense was $374 million in Q4. For the full year, R&D expense was $1.39 billion, up 4% year-over-year, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue for the full year was 7.2%. Looking at our results below the line. Our Q4 net interest expense was $89 million, slightly higher than Q4 2023. Net interest expense for the full year was $312 million, a decrease of $183 million year-over-year, driven by effective management of our debt portfolio and our strong cash flow. The adjusted tax rate was 10.9% in Q4 and 10.5% for the full year, in line with our expectations. Average diluted shares were 383 million in Q4, 5 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution. In Q4, we repurchased $1 billion of shares, bringing our total repurchases for 2024 to $4 billion. Turning to free cash flow and the balance sheet. Full year cash flow from operations was $8.7 billion and free cash flow was $7.3 billion, after investing $1.3 billion of net capital expenditures. During 2024, we deployed $7.7 billion of capital, $3.1 billion through M&A with the acquisition of Olink and $4.6 billion through the return of capital to shareholders in the form of $4 billion of buybacks and approximately $600 million of dividends. We ended the quarter with $5.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and $31.3 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.9 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.4 times on a net debt basis. In concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 11.6%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q4 reported revenue in this segment grew 5% and organic revenue growth was 3%. Growth in this segment was driven by our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. For the full year, reported revenue declined 3% and organic revenue was 4% lower versus 2023. Q4 adjusted operating income for Life Sciences Solutions increased 6%, and adjusted operating margin was 36.6%, up 40 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During Q4, we delivered strong productivity and good volume pull-through, which was partially offset by unfavorable mix and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 2%, and adjusted operating margin was 36.4%, an increase of 210 basis points versus 2023. In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue grew 7% and organic revenue growth was 8%. The strong growth in the quarter was led by electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. For the full year, both reported revenue and organic revenue grew 3%. In this segment, Q4 adjusted operating income increased 13% and adjusted operating margin was 30.5%, up 170 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity and good volume pull-through and had favorable FX. This was partially offset by unfavorable mix and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 2% and adjusted operating margin was 26.2%, 10 basis points lower than 2023. Turning to Specialty Diagnostics, in Q4, both reported revenue and organic revenue grew 5%. In Q4, growth in this segment was led by transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses as well as our healthcare market channel. For the full year, reported revenue increased 2% and organic revenue growth was 3%. Q4 adjusted operating income for Specialty Diagnostics increased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 23.6%, 30 basis points lower than Q4 2023. During the quarter, we delivered good productivity, which is more than offset by strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income was 3% higher than 2023 and adjusted operating margin was 25.7%, an increase of 20 basis points versus the prior year. And finally, in Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, both reported revenue and organic revenue grew 4% versus the prior year quarter. The runoff of vaccines and therapies revenue had a mid-single-digit impact on the growth in this segment in Q4. This was offset by very good growth in our pharma services business and research and safety market channel. For the full year, reported revenue grew 1% and organic revenue was flat. In this segment, Q4 adjusted operating income increased 3%, and adjusted operating margin was 14%, which is flat to Q4 2023. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is offset by strategic investments and unfavorable mix. For the full year, adjusted operating income declined 8% and adjusted operating margin was 13.3%, which is 130 basis points lower versus 2023. Turning now to guidance. As Marc outlined, we're initiating a 2025 revenue guidance range of $43.5 billion to $44 billion, and an adjusted EPS guidance range of $23.10 to $23.50. This guidance assumes 3% to 4% organic revenue growth on 1% headwind from the remaining runoff of the pandemic-related revenue and a 1.5% revenue headwind from foreign exchange and approximately 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. All of this will enable a really strong 6% to 8% growth in adjusted EPS. The strength of the guidance reflects our industry-leading position, our proven growth strategy and the power of our PPI Business System. Let me now provide some more detailed context behind the guide, starting with the market growth framing. In 2024, we estimate the industry market growth was down low single digits. In 2025, we expect the market growth will be better than 2024. We expect market growth will be slightly positive for the year, improving as the year progresses. With this market context and a very strong share gain, we expect organic growth for 2025 to be in the range of 3% to 4%. Now as I commented earlier, this includes a 1% headwind from the remainder of the pandemic runoff, largely in our clinical research business. So the underlying total company growth is strong. Turning to FX. Given recent changes in rates, we're assuming there will be a headwind from revenue from FX in 2025 of approximately $650 million or 1.5 points. Putting all this together, our top line guidance assumes a 1.5% to 2.5% increase in reported revenue dollars and a 3% to 4% increase in organic revenue. This is a strong step-up from 2024. Moving on to the bottom line. We expect to deliver a very strong year of adjusted EPS growth in 2025. The cost actions we took over the past couple of years are enabling very accretive pull-through on the incremental dollars of revenue growth, and we will continue to use the PPI Business System to drive productivity and actively manage our cost base. This will enable very strong adjusted operating margin expansion of approximately 90 basis points. Below the line, we're effectively managing our debt and cash positions and taking advantage of great interest rates from cash deposits. And all of this will enable us to deliver adjusted EPS in the range of $23.10 and $23.50, which is a very strong 6% to 8% growth for the year. In terms of potential changes in the macro environment, our guidance is assumed to cover the impact of modest policy changes. And then to help you with your modeling, here are a few additional assumptions behind the guide. We expect approximately $350 million of net interest expense in 2025. We assume that the adjusted income tax rate will be 11.5% in 2025, largely driven by the increased earnings. We're expecting between $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion of net capital expenditures in 2025. And we're assuming free cash flow is in the range of $7 billion to $7.4 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, we're assuming $2 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. And we estimate the full year average diluted share count will be between 378 million and 379 million shares. And we're assuming to return approximately $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends. And finally, I wanted to touch on phasing for Q1. Embedded in the guidance for the year is an assumption that organic growth is flat in Q1, as is adjusted EPS growth in Q1. This is largely driven by Q1 having two less selling days than the prior year quarter and also phasing of our services revenue within the year. So in conclusion, Q4 capped off a very successful 2024. We expect to continue to manage the company and the opportunities really well in 2025 and a focus on delivering very strong share gains and adjusted EPS growth enabling excellent financial performance. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Rafael Tejada : Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you very much. We will now open the floor for the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Michael Ryskin : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to start with something that you flagged briefly there in your closing remarks, Stephen. I think you mentioned modest policy changes built into the guide. I just -- I'm wondering if you could expand on that and just broadly talk about guidance methodology going into 2025. It feels like there's a lot more uncertainty even despite where we're coming from the last couple of years, specifically as it relates to policy and government changes, things like tariffs, NIH, export controls announced a couple of weeks ago on some specific product lines. It's still really tough and too early to say how these will play out. So I'm just wondering if you -- how much conservatism you built into the guide, just what are your assumptions on some of these factors? Any additional color you could provide there would be helpful. Marc Casper : So Mike, thanks for the question. Maybe I'll start with a summary actually of kind of the key points, and then I'll talk a little bit about the -- what's going on from a policy perspective, what we embedded in the guide. So bear with me a little bit. So when I think about 2024, I think the key points are the team executed very well, right? And the performance was quite differentiated financially and really great momentum with our customers. Ultimately, the trusted partner status continues to strengthen and positions the company for a bright future. Fourth quarter was strong, right? 4% organic growth, 8% growth in EPS, adjusted EPS. Market conditions, they improved sequentially throughout the year as we expected. We saw positive growth with our expectation for the market in the fourth quarter and which is what we thought at the beginning of last year. So the predictability is back in our industry, which is great. When I think about 2025, what we're assuming in the guidance is that the market conditions will continue to strengthen as the year progresses. And we're entering the year with good momentum, right? So our focus, especially given that there's always some level of uncertainty or volatility, is to really deliver outstanding EPS growth this year, right? And what we embedded in our guidance is 6% to 8% adjusted EPS growth. And our best view of the market returning positive organically in terms of total and us delivering 3% to 4%. So that's how we thought about it, and we're actively managing the business. So we're very excited about what's the year ahead. Now when I think about policy changes, what's embedded, I think you know deeply our philosophy. Within reason of changes or within reasons of opportunities, we just manage through it. It becomes -- it's our job to manage through the unanticipated changes, unless there is such a magnitude, on the good side or the bad, that we would articulate it, right? So we thought about the environment where, today, there's a lot of ideas being discussed but not really yet materialized into any particular policies. What I'm very excited about is the business environment, particularly in the US, is going to be much more business-friendly with much more of a focus on economic growth. I'm excited that the -- from an M&A perspective, we're likely to see a much more reasonable environment from a regulatory perspective. And when I think about what our company does and what our customers do, science and medicine are unbelievably important, and they're not discretionary. And therefore, we're excited about it, and we'll navigate whatever the environment holds. Michael Ryskin : Okay. That's helpful, Marc. Thank you. And then for a quick follow-up. In terms of the EPS guide, you're right, better earnings power than we had anticipated, I think most had anticipated. Stephen, I think you said 90 basis points operating margin expansion. That's very strong, especially given the subdued top line environment. So if you could expand on that. And you mentioned some of the cost actions you've taken in the past. But are there incremental cost actions throughout 2025? Sort of what's the contribution from return to volume growth or maybe mix shift? Just any color on that 90 basis points. Thanks. Stephen Williamson : Yes. So Mike, yes, that's the right number. And yes, so really good volume pull-through. So when I think about the cost actions we've taken over the past couple of years as we've kind of wound down from the impact of pandemic, and certain areas of our business have had lower volumes than normal, like they're coming back to more normal volumes and we're making sure that the incremental revenue is pulling through at a really high clip. So great to see that, and that's embedded in the numbers. And then it's not just kind of huge cost initiatives, it's about just managing our P&L appropriately and using the PPI Business System to be able to do that. So driving very strong productivity and good cost management in the top line environment that we're in for the year. So bring that all together, that's what's driving the 90 basis points. Michael Ryskin : Thanks, Mike. Stephen Williamson : Thank you so much. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Rachel, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Rachel Vatnsdal : Perfect. Good morning and thank you so much for taking the question. So I wanted to follow up on your answer to Mike's first question around some of the policy changes that we've seen, but specifically to NIH funding. Obviously, we've seen some of the reports the last few weeks around federal funding potentially getting frozen in light of the new administration. So I appreciate that it's early days and we don't know what some of these policies could ultimately look like. But at the same time, you would have to imagine that some of these headlines are driving disruption at your customers. So can you walk us through what have you seen since the new administration turnover in terms of customers' behavior, especially within that academic and government market? And how are you actually expecting NIH funding to play out this year? Marc Casper : Yes. So Rachel, it's been nine days, so in terms of the environment. So I don't think there's any real insight into what's going on. And obviously, there's actually no policies yet, right? There are different things being explored. And our job is to work collaboratively with the administration, and we have a good working relationship certainly with the President's first administration and educate on the importance of our industry and our customers' work, and help our customers navigate the environment as well. So from my perspective, look at will help our customers navigate whatever it is. When I think about what's embedded in our guidance, I would say for academic and government globally, would be around the company average in terms of what's assumed there, and maybe slightly below that because I think pharma and biotech ultimately will be a little bit better than the company average this year in terms of the end-markets. And when you think about that, about half of our academic and government end-market is in the US and half is in markets around the world. Interestingly enough, we obviously had an incredibly strong finish in academic and government in the fourth quarter. And it was globally strong, right? It was really every market had really a very strong end to the year. So hopefully, that's helpful. Rachel Vatnsdal : Yes, that is. Thanks for framing that up. To follow up then, I just wanted to ask on Analytical Instrumentation. Obviously, that was a really nice quarter in 4Q. So can you walk us through some of the drivers of that beat? Did you guys see any budget flush trends in the quarter? And was there any benefit from China stimulus in that number? And then when you look at Analytical Instrumentation performance for 2025, what are your assumptions regarding China stimulus contribution? Thank you. Marc Casper : Yes. So Rachel, thanks. Our instrument business once again had a really very positive year, capped off with 8% organic growth in the fourth quarter, 3% growth for the full year. And that's an environment where China was relatively muted for the full year. And as you know, China is a meaningful contributor to the instruments business across the industry. So the team really doing a great job. So what drives that? It's the steady drumbeat of innovation. That makes a huge difference. And if you think about even in my remarks, I had to really narrow it down, right, in terms of the number of products we launched. And you see on instrument after another, you see many other regions and other products. But we are just on a roll in terms of phenomenal new products, right, whether it's in whether it's in electron microscopy, whether it's in chromatography and mass spectrometry. And also in the environmental type applications with ion chromatography, with ICP-MS. Just really strong and the adoption is great. And that's driving meaningful share gain. And the way that our business works is you have relevant innovation customers because of the importance of the work they're doing, they find the funding, and that's how it showed up. In terms of stimulus in China and how we thought about it, it was actually nice to see revenue. It wasn't huge, but it was nice to see revenue flow in the instruments business in the fourth quarter. Orders were actually stronger in terms of the orders that we received in China on our instruments, and that will obviously ship in 2025. So stimulus started to flow there as well. So hopefully, that gives you a good sense of the momentum in our instruments business. Operator : Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Jack, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan : Thank you and good morning. So Stephen, you talked about the phasing of\u2026 Stephen Williamson : Good morning. Jack Meehan : Good morning. I forget if it was Stephen or Marc, you talked about the phasing of services revenue during the year. So I'll bite, what does the guide assume for PPD clinical research? And can you give us an update, just color on what you're seeing in terms of new authorizations? Stephen Williamson : Yes. So I'll give the kind of the phasing aspect and Marc will give you some more detail about the businesses, so which are both in the great shape, by the way. So when I think about phasing within the year, I said that in Q1, there's some timing in the phasing there. It's largely the pandemic-related runoff is more pronounced in Q1, given comps from last year. So that's the largest piece of the phasing. There's a little bit of phasing quarter-to-quarter in terms of the overall phasing for our pharma services business, but that's kind of a normal noise. But that's probably the largest driver that I talked about in Q1. Marc Casper : Yes. So Jack, when I think about the clinical research capabilities that we have, we're a leader and incredible reputation for innovation and quality and performance for our customers. And when you think about that, one of the things that we've been talking a little bit about, I'll try to highlight it more today, was the combination with our pharma services business. And as you know, in pharma services, we're a leading provider of contract development and manufacturing capabilities. We spent over three years looking at the added value of having those both sets of capabilities, the insights you get and the impact that you can have for the customers. And when we launched Accelerator Drug Development, it really is compelling. And what that really is allowing our customers to do is to leverage our expertise and capabilities to improve the returns on investment of their R&D investments, which is everything in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. So we're excited. When I think about more of the details and I think about clinical research, we delivered low single-digit organic growth last year, right? The team did a good job, a really good job. And that was to basically grow the business despite the very meaningful headwind from the runoff of vaccines and therapies that was in that business. And when I think to the future about 2025, the business is behaving the way that I would think it should, which it's a long cycle business. So you saw for the industry, even with us in low single-digit growth last year, that's below the trend line. The trend line for this business is a high single-digit growth business. It's the result of 2023's biotech environment and 2023 and 2024's pharmaceutical customers actually reprioritizing their portfolios for the IRA. When I look at authorizations, particularly in the back half of 2024, they were very strong for us. And when I look at the commercial pipeline that we have this year and the conversations that our executive team is having with our customers the business actually has a lot of momentum underlying. And if I think about sort of the cycle time of the business, that bodes well towards the end of the year and then during 2026. It feels like the conditions will be more measured this year. That's what's embedded in our guidance, kind of similar to what we saw last year, and then it sets up for great success. So overall, super positive. Jack Meehan : Awesome. And you're leading me exactly where I want to go next, which is the guide for 2026. Mostly joking, but can you just talk about as you look at the phases of the guide in 2025, what does the exit rate look like in the fourth quarter? And just more broadly, just like confidence about your ability to get back to the LRP targets that you have? Stephen Williamson : Yes, Jack, I'd be thrilled to talk about 2026 on this call, in a year's time. But I understand that you think about that in how you're thinking about the trajectory of the company. Yes, first of all, we're highly confident we're going to get back to the industry long-term market growth rate of 4% to 6%. It's just a matter of what the timing you actually get to that point. And we've proven the ability to consistently drive share gain above that, so our organic growth will be stronger than markets. And it's great the markets are improving. When I think about what the guide setup this year going from market down a couple of points to being up slightly, that's a continued improvement. And the trajectory we expect that, as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect that to continue to increase as we go through the year. The exact ending point of where market growth will be at the end of the year, we'll see that as we get close towards the end of the year. And as Marc said at the beginning, our job in this period is going through that transition back to normal is to drive really strong adjusted EPS growth. And that's exactly what we're setting out to do here for the year ahead. Jack Meehan : Awesome. Thanks, Stephen. Stephen Williamson : Thanks, Jack. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Doug, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Marc Casper : Doug, you're on mute. Doug Schenkel : Good morning, guys. Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of questions on guidance. So the first is on the top line. And I'm just sitting here playing with the model, thinking through the stacks, thinking through the comps, thinking about what you talked about for the first quarter starting rate. That leads me to a question of are you expecting to exit 2025 back in your targeted 7% to 9% organic growth range? I can see where you're at least close to the low end of that. So that's my first question. My second is back to the topic of the 90 basis points of targeted operating margin expansion that is embedded in your guidance. This would be particularly impressive in any period. It's especially notable right now given your revenue growth rate for the year is below your long-term construct. And there has been speculation that you wouldn't be able to get anywhere close to that type of margin expansion with the lower level of growth. So obviously, you expect to do that. So the questions are : one, what's allowing you to do this in 2025? Is this a function of mix? Is it a function of basically the benefit of operating really tightly in a tough environment and starting to come out of it? Is it something else? And then I guess the other part of that is, are there reasons we shouldn't assume a continuation of this type of margin potential as we think about future years where you are getting back into your normalized growth construct? Thank you. Marc Casper : So thanks for the question. So let me start with context, right? So if I think about the many interactions that I have with investors over many years, but certainly over, let's say, the last six, nine months, a lot of the of the investors have been focused on, and certainly the analyst community as well, what's the momentary change in the trajectory growth rate of the industry, right? And we understand why, because it's an amazing industry with an incredible future and we're in a recovering environment. And one of the things as a management team, as you know, we're very focused on great performance and great execution, is what's going to be most helpful to our shareholders in creating value and creating a bright future. And we're in a recovering market and we're expecting a better year in terms of market environment, better year in organic growth this year. But the thing that we can control is how great is our earnings per share, and that's through the power of our PPI Business System, strong execution, cost discipline. It's not a mix driver or any of those things. As a leadership team, what we're focused on is delivering another very differentiated year and fully focused on the thing that we can control, which is how we drive our revenue down to the bottom line. So it's not the long-term new number, right, but it's the right number for 2025. I think the 40 to 50 basis points of long-term expansion associated with 7% to 9% is an appropriate driver. But this year, that's the way I would think about it. In terms of the 3% to 4%, one thing that we all should just remind ourselves, there's a point of headwind in that number for the final runoff of the pandemic. So our assumption is effectively zero pandemic revenue related this year -- revenue this year. So you can say the normalized growth is getting back to stronger growth, but it's not yet at 7% to 9%, right? You can do the phasing if you're assuming, as Stephen has laid out, a flat start to the year, and we understand that's clearly why. It's not about a market thing, it's kind of the phasing of days and how we see the service revenue specifically laying out. You're going to wind up with something in the strong mid-single digits at the end of the year for us, right? And you can say, well, there's a point of headwind, so you're not quite at the 7% to 9% but you're progressing in a direction that would be encouraging. And we're excited for this year, like this is a big step-up in expectations, and we're going to deliver it versus last year. And the quarter-after-quarter of just better market conditions sets us up for an incredible future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Tycho, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson : Hey, thanks. Marc, I want to cover a little more on the accelerator program and really just trying to understand why now is the right time. Synergies for PPD have gone well. So any kind of bogey you can point to in the next couple of years in terms of how you're thinking about synergies? Is this more for small or large customers, more on the CDMO side or CRO side? And has this brought to light any additional kind of service offerings that you might need to bring to these customers? Marc Casper : So Tycho, thanks for the question. One thing that I've learned and is held deeply ingrained with our customer base, is you don't make promises that you don't have a 100% confidence that you are going to be able to deliver. That's what our customers expect of us. So if you remember back to the announcement of the acquisition of PPD, we talked about the potential to bend the time and cost curve of developing medicines. That was a strategy that we articulated. And then you haven't heard us talk about it really at all for the last three years. Not because we weren't working on it, but because we wouldn't declare that opportunity until we had the proof cases in place, customers actually leveraging the combined capabilities of the company and the confidence that we can have great conversations with our customers to continue to deliver great results for them. The authorizations momentum is very strong in terms of how our customers perceive our capabilities and performance. And customers can pick and choose, right? It's not that they have to buy everything, but rather they can pick the relevant the relevant insights from us and expertise to shave the weeks and months off of the time lines, to be more cost effective and leverage our expertise. And the excitement is very substantial. When I think about -- we're seeing interest and excitement and authorizations and orders, orders being on the pharma services language, what we're seeing is it's faster in biotech because you have a decision-maker that sort of has the whole domain, but we're seeing great interest in large pharma as well. And with large pharma, you typically will pick a molecule, a part of their pipeline and work that way. And biotech, it typically will work across everything they're doing. So it's exciting times, and we're just getting going. So as you know, these are long-cycle businesses. So it takes some time to actually translate the authorizations and orders into revenue, but it bodes really well for the acceleration of growth, certainly in 2026 and beyond. Tycho Peterson : Great. And then follow-up on China. I didn't actually hear what you're assuming for China growth this year. Assuming your products come off the trade restrictions list, I think last time you were able to get them off, and then I know you don't have as much exposure to volume-based procurement, but how you're thinking about exposure there? And obviously, the headwinds have magnified. Marc Casper : Yes. So in terms of China, when I think about the year, first of all, 2024, and that's a reasonable framing for the next year, we really had a very a very strong year in very, challenged environment, right? The economy is challenging, the end-market is challenged. Our business in the fourth quarter grew mid-single digits. We grew low single digits for the full year, and clearly gaining market share. So the team has done a good job. Our expectation is that the environment is similar to what we saw last year. Stimulus will be a benefit. And they'll be -- just we're not assuming any recovery from an economic perspective. And that may change, that may be a bad assumption, but we don't see any evidence yet of a real strengthening environment other than stimulus. So we just assume that the conditions will continue to be somewhat muted and similar to last year. In terms of healthcare on value-based procurement and some of the reimbursement things that have been executed, your framing is exactly right, which is very small for us. And because our diagnostic business in China is very much in the specialty area, it's not a large business, and while there's a little bit of a headwind, it's fully embedded in our guidance, and it's not a meaningful number. And so that's how we looked at. Rafael Tejada : Operator, we have time for one more question? Operator : Yes. Certainly. Our next question is from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Puneet, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda : Hi, Marc. Thanks for taking my question. I'll wrap my question in one. On the biopharma side and the biotech side, could you elaborate what you're hearing from your larger biopharma large cap customers versus the early emerging biotechs? And another brief question on the therapeutic side. Marc, about 75% of the IND filings to the FDA in 2024 are molecules from China or assets from China, and that number used to be very small in 2023 and practically nothing in 2019. So my question is if more of the drug discovery pivots to China, how do you think Thermo is positioned? What are the implications for Thermo and for the tools industry overall, if you could? Thank you. Marc Casper : Yes. So Puneet, thanks for the question. So what's -- what I love about January, there's many things I love about January, but is I get to spend an enormous time with our customers, right, both out in the West Coast, where many convene, as well as in Europe. So I've seen quite a number of customers. And if I say what are the themes, if I start with the larger customers, the larger biopharma, really a real change in confidence like really quite positive in terms of how they enter the year feeling like the actions that they've taken over the last couple of years have put their companies in a good spot. Obviously, some companies are benefiting hugely from the GLP-1s and there's great confidence there, obviously, for the impact. And that excites everybody in terms of the ability to have very relevant medicines that can get adopted quickly and help human health. And so actually, it feels to me that large pharma is meaningfully in a better mind space, which will help over time, grow budgets. And when I think about the more of emerging customers, actually, that also was positive, right? And there seems to be a reasonable confidence on funding and partnerships to allow for funding to continue to improve as the year unfolds. And still recovering, but certainly better. In terms of where innovation is, I think, ultimately, what you're seeing as, a few years back, it became really very difficult for a China-based company to serve the global market, you're seeing more licensing deals. There's a huge amount of work that happens in the Western labs after things are licensed. So we're well positioned in China, but we're obviously well positioned globally. Marc Casper : So thank you for the question. Let me wrap up with just a couple of quick things. First of all, thanks, everyone, for participating in the call today. We entered this year with strong momentum, and we're in a great position to deliver an excellent 2025. As always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. And we look forward to updating you as the year progresses. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you very much, everyone, for joining us. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
