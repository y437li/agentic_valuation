[Operator Instructions] Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to the company's Executive Chairman, Mr. Earl Congdon. Please go ahead, sir. Earl E. Congdon: Good morning. Thanks for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. With me this morning is David Congdon, Old Dominion's President and CEO; and Wes Frye, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. It is a pleasure to report that Old Dominion continued to excel in the first quarter of 2014, producing our best first quarter operating ratio, net income and income per share, as well as the highest quarterly revenue we have ever achieved in any quarter. We produced these strong results despite the severe and widespread winter weather experienced for most of the quarter. This performance highlights the dedication of the OD family throughout the company. Our employees not only demonstrated their commitment to getting the job done, but also the training and skills to operate in difficult conditions. Our performance also shows the strength of our value proposition as we worked through significantly productive -- productivity headwinds to deliver on our promise of superior on time claims-free service. With almost 14% growth in the LTL tons for the quarter, we believe our performance shows the market's growing recognition of our value proposition. Simply put, Old Dominion is performing at a level better than I've ever seen with a more strongly differentiated competitive market position than ever before. We also have the best financial position in our history, and a highly experienced management team that has proven to be an outstanding steward of our shareholder capital. Last year, we produced over an 18% return on average equity for our shareholders. We believe we are well-positioned to expand our business for the foreseeable future, driving increased earnings and shareholder value. Thank you for joining us, our call today, and now here is David Congdon. David S. Congdon: Good morning, and welcome to all you this morning. We've had a great quarter to begin 2014. While many variables affect any quarter, we think one of the simplest explanations of our strong first quarter performance is evident in our outstanding service metrics. Despite severe -- extended severe weather across most of our network, we actually improved our cargo claim ratio to 0.26% of revenue, over 20% better than the first quarter last year. This is the best cargo claim ratio we have ever known to be achieved in the LTL industry. And our team produced it in the depths of one of the worst winters we've seen in years. Despite the difficult weather conditions, we still achieved a 99% on-time record for -- on-time service for the quarter. We believe the consistency of our superior service performance, despite horrible weather, had a lot to do with our growth in comparable month LTL tons per day, which started in the double digits for January and accelerated each month of the quarter. The shift of the Easter weekend to the second quarter this year from the first quarter last year contributed to the 19.7% increase in LTL tons per day for March versus March 2013. We continue to benefit from a rational pricing environment in the first quarter, in part because excess industry capacity remains limited. Our LTL revenue per hundred weight excluding fuel surcharge increased a solid 2.2%, even with the downward pressure exerted on this metric by increased weight per shipment and a lower average length of haul. In addition, like our experience with LTL tons per day, we're continuing to see strong performance in LTL revenue per hundred weight thus far in the second quarter. As reflected in our tonnage growth and pricing, our increased density and yield for the first quarter drove the 70 basis-point improvement in our operating ratio. We were pleased with the strength of this performance, given the impact of weather-related reduced productivity in our pickup and delivery and our dock operations. Pressure on these metrics during the quarter was primarily related to our willingness to incur short-term operating inefficiencies during the poor weather in order to maintain our commitment to on-time customer service. In addition, we continue to experience inefficiencies associated with hiring and training new employees to address our higher volume and the continued impact of the more restrictive hours of service regulations. As we look forward to the remainder of 2014 and beyond, we expect continued gains in market share will result in improved density. Given the stable economy, we also expect further improvements in our yield. Our yield discipline and philosophy have not changed. We'll continue to analyze the profitability of each shipment and customer for the services we provide. We are confident that we will recover the productivity lost in the first quarter and produce further gains over time. Our long-term investments in productivity enhancing technology has historically resulted in improved operating margin, and we have no shortage of investment opportunities ahead. We continue to believe that in -- by improving density, yield and productivity, we can generate incremental operating margin of at least 15% to 20%. With significant improvement in our first quarter density and yield, offset in part by productivity headwinds, our incremental margin was 17% for the first quarter. Primary focus for Old Dominion, moving forward, will remain execution. Our company is positioned for growth with a proven business model, a value proposition driving increased demand, and the personnel and financial resources to maximize the opportunities before us. By continuing our long-term record of superior execution, we also expect to extend our long-term record of value creation. Thanks for being with us today, and now, I'll ask Wes to review our financial results for the first quarter in greater detail. J. Wes Frye : Thank you, David, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenues grew 15.2% to a company record $620.3 million for the first quarter of 2014 from $538.4 million for the first quarter last year. Our third consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth was driven by a 13.9% increase in LTL tons for the quarter, above our expectation of 11% to 11.5%. This increase reflected an 11.9% increase in LTL shipments and a 1.8% increase in weight per shipment. LTL revenue per hundred weight increased 1.6% for the first quarter, while LTL revenue per hundred weight excluding fuel surcharge increased 2.2%, which was consistent with our expectation of 2% to 2.5%. This 2.2% increase in the revenue per hundred weight includes the negative impact of a 1.8% increase in weight per shipment, as well as a 0.6% decline in length of haul. For the first quarter of 2014, LTL tons per day increased sequentially by 4.1% from January -- from December, 5% for February and 8.5% for March. In addition, LTL tons per day for January 2014 increased 10.1% compared with January 2013 with increases of 11.7% and 19.7% for February and March, respectively. We estimate April LTL tonnage to be approximately 14.5%, up versus the same period last year. In the second quarter of 2014, we expect LTL tons per day to increase in a range of 14% to 14.5% compared to the second quarter of 2013. We expect revenue per hundred weight, excluding fuel surcharge, to be in a range of 2% and 2.5% for the second quarter, reflecting continued mix changes toward higher weighted contractual business and a decrease in length of haul due to increased volume in our next-day and 2-day regional lanes. Old Dominion's operating ratio improved 70 basis points for the first quarter to an 87.1 from an 87.8 for the first quarter of 2013. Our direct labor improved as percentage of revenue, driven primarily by increased operating leverage, although increases in group health expense and weather-related productivity declines offset much of those improvements. We also benefited from efficient fuel and fleet management that contributed to a 70 basis-point reduction in operating supplies and expense during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $79.8 million for the first quarter of 2014, which included approximately $18 million of our $47 million 2014 budget for technology and other assets. As we discussed last quarter, these expenditures reflect a launch of a 3- to 5-year process to expand and enhance our technology platform to prepare for anticipated growth trajectory for the next 10 to 20 years. In addition, today, we announced that we're increasing our planned capital expenditures by $25 million for 2014 for additional tractors and trailers, as a result of our strong volume for the first quarter and our expectation for the remainder of the year. Therefore, we now estimate CapEx for 2014 will total approximately $367 million, including planned expenditures of $132 million for real estate; $188 million for tractors, trailers and other equipment; and $47 million for technology and other assets. We expect the sale of assets due in 2014 to be approximately $9 million or a total net CapEx of approximately $358 million. And we expect to fund these expenditures primarily through operating clash -- cash flow, as well as our available borrowing capacity if necessary. Total debt to total capitalization improved to 12.4% at the end of the first quarter 2014 from 13.4% at the end of 2013. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2014 was 40.6% compared with 36.1% for the first quarter of 2013, and our expected effective tax rate of 39% for the remainder of 2014. The increase in our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2014 was due primarily to the expiration of favorable tax credits in 2013 and other discreet tax adjustments. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning, and operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for additional questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Bill Greene from Morgan Stanley. William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Wes, maybe you can talk a little bit about how you're thinking about where this tonnage growth is coming from in terms of market share? I've got to believe that when you outgrow the market by that amount, it's perhaps destabilizing to some of the competitors out there. Do you worry at all at this sort of growth leads to maybe a less rational pacing environment? Where they say like, \"Gosh, we got to win some of this back. This is unbelievable how much these guys are growing.\" J. Wes Frye : Well, as David mentioned in his comments, during the quarter, I mean, we saw fairly stable pricing and that's what we've seen for quite a while now. Where it came from, it's difficult to say. Obviously, much of it came from market share. We can't really say if it came from macro, although we were okay with the macro during the quarter from what we can see in our discussions with customers. But I don't think, that -- I don't think it will result in any accelerated pricing from the sector overall. I don't think any of us can afford that, especially as we continue to reinvest, and I say we, and I'm talking about the sector, reinvest in our network in our rolling stock. David S. Congdon: I'll add to that, Bill. As we look at our growth across the country, every one of our operating regions had very -- have had very nice growth. It's been pretty similar to the path that the Northern half of country has been. And Midwest and Northeast has been a little bit stronger, say than the south, but what it's look like so far is it's really uniform across the entire network. Earl E. Congdon: I'd like to add, it's Earl Congdon. Also, it's not price that's getting this growth for us. It's customer service and that low claims ratio. William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Is it too simplistic of me to think that, if you use that strong service level in the market to get a bit higher price, a little bit lower tonnage growth, if that's not a better outcome? Is that too simplistic, the way I phrase that? Earl E. Congdon: We're getting that outcome, aren't we? William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Yes. I mean, I don't mean to take anything away from the results. They were obviously very solid. But it's more just like we look at the fact that the yields have come down, the tonnage growth is so significant you're going to have to -- you have to up CapEx. And that's okay, like there's nothing wrong with that outcome except that is there a mix change here that you can sort of push toward a little bit higher price, and therefore, even more on the margin, and therefore, returns? Maybe that's not a way to do it. J. Wes Frye : I can't speak for the rest of the sector, but some of that growth was based upon the comparison, and by that, I mean in January, our tonnage was up about 10.1. In February, the tonnage increased to 11.7, and we had this very large growth in March of 19.7. But I think some of that wasn't necessarily market share or macro. It was just because March last year had that Easter holiday at the end of the year, and that would explain some of that. So that's not necessarily increased volume, but just a comparison from what it was last year. David S. Congdon: And some the March growth could also be some slop over of business that did not move in January and February due to weather contributed to that. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC: So when you have a quarter like this you don't have to talk much about weather, but you think that maybe -- what's your sense on what the impact of weather may have been on the tonnage and the cost? J. Wes Frye : Well, it's difficult to address the tonnage when you had almost 14%. And so, I'll just relate to the cost, I can't really make a discussion on the revenue level. But from a cost standpoint, I think, Scott, the relevant thing is -- here is, not only what it cost us this quarter, but even though we had horrible weather this quarter, we did have some weather last year. And also, some of our increased costs is due to volume increases. So it gets a little tricky trying to separate all those costs between the relative increase in weather headwinds and also the increased volume. But my best estimate on what those incremental costs, keep in mind, I said incremental, not the cost this quarter, is about $4.5 million to $5 million in increased operating cost due to linehaul, motels, snow removals and those type of related costs. That is the cost that I estimate over what it was last year, about $4.5 million to $5 million. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay. That is -- that's helpful. And then just 1 follow-up on the tonnage. Do you think that -- do you feel like you had any material amount of spillover from truckload just given capacity issues that they saw in truckload? And when you think of about this level of tonnage growth, is the $25 million increase in CapEx enough or do we need to start thinking about more material increases, just to handle this amount of growth? J. Wes Frye : Just to talk about the volume and the spot quotes, we saw a little bit of an increase. But keep in mind, we don't -- we manage that increase. We do not want a lot of truckload business on this on the truckline because we're an LTL carrier, and that's what the cost of our network should include, that cost. But -- so that wasn't that much, but we maybe saw a little bit. As far as the level of equipment, I mean, we haven't given any guidance on tonnage for the rest of the year other than what we're seeing, and we gave some estimated tonnage growth, obviously, for the second quarter. So we obviously based our initial CapEx for equipment on one number, but obviously, that number is higher. And we think that at this point, the additional equipment that we put into play and ordered will be sufficient to handle that estimated increase volume for the year. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Chris Wetherbee from Citi. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Just kind of curious, when you think about just the overall business, taking a step back for a second, if you look at the tonnage growth, which is very, very strong and outlook for second quarter also very strong, it seems like there's a bit of an inflection going on in the business the last several quarters. I don't know if you can speak to that necessarily, but is there anything that you're doing differently outside of the very, very stellar sort of cargo claims and continued good service, which I think has been your hallmark for many years? That ultimately is sparking that change. It doesn't seem like the underlying economy is picking up that much. Just curious, what's going on from a market dynamic perspective that may change that. David S. Congdon: Chris, David here. The -- honestly, we believe our service performance is what is winning market share, as Earl pointed out here a minute ago. And I think, it's going to be interesting to see what really comes out with all the rest of the carrier's reports, because we haven't heard that much about volume increases, and so forth. It'll be interesting to see how the industry sector fares for the quarter to see if maybe there's been any inflection in the economy. Perhaps, it hasn\u2019t surfaced yet. So we will just have to wait and see how that looks. But again, service performance, we believe, is driving our tonnage growth. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. I guess we'll see how that plays out the rest of the carriers. When you think about the network and how it stands right now, given that very robust growth you've had in last couple of quarters, I know, obviously, adding to the CapEx side, I think you said trailer -- tractors and trailers was the main focus. When you think about sort of the network geographically, any pinch points we need to worry about? I know you opened a couple of terminals in the last quarter, so just wanted to get a rough sense if there's anywhere else that might need some incremental maybe real estate capital or otherwise? David S. Congdon: No, Chris. We're really in good shape across the entire network. No pinch points. Thanks to all the CapEx we've invested in the last year or 2 to solve some of the pinch points that we had in 2012 and '13. Operator : And our next question will come from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : David, I was curious if you could talk about your philosophy on a general rate increase this year? David S. Congdon: Well, our philosophy on that is to generally look at our cost, and look at our various cost of doing business increases, and to pass on what we believe, is a fair and equitable increase in our rates. Also, if you look at our GRIs that we put in over the last several years, we've been fairly consistent in 4% to 4.5% range, maybe, I think 4.9% is about the highest that we've announced in last 2 to 3 years, and this just appears to be what we need to do and what we need to pass on. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : So does that -- I think that historically you've done your wage increase sometime in the third quarter. Does that mean that the general rate increase might be more closely aligned with when you're going to -- or when you have historically done your wage increases? David S. Congdon: No. Our wage increase has typically been September. We don't have any intention at this point of changing that timing. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : But with the general rate increase more closely, if you did a general rate increase, would the expectation be that, that would be most closely aligned with the wage increases? David S. Congdon: Are you talking about the percentage of wage increase? Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Timing. David S. Congdon: We're not -- are you -- we've already announced our GRI. You're aware of that, right, Todd? Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : I'm sorry, I was thinking about the impact of the GRI with the wage increases into the second quarter. So the wage increases are going to be -- you haven't said anything on the wage increase side, I guess, is what I was thinking about. David S. Congdon: We normally increase on the first Friday in September. It's when our wage increases go into effect. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then just my follow-up on that, I guess, is could you talk about the labor availability? Talking about growing -- with the tonnage growth that you're seeing right now increasing the rolling side. We've heard a lot about the labor market right now, particularly on the driver side. And I guess, this is why I was trying to get ultimately, your ability to attract and bring in labor right now, given the growth that you're seeing? David S. Congdon: We're not having any problem of attracting good, qualified people to our company. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : And no pressure on wages then as a result of that? David S. Congdon: No. We pay a very, very competitive wages and benefit package. And we don't see any pressure to do anything out of the ordinary as it relates to compensation. We attract employees. Operator : And our next question will come from David Ross from Stifel. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Can you talk a little bit about your sales force growth year-over-year? Do you have a lot more feet on the street now, driving this tonnage growth, or is it mostly coming from the existing guys that are out there selling the business? David S. Congdon: It's mostly coming from the existing guys. We've had some increase in the sales force, but nothing, nothing dramatic at all. It's just winning business from existing accounts, continuing to win new accounts that are coming onboard with the company. And just general growth and improvements in density across the board. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : And then I guess, if you had to look at the overall tonnage growth numbers and divide that up between tonnage that came from existing accounts, whether it be them doing more business or you getting a bigger share of their business versus new accounts, how would that first quarter tonnage growth break down? David S. Congdon: We don\u2019t have a breakdown on that. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. You think it's more than half from existing or do think it's mostly from new? Earl E. Congdon: I would just say, just a gut feel, just probably at least half and -- a bit half and half. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : And then last question just on the equipment side. The additional tractors and trailers you're bringing on, are those predominantly Freightliner and Wabash? Earl E. Congdon: Yes. David S. Congdon: Yes. Operator : And our next question will come from Brad Delco with Stephens Investment Bank. A. Brad Delco - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Wes, I wanted to ask you, I guess, first on the margin. I guess, you identified $4.5 million to $5 million of cost in the first quarter. Is there anything else in terms of maybe Easter or anything else that would cause sequential margins to not follow normal historical trends? Or should we just assume, given the amount of tonnage growth versus your yield guidance that kind of 15% to 20% incrementals is what we should be thinking about in the near term, or is there anything that would adjust that for 2Q? J. Wes Frye : Well, we've -- I don't know what you -- our definition of normal that we said for years is incremental margins of 15% to 20%, and we've produced higher than that the best with the other -- with certain characteristics being different. In 2010 and 2011, when we were producing 30% plus margins, I mean, we had a lot of excess capacity, not only in network, but also in people, in labor. And pricing, quite frankly, was on the rebound. We're getting 4% and 5% increases in the yield. So that wasn't normal, but we think that this environment is more normal. And that's why we keep saying that our incremental margins should be in the 15% to 20% range. Now having said that, as we said many times, if those ingredients of that incremental margin, which would include a macro that's behaving, a price discipline in the sector, and with our own ability to leverage the density, that is no reason we shouldn't be maybe too [indiscernible] at the top that range. But keep in mind that the 17% that we produced in the first quarter did have some headwinds on the productivity. The comp [ph] is due to weather and other cost that I kind of gave you a range of, so we're still in that 15% to 20% range. Keeping in mind that 20% incremental margin represents an eighty OR. That's not bad. A. Brad Delco - Stephens Inc., Research Division : No, no. By no means is it bad. But -- and then I guess sort of longer-term, I mean you guys aren't skimping at all on CapEx. You're still declining your debt-to-cap. I mean, at some point, you're going to have a high-dollar problem where you could be debt free and still investing a tremendous amount of CapEx relative to your peers. What other thoughts have you guys had in terms of the use of that capital, considering you're already growing at likely industry best growth rates and at industry best margins? J. Wes Frye : Well, a gulf stream [ph] wouldn't be bad, but -- no, we've had many discussions with excess cash and obviously, we are considering and have considered in evaluating returning some of the cash to shareholders. Whether that's in the form of stock repurchases or dividends, we're still looking at those alternatives. But we are under evaluation of those alternatives going forward, Brad. David S. Congdon: But the primary thing that we're going to invest in is investing in the company, and if that continues to generate 18% or so return on equity as we did last year, we think that's a pretty good return to our shareholders as well. So number one is to continue to look at opportunities to grow our business profitably, before we consider using that excess cash for those other purposes Wes mentioned. Earl E. Congdon: Well said. A. Brad Delco - Stephens Inc., Research Division : And maybe 1 quick question for you, Wes. Tax rate outlook going forward, I don\u2019t know if you provided that, but what should we be modeling? J. Wes Frye : I did. 39% is what I mentioned for the remainder of the year. Operator : And our next question will come from Allison Landry from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I wanted to ask about the use of third-party brokers and to get your thoughts on whether you think this has contributed to the consistent increases in weight per shipment that we've seen for the last several quarters? And following on that from a strategic perspective, could you maybe talk about what you might be doing differently with respect to the way that you use brokers relative to some of your peers? I think you've mentioned in the past that you used the brokers to show some of your backhaul moves? So I was just wondering if I was thinking about that correctly. J. Wes Frye : No, I'm not sure that sure you're, Allison. When you say third-party brokers, you're talking about 3PLs, and about 25% of our LTL business does come from 3PLs. Now, if you look at -- you're discussing purchase transportation, that's another sector. And we use purchase transportation -- that's another matter. So I'm not sure which one you're referring to. About 25% of our revenue is through 3PLs. But it has nothing really to do with the weight per shipment. David S. Congdon: Backhaul. J. Wes Frye : Or backhauls. Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : It doesn't have to do with backhaul. Okay. I guess I was just thinking that there was a tendency for freight that comes from the brokers to just generally be a higher weight per shipment. So I didn't know if that was a trend that you were seeing. David S. Congdon: Not really. The 3PL -- any given 3PL might have 5 or 6 or 10 or 20 or 30 different customers that they bring -- might bring to us. And the changes in weight per shipment, could just be -- just the natural evolution of customers you happen to bring home on the truck line. But also, hopefully, the economy's turned a little bit. It'll be interesting to see what the rest of the carriers report. And usually, with an improving economy you start to get slightly larger weight per shipment, at least that's been the historical trend over the years. So maybe the economy is infecting a little bit. But the other thing we do as far as strategic use of brokers, we just consider -- we don't call them brokers per se. We call then third-party logistics companies. They've been infiltrating the LTL marketplace for many, many years and we just work with those 3PLs on each individual customer they bring to us and we treat those customers just the same way as if we were dealing direct with the customer without a 3PL in terms of analyzing the freight and analyzing the profitability of that freight, given the service -- services that the customer needs. Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Got it. And so I guess, is it sort of fair to think about the increased use of the 3PL's as having an impact on purchase transportation cost or maybe we'll see those move. David S. Congdon: That has nothing to do with the purchase transportation cost. Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, okay. That's helpful. And just my second question. I found it interesting that you guys took action sort of and really a hit on your productivity to make sure that shipments made it to customers on time. So I was just curious, did you -- did customers understand that you guys did this? And what was sort of their reaction? And is this something that could potentially just bolster your general ability to take market share and get solid price? David S. Congdon: Well, I think they noticed, and I think that our tonnage growth is reflective of them noticing. So what the future holds for that continuing is yet to be seen. Operator : And our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird. Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : So I guess, along that line of questioning about utilization of third-party logistics providers, it doesn\u2019t sounds like, Wes, that the number it changed or the amount of revenue you generated from those third-party logistics providers in the first quarter was any different than what you've talked about in the past, it's 25%. And it's probably too granular for me to ask how that trended through the quarter, because I'm interested in that March number, in particular, and some of these anecdotes about truckloads being broken up and put into LTL networks. You get a sense for whether that took place in March that helped the March number? And the fact that you guys do have healthy relationships with these third-party logistics providers help facilitate some of that? Can you provide any perspective to that? J. Wes Frye : As David mentioned, third-party logistics is -- the only difference in third-party logistics and directly with customers is we deal with the third-party logistics. We still go underneath those logistics company and look at the customers and provide those customers with high levels of service. And so, I don't really see a relationship there with growth in March due to third-party or anyone else. It's just overall volumes coming on board. Earl E. Congdon: And the Easter holiday. J. Wes Frye : And the Easter holiday was fairly substantial. Remember not only did Easter fall into the first, quarter last year it fell into the last day of the quarter. And so, and some of that -- whatever we did pick up and move on that last day of March 2013 probably flowed over into April, making the swing of the comparisons a little bit funky, so to speak. Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. But we have heard instances of the tightness in truckload capacity forcing some truckloads being broken up and put into LTL networks. And just the trajectory of the volume growth through the quarters would suggest that you might've seen some of that. But did you have any insight in terms of whether that was happening and whether you guys were taking advantage of some of that in March and into April? J. Wes Frye : As I mentioned, we saw our volume loads -- when I say volume, for us, that's in the 8,000 to 10,000 pound shipments, did increase some. But it wasn't like it was twice the normal growth or twice what the LTL. It was just in line, basically, with what the LTL growth was. Operator : And our next question comes from Thomas Kim, Goldman Sachs. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Wanted to ask with regard to the cost structure. We've seen several of your cost constituents rising with revenue and sellers is one of them. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your headcount requirements as you grow the business. And then, also what's the best way for us to be thinking about labor productivity, given the ongoing reinvestment in the business? David S. Congdon: Our headcount has definitely increased from last -- that really began last fall. We're fairly stable with the headcount from -- remain fairly stable with the headcount from November all the way through February. But we started increasing headcount again in March, based on the tonnage we were seeing. But the productivity pounds per hour, bills per hour and things like that, that we watched took a little bit of a -- were hit a little bit due to the winter weather and due to the training of all these new people that we brought on board. But as we -- I'd say right now, from the headcount standpoint, we're probably pretty stable going through April, May and June, and all of those new employees will become more and more productive as they get more used to this -- the work that they do. So we should see some improvements in labor productivity in the second quarter versus the first, because of the new employees getting more educated as to what they need to do. And secondly, with the spring coming and then lack of a cold weather and snow and ice and all the things we had in the first quarter. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And then, can you give us a -- your sort of guidance as to what your year-end headcount numbers should be? Like, at the end of the year, what would that growth look like? David S. Congdon: Well, we -- Tom, we don't give guidance on growth. So that would be an element of that guidance. So we're not prepared to give that number. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. Again, if I can just ask 1 last question. If we sort of look at cost ex-labor, can you break down the fix versus variable component for -- the one area that I'm more interested in is the operating supplies and expenses. So if we look at that, just that cost constituent, can you give us a breakdown of fix versus variable? David S. Congdon: On -- excluding labor? Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : So the operating supplies and expense, just that category. I was wondering what the fixed versus variable component was. David S. Congdon: Most, by definition, most of the operating supply and expense line are variable cost. But you also, to some extent, you have to run certain peddle runs out in the areas regardless how much freight you got on the trucks. So some portion of that variable cost is... Earl E. Congdon: It depends on the time frame. On the hourly basis, all costs are fixed, on a yearly basis, all costs are variable. It depends on the timeframe. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And I'm just trying to understand with regard to the potential operating leverage. Obviously, it's a little complicated by the fact that you are growing and I'm just trying to parse out the growth that's attributable to the ongoing reinvestment versus the organic growth. But I appreciate looking in that there are a lot of moving parts there. Operator : And our next question comes from Rob Salmon from Deutsche Bank. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : On the fourth quarter, you guys had called out the hours of service as being a headwind to the linehaul network. Could you give us an update in terms of how you guys have adjusted the networks? Because if I'm look at the salary wages and benefits line item, it didn't increase sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter as much as it traditionally does, which could imply that you guys have kind of rightsized the network now where it needs to be. David S. Congdon: Rob, I'd say, we're definitely -- we had to make adjustments to that as primarily a 34-hour restart, which caused us in the third quarter of last year to add some extra road drivers to pick up the slack from the work that the existing road drivers and existing city drivers could not do on weekends. So that slack was picked up in the third quarter. So the cost levels and what you're seeing in our linehaul cost component, say, in the fourth quarter and what we have in the first quarter is pretty stable with what it ought to be going forward. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : David, that color is really helpful. Just a quick follow-up in terms of the network capacity, clearly, you're adding a few extra tractors given the strong growth that you guys experienced in the months of March, April in Q1. Can you give us a sense of how much spare capacity there is on the linehaul fleet right now? David S. Congdon: On linehaul, we don't really track capacity. We try to maintain a certain percent of capacity. Of course, that fluctuates by week, by month, by quarter. And on seasonality, but I would say, anywhere from 5% to 10% on our fleet. I mean, is that the best number we have. You don\u2019t operate your equipment with a lot of capacity. But you don\u2019t operate your equipment with no capacity either. J. Wes Frye : It normally increases purchase transportation also if you get an unexpected surge [indiscernible]. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : That's fair. So sounds pretty stable to kind of hit historical numbers. David S. Congdon: Our equipment obviously is stable and -- but we've -- with our tonnage increases year-to-date, we thought that we probably should increase our number of equipment, which we have. So I mean, that's our expectation. Operator : Our next call will come from Willard Milby, BB&T Capital Markets. Willard P. Milby - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Kind of want to ask the question everybody had been dancing around a little bit, but a little bit different way. Can you give your percentage growth in shipments over 5,000 pounds and also over 10,000 pounds? J. Wes Frye : We don't necessarily even track that. That's -- I don't have those numbers in front of me, of what those numbers are. Willard P. Milby - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. Also the tonnage guidance 14% to 14.5% that's LTL only, correct? J. Wes Frye : Correct. Operator : At this time, we have 1 question remaining in the queue. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Todd Fowler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Just a follow-up on that last question. Wes, do you have a restated LTL tonnage number for the second quarter of '13? J. Wes Frye : Todd, when we issue our first quarter, our 10-Q for the first quarter, we'll provide a table for each of the remaining quarters of 2013 is give you those tonnage numbers. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. But so the 14% to 14.5% that you gave today, that's not going to be comparable to what you had for the second quarter of '13, the number that we have in our models? J. Wes Frye : It will not. Now the relationship should be fairly consistent with total tonnage and LTL tonnage. But we'll get you those numbers when we file the 10-Q, of what those restated numbers from 2013 are. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Just directionally, if we look at the restatement for the first quarter, would the magnitude be somewhat similar in the second quarter, just for kind of a zip code or ballpark? J. Wes Frye : Yes, yes. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : And then just the last one I had. Wes, do you have any comments on expectations for depreciation expense, given the increase in CapEx, either how we should think about it, on a dollar basis or percent basis now in '14 versus '13? J. Wes Frye : I would say, as percent of revenue, once the year is done, the percentage revenue for depreciation will be fairly flat between 2013 and 2014. Operator : And our next question will be from Matt Brooklier from Longbow Research. Matthew S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC : So I have a kind of a higher-level question. As 3PLs become kind of the larger percentage of the overall market, what are your thoughts on 3PLs' impact on overall market pricing? And is it a positive for pricing? Is it a negative for pricing overall? Or is it -- does it not have an impact on market pricing? David S. Congdon: Matt, I believe that a lot of it has to do with how the carriers deal with the third-party logistics firms. As we've stated in -- today, and we think it is very important to look at each and every customer that a third-party logistics firm brings to your company and to determine your pricing based upon the merits of those individual shippers. Because oftentimes the 3PLs are looking for some kind of a blanket discount that they could apply to every time they can hear that they want to apply it to. And I think, that is what has gotten so many of the players in the LTL space in trouble. And if they would -- so, then that's not something that we have done. So -- I'm just not -- our thoughts on how to deal with it and we would hope others would listen to these comments. Matthew S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And the 3PLs contribute I think 25% of your total volume at this point in time. Does that number stay about the same over the longer-term? Does that number grow? Are you guys thinking about shrinking kind of your relationship with 3PLs and the total amount of volume that they contribute in a given quarter? David S. Congdon: We view 3PLs as an extension of our sales force. And we have very good relationships with our 3PL partners. And we're not trying to necessarily grow that segment of the business, nor shrink that segment. If we have a good relationship with our 3PL customers, we could do with most. Our goal is to grow with each and every one of them. Operator : And our next question is from Jason Seidl from Cowen and Company. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : I promise no 3PL questions for me. Listen, Wes, you mentioned capacity in terms of your equipment. You used to think about 5% or 10%. But your growth rates are very, very impressive compared to the rest of the industry. And how long can you grow at double-digit rates until you have to add physical capacity? Are we talking another year, another 2 years? On a terminal side. David S. Congdon: Well, Jason, when you look at term loan capacity, and our most basic way we look at it is pounds per door per day, you'll find some service centers that have 50% to 60% capacity, some of the small ones. You find some that are up there in the 80% to 90% of maximum capacity. And therein lies our continued investment in real estate, because you're always having some of the service centers that are up at the upper end of the capacity limits. And based upon those, our future projected growth in those service centers, we're just -- we'll have incremental investments in real estate for the foreseeable future as we continue to strive for double-digit market share in the LTL space. But we've been investing in the same way for the last decade, and you've seen the results that we've been able to achieve in our operating ratio, despite those investments in those service centers. So it's just -- there'll be some incremental -- some ratio of sales, maybe Wes would say... J. Wes Frye : Well, we acquired. Yes, we -- as David mentioned, even though we may have service centers that are at 80% or 90% capacity, that doesn\u2019t mean that we already aren't looking at expanding those facilities. As a matter of fact, we have 5 or 6 facilities right now going on that's either moving to a larger facility or expanding an existing facility. So that's just something we inherently do. Obviously, when you expand a facility, you don't expand it to take care of your volume for the next 1 or 2 years. You expand it to take care of your volume for a longer-term. Earl E. Congdon: I think it will be fair to say that we're in better shape, as far as the capacity of our real estate is concerned, than we've been in years. We're in better shape for taking on additional business than we have been on the past because of the money that we spent on these real estate... J. Wes Frye : We've invested almost $1 billion in real estate over the last 8, 9, 10 years. So we continuously do that and will. Operator : It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Earl Congdon, I'd like to turn the conference back to you, for additional or closing remarks. Earl E. Congdon: Well, guys as always, we thank you for your participation today. We appreciate your questions, and most of all, your support for Old Dominion. So give us a call, if you have any further questions. Thank you and good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to the company's Executive Chairman, Mr. Earl Congdon. Please go ahead, sir. Earl Congdon : Good morning. Thanks for joining us today for our second quarter conference call. With me this morning is David Congdon, Old Dominion's President and CEO; and Wes Frye, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. For the second quarter, Old Dominion continued to produce strong profitable growth. Our revenue and earnings growth accelerated to their highest rates in over a year, with a 19.1% increase in revenue, driving a 26.5% increase in earnings per diluted share. With our revenue growth far outstripping growth in the economy, we believe we are continuing to gain meaningful market share. As we've discussed with you often, we believe our ability to deliver superior on-time claims-free service differentiates Old Dominion in the LTL industry and has driven not only our long-term growth in market share, but one of the industry's strongest financial performances over the short intermediate and long-term. Even though we grew tonnage at a double-digit level for the second quarter and were faced with productivity pressure brought on by expanding our workforce to handle such strong volume, we maintained 99% on-time delivery and our cargo claims ratio stayed at an exceptional 0.26% for the second quarter in a row. Our ability to produce this superior serviced performance, particularly in a quarter where tons increased at a rate that exceeded our expectations, again [validates] the strength of our organization and our commitment to our service. To achieve these results while also producing a 82.5 operating ratio validates our business model and the continuous investment in our people, capacity and technology. To put it simply, Old Dominion continues to stand apart from the rest of our industry, and we are committed to raising the bar further on what it means to provide competitive LTL services. With continued execution, we are confident that we can achieve our long-term growth objectives, driving further growth in shareholder value. Thank you for joining us in our conference call today. And now here is David Congdon. David Congdon : Good morning to you, all. We've had another great performance for the second quarter, demonstrating our continued earnings momentum. While we've now produced our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, the last two quarters have especially highlighted the company's outperformance of the LTL industry. We came through very poor winter weather with outstanding results in the first quarter. And even with Easter in the second quarter, we exceeded our high second quarter expectations for growth in turns and revenue per hundredweight. This market position reflects the increasing demand for our high-quality services, which is evident in our expanding market share. For the second quarter, this demand drove our strong growth in turns per day and supported better than expected revenue per hundredweight in a pricing environment that has remained fairly rational. The resulting expansion in freight density and yield was primarily responsible for producing further operating leverage and incremental margins of 22.3% compared with the second quarter last year. In addition for the quarter, we achieved an operating ratio of 82.5, which is the best quarterly OR we have ever produced and is 100 basis points better than our previous record, which was set in the second quarter last year. Looking forward, our objective is to expand our market share into double-digits by focusing on the continued execution of our proven business model. There will inevitably be challenges on our path to this goal. However, having proven the strength of our business model throughout the economic cycle, we are confident that Old Dominion will continue to produce long-term growth in its financial results and shareholder value. Thanks for being with us today. And now, I'll ask Wes to review our financial results for the quarter in greater detail. Wes Frye : Thank you, David, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue reached a record $703 million for the second quarter of 2014, an increase of 19.1% from $509.3 million for the second quarter of 2013. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by a 14.9% increase in LTL tons for the quarter, above our expectations of 14%, 14.5%. This increase reflected a 12% increase in LTL shipments and a 2.6% increase in LTL weight per shipment. Also contributing to the revenue growth, LTL revenue per hundredweight for the second quarter increased 3.7% or 3.6% excluding fuel surcharges despite the impact of a 2.6% increase in weight per shipment and a 1.4% decline in our average length of haul. This increase in revenue per hundredweight just exceeded the high end of our expectation of 3% to 3.5% for the quarter. Our results for the quarter also include the impact of a 4.3% general weight increase that was effective on May 1. Directional changes in weight per shipment and length of haul have been consistent now for 10 consecutive quarters, reflecting the ongoing shift in our freight mix to higher weight contractual business and to increased volume in our next-day and two-day regional lanes. The second quarter of 2014 monthly LTL tons per day decreased 1.6% from April to March, increased 3.4% for May and 3.3% for June. Historically, sequential trends for April, May and June increased by 1.2%, 0.3% and 2% respectively. On a comparable quarter basis, LTL tons per day increased 4.1% for April, 15.5% for May and 14.8% for June. And we estimate July LTL tonnage to be approximately up 18% versus the same period last year. In the third quarter of 2014, assuming normalized sequential trends, we expect LTL tons per day to increase in a range of 17% to 18% compared to the third quarter of 2013. We expect revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, to be up in a range of 2% to 2.5% for the third quarter compared to the third quarter of last year. Old Dominion's operating ratio improved 100 basis points to 82.5% for the second quarter from 83.5% for the second quarter of 2013, driven primarily by our increased freight density and yield. We also continued to benefit from savings from fuel purchasing strategies and fuel efficiencies, which contributed to a 50 basis point reduction in our operating supplies and expense. Capital expenditures were $138.8 million for the second quarter of 2014 and $218.6 million for the first half of the year. We estimate CapEx for the entire year of 2014 will total approximately $375 million, including planned expenditures of $132 million for real estate, $196 million for tractors, trailers and other equipment, $47 million for technology and other assets. We expect sales of assets during 2014 to be approximately $20 million for a total net CapEx of approximately $355 million. And we expect to fund these expenditures primarily through operating cash flow as well as our available borrowing capacity if necessary. The total capitalization was 12.9% at the end of the second quarter of 2014 compared to 13.4% at the end of 2013. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2014 was 39% compared with 38.6% for the second quarter of 2013. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of 39% for the remainder of 2014. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : (Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : You mentioned wanting to achieve double-digit market share. So I was wondering if you could comment on where you think you might be now and maybe roughly how long it would take you to sort of achieve that goal? David Congdon : At this time, Allison, depending on what you use for denominator, whether we're in $30 billion to $34 billion industry or a $50 billion industry, we're somewhere in the 6% to 8% market share range now. And growing into double-digits is in our five to 10-year timeframe. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : And then, David, I think it was you who mentioned that there was, or maybe it was Earl, that you guys saw some productivity pressures during the quarter, just given that the volume or tonnage growth was so strong. Could you maybe expand upon that a little bit and maybe talk about some of the metrics during the quarter? Wes Frye : Productivity, actually we had some improvements on line haul. Where we had a little bit of deterioration in productivity is in the platform and in the P&D, mostly in the platform. But we had to add roughly about 12% more people on the docks. And the training on that is three to nine months before they become efficient with how we do things, so to speak. So we have quite a bit of training pressure. And we attribute some of that reduction in that training. With a 50% increase in tonnage, we expect some productivity enhancement. And also during that training, maintaining a 99% on-time service with 0.26 claims ratio we think is very amiable from our management group and our workers to be able to accomplish that. Operator : Next from Wolfe Research, we'll go to Scott Group. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : So Wes, in terms of the pricing guidance, we saw an acceleration in pricing in the second quarter. Looks like you're talking about a deceleration in yields net of fuel in the third quarter. Is it just mix? Is it the tougher comp with the GRI? David Congdon : It's a couple of things. One obviously is the tougher comp with the GRI that happened in May and last year was in July. So that goes full circle once we get to the third quarter. We still have weight per shipments that we expect to maybe a little bit in line with the second quarter. So we still have that as well as reduced length of haul. But the second quarter was an easier comparison on yields, but keep in mind that yield guidance of 2% to 2.5% is just that, 2% to 2.5% on yield. From a pricing standpoint, including the impact of that increased weight per shipment and decreased length of haul, we still thing we're pricing 3% or better, which I think is still in this economy is very comparable. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : What we're hearing from some of the other guys that underlying contractual pricing is accelerating. Are you seeing that? David Congdon : Well, we consistently applied reasonable and fair and equitable pricing to our contractual business all along. So we'll continue to do that consistently. I'm not sure whether the rest of the industry stands on that and whether they're trying to recover more than what we need to because of our consistency of pricing discipline. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : And then just a follow-up on the market share targets, it seems like that's implying some sort of expectation for maintaining a low double-digit plus topline rate the next five or so years. Is that kind of the way you guys are thinking about the business? And if that's right, is this level of CapEx we should expect going forward? Does this go up from here? How are you thinking about that? David Congdon : Obviously we expect our market share continually to increase and to double-digit at some timeframe. Whether that can be three to five years or longer would depend somewhat on macro in line with other factors. But we don't expect it to stay at 8 for five years and then all of a sudden go to 10. We expect it consistently to increase as we have already demonstrated over the last few years. From a CapEx standpoint, obviously we'll stay on a very reasonable replacement cycle for our equipment and spend CapEx to the extent that we maintain our average age on that point. We don't really address how much of our CapEx going forward would grow. Obviously that will depend on what that growth is. But we expect our CapEx to be meaningful as we continue to grow our service and our network. We do expect our CapEx as a percent of revenue as we continue to grow our network to decline in the years to come. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : To get to double-digit market share, you need to grow your topline, grow to mid double-digit annually. Do you think that that's a sustainable run rate is what you're saying? David Congdon : We do, yeah. Operator : Next we'll hear from Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : So, Wes, I want to chat little bit on OR. Fantastic OR in the quarter. Now we usually model you sequentially. We look at seasonality. And if I do that here, I get another record for the third quarter. So are there factors in the third quarter you want to caution me against getting too bullish on the third quarter because of things we got to think about? Wes Frye : One thing that didn't affect year-over-year because it's in both quarters is we did have gains on the sale of real estate in the second quarter that was about half operating point. And we had that same in the second quarter of last year. So year-over-year, that is comparable. But sequentially, we don't expect any material gains on sale of real estate in the third quarter. So that's one thing sequentially that you need to consider. We did give our wage increases in September 1, which we plan to this year. So that's another thing to consider in the third quarter compared to second quarter. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : Is the wage increase larger than normal, or is it just sort of in line with historical averages, because otherwise you'd think the sequential change would always have that? Wes Frye : Yeah, we haven't discussed at this point what that wage increase will be. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : And then, Wes, when we look at this sort of tonnage growth and we look at what's going on overall in the marketplace, trucking, even affecting rail, things are getting tight. So do you feel like the cost inflation you're going to experience is going to accelerate going forward? Wes Frye : When you say cost inflation, what do you mean, because 67% of our cost is our own people? As you know, we use very little purchase transportation. And the amount of purchase transportation you see on the release includes some of our non-LTL drayage operations. So the purchase transportation specifically for LTL is very small. And so we don't expect a lot of inflation on that. The inflation on our own cost lies in the own wage increases that we get and then additional cost of equipment, et cetera. And of course the cost of fuel is passed through fuel surcharges. Operator : We'll move next to Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Chris Wetherbee - Citi: Maybe just a question on the dockworkers, you talked about increasing, I think, 12% is what you said for folks on the docks. You think about the third quarter and the growth that you're getting in tonnage and you're seeing that pick up 17% to 18%, is there going to be incremental hiring that we can expect in the third quarter and maybe a little bit of productivity expense that goes along with that? I guess I'm just trying to make sure I understand sort of how the staffing levels look like relative to the third quarter volumes. Wes Frye : Yeah, sequentially the third quarter from a tonnage standpoint, we do expect it to be higher than the second. And of course you can pretty much calculate that yourself based on the guidance that we gave. So I would suspect there would be some additional hiring in the third quarter, probably not as much hiring that we had in the second quarter compared to the first. But as I had also mentioned, if you recall, just the training in the second quarter still has some legs going into the third quarter. It takes 60 to 90 days to get the new employees to be efficient. So that would still affect somewhat the third quarter. And then we'll hiring additional people also in the third quarter. Chris Wetherbee - Citi: Thinking about the balance sheet a little bit, debt to capitalization seems to be roughly the lowest level we've seen in quite some time. I guess as you think about the improved profitability of the business, the cash flow generation, how do you think about that? Is there anything that you might want to do differently as far as deployment of cash flow? Obviously, CapEx needs are going to be there as you continue to foster that growth. But just thinking about that, whether you buy back, dividends, anything else we can be thinking about? Wes Frye : Yeah, we get asked that question and we continue to evaluate some return to the stockholders in terms of either dividends or stock repurchase. We're leaning toward stock repurchase. And so we'll discuss that and evaluate that continually as our cash flow and our debt to EBITDA continues to decline. So we'll continue to evaluate those alternatives from the investor standpoint. Operator : Moving on to Deutsche Bank's Rob Salmon. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : If I'm looking at the ancillary or the non-LTL revenue, it looks like that growth rate accelerated in the second quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what's driving that growth rate? The growth in kind of the non-LTL services, it looks like backing into something around $19 million or about 18% growth in the quarter. David Congdon : The non-LTL, most of that is our drayage operation, and we've had some good success in growing that in the quarter. So that's most of it. Also included is also truckload brokerage, which has had some success as well our global reporting. There's the three segments on that. They're still very small relative to our total, but we have had meaningful growth in that. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : And then in terms of the pay increase, Wes, that you alluded to, do you think it has to be more or less than kind of historical and how should we be thinking about your line haul expense, given some of the challenges that some competitors have noted as well as the tough driver environment in truckload? Wes Frye : Well, we have not announced our pay increases yet, and we don't want to do it over this conference call as to what we're planning on doing there. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : It was just related to drivers. I know you guys had kind of called out toward the end of last year some headwinds that you had experienced with regard to the hours of service. Certainly what we're seeing truckload driver pay inflation significant right now. Are you guys in the line haul side of the business needing to make any adjustments there? Wes Frye : No, not really. Our road drivers are very well paid, especially as it compares to truckload drivers. So our turnover is very well and we've had pretty good success in hiring drivers. As our business ramped up this year, finding road drivers was a little tougher than P&D drivers. It was a little bit restrained, but we got through and gotten through the year so far and maintained our 99% on-time service. Operator : We'll go next to David Ross of Stifel. David Ross - Stifel: To continue on the driver pay theme, do you have incentives for your drivers on top of base wages whether it be for fuel efficiency or picking up new business? David Congdon : Really it's a safety incentive for driving accident-free. David Ross - Stifel: Okay. But nothing on the fuel side? David Congdon : No, just the incentive to do better, so that we can give a good raise. David Ross - Stifel: And then, Wes, could you comment a little bit on the new IT platform. You mentioned on the fourth quarter call that that was going to be rolled out over the next year or two. Is that still on track? Any update on the progress there would be great. David Congdon : Dave, the IT modernization efforts are well underway right now, with examining numerous of our operating systems. We've got 4.5 year, 5 year process in three major phases, looking at all of our systems and converting to new hardware platform with Oracle. So it's well underway. Operator : We'll go to Thomas Kim of Goldman Sachs. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs : As you think about growing your share, and I can appreciate a lot of your growth has been organic and you obviously have done very well with that, I'm wondering whether you're considering about or whether you need to consider diversifying into other component businesses to sustain that long-term growth that you are anticipating? David Congdon : For the time being, we are successfully winning market share with the business model that we're under. And we think that we should continue staying focused on that, and that will be the best return on our invested capital to do so. However, we always keep our eyes open for diversification opportunities as they may arise and also for potential acquisitions within the various spaces that we currently occupy. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs : And just on that last comment, what would be the framework in which you would deem be to sort worthy of considering M&A? Earl Congdon : We're not real excited about acquisition right now for the reason David stated. We're protecting our service levels, because that's why we're as successful as we are. And acquisition has really got to be tempting and we look at them all the time. But we almost always turn them down. So it's not a major thing for us right now because of the fact that we're so successful doing what we do. If we see that slowing down, we'll get more interested in acquisitions, I expect. But as of now, we're just trying to grow organically and I think we're pretty successful at it. David Congdon : As we look at asset-light type acquisitions and companies of any size, it appears to us that that marketplace has overpriced a lot of these companies. They're sort of the multiples of EBITDA that companies are paying and the private equity funds are paying. They tend to price us out of the market. And we're also a bit constrained by our own success. The fact that we're earning greater than 15% return on invested capital, if we plug that expectation into an acquisition, we might only come up with three to four times EBITDA, and people are paying to eight to 10 times EBITDA. So we tend to price ourselves out of the market because of our own success. Operator : KeyBanc Capital Markets' Todd Fowler has our next question. Todd Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets : David, I think in the past, you talked about the business is growing at some sort of multiple of where industrial production is or some other economic metric. And it feels like that the last couple of quarters, the growth rate has been faster than that. And I'm curious if you can comment as to why you think that is? Is that success with your 3PL partners? Is it a shift towards e-commerce and where you are positioned with the next-day shipments? I'm just kind of curious kind of your view on the growth rates relative to where you've been historically. David Congdon : Todd, I really believe it's just a matter of our overall total service products that we're offering to anywhere from mom and pop shippers to large shippers where we have a direct relationship, to our relationships with our 3PLs. We just have a darn good service product that sells. And we're just playing on and winning market share. Todd Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets : But you've had a darn good service product for long time. And so I guess I'm trying to get a sense of if there is something that you're seeing in the market that's different now, or why people are realizing that more now than what they were, even if you look at the growth rates a year ago? David Congdon : I think the second quarter, we had such a strong tonnage growth because of, I think, the macro was behaving a little more appropriately. We've seen the initial indications of GDP in the second quarter being as much as 4% compared to down 2% in the first quarter. So I think we're all kind of flirting along with that. It remains to be seen what'll happen in the second half. But for sure that's part of the second quarter in addition to our market share. I think in the first quarter, we had a strong growth despite the weather, because we simply will provide you service and provide you coverage even in those areas that we're negatively impacted by weather. We were still running our equipment safely obviously to service our customers. Todd Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets : This is kind of a damned if you do, damned if you don't type question. But when you look at the growth rates, is there ever a point where you say growing in the high-teens is too much and we want to moderate the growth to make sure that we've got the employees and we've got the efficiencies and those sorts of things in place? Or do you feel that the business is positioned that it can grow at the high-teens and continue to produce results like you had this quarter? David Congdon : Today our operating people darn sure have sweat on their brow living with the growth rates that we have been sustaining over this last year especially. So I'm really proud of our management team and all of our service center managers, all of our drivers and dock workers and all who are delivering this superior service product. And we've had our nose to the groundstone. Our people have really come through and done a great job. Operator : We'll hear next from Tom Albrecht of BB&T. Tom Albrecht - BB&T: Wes, I wanted to ask you, on miscellaneous expenses, it was $1.8 million versus $17,000. What was in that? Was that the deferred comp? It seems like that used to be down below the line? Wes Frye : A couple of things. Last year, we had some positive results and some of our cost was lower than normal. This year, fortunately it returns back to normal. The other thing is we've discussed modernization and while most of our modernization expense will be capitalized, accounting principles dictate that some of it has to be expensed. And some of that increase is due to the cost that we are realizing from our modernization efforts going forward. Tom Albrecht - BB&T: When you talk about other expenses, what's an example of other, not related to the modernization? Wes Frye : What the other thing is in there is the gains of sale, but that's comparable. There was a favorable impact last year, so an easier comparison, and the effects with some of our modernization in there this year. Tom Albrecht - BB&T: So let me ask you kind of a bigger picture question then. Your weight per shipment continues to go up. And when we look at the public companies, some are up, some are down. Are there certain days of the week that make more sense to play in the truckload spot market, or is it geographical? Can you just talk about the philosophy of when that occurs versus maybe part of your weight per shipment just coming from customers doing better? Wes Frye : We're still growing in the larger contractual business, which has a weight per shipment that is more like 1,700 pound or even a little more. So just mathematically as we continue to take on large contractual whether it be 3PLs or direct, your weight per shipment is going to continue to go higher. Also in up economies, you're shipping more widgets. So if the economy is behaving well, we can expect weight per shipment to be up that way as well. From a truckload standpoint, we do use truckload in some cases, and we call it spot quotes, but we manage that very closely. Obviously our costs are related to providing LTL service and a truckload rate per mile, call it $1.55, just doesn't compensate us for the heavy and extensive network that we have to support. So we really don't see getting into truckload on the spot basis measurably. And if we do, we price it such that we do have a pretty good margin on it. But that isn't what we would expect to increase our weight per shipment measurably going forward. Tom Albrecht - BB&T: In general though, have you seen a greater rate of growth with shipments over 5,000 and maybe even 10,000 pounds? Wes Frye : Not really. In shipments, obviously it's flat to down. If the revenue is up in the case, it's because we're charging to compensate us for taking on that truckload. And of course truckload brokerage is one of our value-added services that if our customers need that service, we will take into the truckload brokerage and get him the resources from that side. Tom Albrecht - BB&T: And then lastly, on the fuel, you've commented on fuel management buying practices. Was there also an element with just better MPG for newer equipment? David Congdon : We've had a continuous improvement in MPG really going back since 2010. And it's been better managing fuel mileage down to the driver level and the replacement cycle with newer equipment, the installation of the skirts on the trailers, which we're 100% skirted fleet now. All of that has come into play with continuous improvement in fuel economy. Operator : Next from Cowen & Company, we'll hear from Jason Seidl. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company: Just quickly, when you look at your mix of business between sort of more local and national accounts, was there any noticeable shift in the quarter? David Congdon : There's been shifts in that for years that higher percentages of our business is in the contractual larger as opposed to what we call the smaller terra type and that's occurring within the industry and a lot of that's going to 3PLs. But on the other hand, we work very closely with 3PLs on that front as well. So it's a trend that's happening. We're doing well managing that. And so it basically just is what it is. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company: Wes, you also talked a little bit about your pay increases coming up. Are you having trouble in other areas besides maybe some drivers and hiring people maybe such as mechanics, dock workers? I'm just kind of curious how tight the labor market is for you? Wes Frye : Well, we've increased our employee in the second quarter this year over last year by 14%. And although that's been something of a challenge, we're able to do that. And so we've been successful in adding not only on the docks, but also the driver force. Operator : We'll hear now from Brad Delco of Stephens Incorporated. Brad Delco - Stephens Incorporated : Wes, it's maybe for you just real quickly. You commented that your debt to cap ratio is probably as low as it's been in at least quite some time. Where do you feel comfortable with your debt to cap ratio? If you decided to deploy some capital, what's the comfort level on that number? Wes Frye : We've had as high as 40% in large growth and we can do that, but there had to be an opportunity which we're probably not intending to do. But in the 15% to 20% we think would be good just looking at our cost of capital and looking at our capital structures a reasonable frame. Brad Delco - Stephens Incorporated : When you look at your incremental margins in the quarter, I think they were just north of 22%, very close to where your overall book of business is running. Is there any way to sort of parcel out where you think this new tonnage that's coming on? Is it more profitable than legacy business or business that's been in your model for a while? And have you changed the targets at all for your sales force in terms of what type of freight they have to bring on and what the OR is? I guess the bottomline is, is the freight that's coming on incrementally more profitable or priced differently than what you have existed in your network? Wes Frye : Brad, I'll have to say no to your question. We're seeing our tonnage growth, our revenue growth really pretty strong and uniform across the entire country. And so the entire sales force is just bringing on business, growing with existing accounts. And there are no targets to bring on to freight at lower operating ratios than we historically have. In fact, our pricing is really the same. We haven't changed that at all over the last while. And so it's just across the board. Operator : And gentlemen, it appears we have no further questions at this time. Mr. Earl Congdon, I would like to turn the conference back over to you for closing remarks. Earl Congdon : Guys, as always, thank you all for your participation and those excellent questions today. We appreciate your support for Old Dominion. And please give us a call if you have any further questions. So thank you and good day. Operator : And again, that does conclude today's conference and we thank you all for joining us.",

[Operator Instructions] Thanks for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's Executive Chairman, Mr. Earl Congdon. Please go ahead, sir. Earl E. Congdon: Good morning. Thanks for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. With me this morning are David Congdon, Old Dominion's President and CEO; and Wes Frye, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. We are pleased to report that Old Dominion had another quarter of strong profitable growth. The comparable quarter revenue increasing over 20% and earnings per share growing 28.6% to $0.90 per diluted share. Our revenue earnings per share and tonnage set quarterly reference for us and the rate of growth has accelerated for each quarter throughout the year. We continue to gain market share by providing a superior customer experience while also refining our business model primarily through the development of new services and the application of new technologies. We have carved out a unique position in the LTL industry by consistently and successfully executing on school [ph], business, principles and strategies. Our long-term record of profitable growth drivers would not be possible without the high-quality and tremendous dedication of our employees. Recognizing the performance of our team today, I'll mention our ongoing commitment to consist -- to continuous investment in equipment and infrastructure as well as continuous education and training of our employees. We are investing in our people and providing them the tools and the resources they need to perform their jobs effectively is a significant cost for business, but it is absolutely essential to creating the quality organization that we enjoy today. We're committed to continuing these investments necessary to deliver superior service, which will continue to drive our long-term growth in earnings and shareholder value, and thank you for joining our call today. And now here's David Congdon. David S. Congdon: Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results for 2014. Our basic business model is delivering superior service at a fair price continues to consistently drive our long-term growth. Furthermore, with favorable economic and pricing environment combined with improved density and continued focus on efficiency improvements continue to drive improvements at our operating ratio. The third quarter increase of 18.7% of LTL tons compared with the third quarter last year produced record density metrics virtually across the board. At the same time, we had a slowly expanding but positive economy that contributed to a rational pricing environment. We are pleased with the third quarter's LTL revenue per hundredweight, which increased 2.2%, excluding fuel surcharge especially considering the 2.5% increase in LTL weight per shipment and 1% decline in our average length of haul for the quarter, which negatively affect this metric. We believe this performance in lieu of management combined with our strong growth in LTL tons highlights the strength of our business model. We discussed at our last call, we continued to expand our workforce in the third quarter in response to our strong growth in LTL tonnage. We estimate that it takes 6 to 9 months for new employees to fully learn our processes and procedures and to make a positive contribution to productivity. Consequently, we continue to experience some negative pressure on our back productivity metrics. Despite this, we are pleased to have produced a 22.3% incremental margin primarily driven by the increased density and yield I've already mentioned. As we look to the end of 2014 and beyond, we believe that Old Dominion remains well-positioned to continue outperforming our industry. True to the discipline, execution and investment needed to operate our business model effectively and profitably, we believe we have created and have the ability to sustain a unique competitive position for the company and its shareholders. Thanks for being with us today, and now Wes will review our financial results for the quarter in greater detail. J. Wes Frye : Thank you, David, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue expanded to a new quarterly record of $743.6 million for the third quarter of 2014, up 20.6% and $616.5 million for the third quarter of 2013. Net earnings increased 28.6% to $0.90 per diluted share from $0.70 per diluted share. The strong growth was driven by an 18.7% increase in LTL tons comprised of a 15.8% increase in LTL shipments and a 2.5% increase in the LTL weight per shipment. Our revenue performance also reflects a 1.6% increase in revenue per hundredweight or a 2.2% increase if you exclude the effect of fuel surcharge. As David mentioned, our quarterly revenue per hundredweight was negatively impacted by increased weight per shipment and decline in average length of haul. The directional changes in weight per shipment and length of haul have been -- will now be consistent for 11 consecutive quarters reflecting the ongoing shift in our freight mix to a higher weighted contractual business and increased volume in our next day and 2 days regional lanes. For the third quarter of 2014, monthly LTL tons per day decreased sequentially by 1.1% from June -- July to June both -- an increase by 2% and 2.8% for August and September, respectively. Historically, sequential trends declined 2.5% for July, and increased by 0.5% and 3.3% for August and September, respectively. On a comparable quarter basis, LTL tons per day increased 18.8% for July, 19% for August and 18% for September. We estimate our October LTL tonnage to be up approximately 21% versus the same prior year period against the following easy comparison. For the third quarter of 2014, assuming normalized sequential trends, we expect the LTL tons per day to increase in a range of 19% to 19.5% compared with the third quarter of 2013. Monthly, year-over-year tonnage increases during the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to 2012 were 8.5% in October, 10.3% in November and 13.4% in December. We expect revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, to be in a range of 2% to 2.5% for the fourth quarter compared with the fourth quarter of last year. Old Dominion's operating ratio improved 110 basis points to an 83.0% for the third quarter from an 84.1% for the third quarter of 2013, driven primarily by our increased freight density and yield. We also continue to benefit from savings from fuel purchasing strategies and fuel efficiencies, which contributed to a 70-basis point reduction in operating supplies and expense. Capital expenditures were $93.4 million for the third quarter of 2014 and $312 million for the first 9 months of the year, and we estimate CapEx for the entirety of 2014 will total approximately $385 million, including planned expenditures of $132 million for real estate, $206 million for tractors, trailers and other equipment and $47 million for technology and other assets. We expect the sale of assets during 2014 to be approximately $20 million for a total net CapEx of approximately $365 million, and we expect to fund these expenditures primarily through operating cash flow as well as our available borrowing capacity, if necessary. Total debt to total capitalization was 11.4% at the end of the third quarter of 2014 compared with 13.4% at the end of 2013. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2014 was 37.1% compared with 36.9% for the third quarter of 2013, and we expect an effective tax rate of 38.6% for the fourth quarter of 2014. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for any questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Allison Landry with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : So the first question I had -- so consolidation has been a pretty hot topic across almost every sector in transports recently. So I just wanted to sort of get the LTL perspective on this whether or not you've seen any recent changes in your sector, and if there's any incremental opportunities you're seeing for tuck-in acquisitions. David S. Congdon: Allison, this is David. We haven't really seen any consolidation activity occurring recently, as far as acquisitions are concerned. We really don't have any on our radar as far as LTL companies or anything for that matter at this point in time. We don't need a LTL acquisition because we are already currently in all 48 states and we're successfully growing organically, so an LTL acquisition would not be important to us. Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, that's fair. That makes sense. And then as a follow-up question, so -- how would you describe your overall capacity right now from an equipment and a terminal or door [ph] perspective? And I guess, sort of what I'm trying to get at there is sort of your initial thoughts on CapEx expectations for 2015. David S. Congdon: As history have shown, Old Dominion has been perhaps the only LTL carrier to continuously invest in CapEx for real estate. So maybe we've been the best significant investor in CapEx for real estate. We have -- we keep an eye on our capacity at all times, and we have invested where we've seen where our growth has been the strongest and where our growth is projected to be the strongest. So if you look at 224 service centers across the country, you'll find some that have 30% to 50% capacity. And then, you'll find some that might have 10% or 15% capacity, and those are the ones who will probably be looking at for expanding our capital going forward. But we have not yet completed our estimates for CapEx for next year. We will plan to announce our 2015 CapEx budget on our call in -- at the latest, late January or early February. J. Wes Frye : That our fourth quarter call. David S. Congdon: Our fourth quarter call, we will announce our CapEx in '15. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : You talked a little bit about declining or just some of the productivity on the dock side. Is this a function of you having to hire just new people? Or is it a function of your tonnage growth as far outpacing the industry or a little bit of both? David S. Congdon: Well, it's a little bit of both, but we definitely had to add our warehousing. I believe that the press release indicated that we have added nearly 2,000 employees over the last year, and 800 and some odd were added just in the third quarter. So in response to this strong and accelerating tonnage growth, we've added a considerable number of warehouse office in dollars. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : So that should probably -- that pressure should probably continue at least for the fourth quarter. David S. Congdon: Yes. The number of people that we have now, once you reach your sort of peak tonnage in shipment per day in September, that carries out through October, November and all up to the week before Christmas. So we should not have to add any new people appreciably on our -- during the rest of this year, and we should be good with our headcount going into the first quarter of next year. So we should -- we anticipate getting some of that productivity lost back as the people get their feet on the ground and get up to maximum productivity. It takes -- today, with all the technology that we have on our docks and methods of operation on the dock and loading trailers, we believe it takes 6 to 9 months for a dock worker to get to a productive and to start making any contribution toward improved productivity. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : All right, that's actually a very helpful color. I guess, a follow-up on, David, the rest of the industry has just started doing another round of economic [ph] increases, and I do realize that you guys historically have done it a little bit later than your peers. Do you think the market can handle this? Do you think we're going a little bit too much to the low with the GRI customers? I'd love to hear thoughts. David S. Congdon: Well, it will be interesting to see how this all shakes out. I was frankly a little surprised how early some of the other carriers [ph] came out with the GRI. It was a surprise to all of us at management, along David, that, that happened. But we have accurate company [ph] specific decision that they made. We are still in the process of steadying our cost and our numbers and have not yet determined when or how much rate increase we plan to take this year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : And I'm -- I wanted to just follow-up on this whole idea of productivity here in the fourth quarter. Maybe, Wes, when you think about the sequential change, you talked about it from a tonnage standpoint. We like to think about it on the OR basis. Is there anything in a cost structure that makes looking at sequential changes in OR fourth quarter or third not useful this time around? J. Wes Frye : Well, obviously, we're not giving guidance for the fourth quarter of any incremental margins or any margins at all. But I guess, we have had an incremental margins above 20% for every quarter this year, and so we all can say as long as the pricing bubble remains stable and once the economic -- the macro is in a regional position, and we still have, I think, the ability to improve our operations and efficiency through, as David mentioned in the fourth quarter, we should see some productivity improvement. We should certainly be out of our -- cap at the high-end of our range of 15% of 20% given those conditions. William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Yes. Okay. And when you look at what's going on with your tonnage growth, I assume that some of what we see going on with the rails, of course, with the truckload companies as well with their capacity being as tight as it is, and with the aggressiveness we're seeing from some peers on pricing efforts that all of this is combining to driving some pretty terrific tonnage growth rate for you. How long do you think this is sustainable? I know that's tough to sort of answer, and I know you don't give a guidance. But I would assume next year, as we think about it, we should see slower tonnage growth. But I don't know what your thoughts are. It would be helpful to hear your perspective. David S. Congdon: So it's for sure that we are seeing some spillover, but what we're doing strategically and to maintain our high -- very high levels of customer service especially in the Pacific Northwest where, as you know, the rail service is not good. And even in some other lanes, we are actually putting on our own drivers and equipment. So we're investing. In fact, we've already invested $10 million to $15 million in additional tractors, and additional trailers and additional drivers, replacing the rail service with our own equipment. And I don't know anyone else is actually going to that investment to do that and we -- because what's important to us is to maintain the high levels of customer service. And you saw that our CapEx went up somewhat in the -- from our last guidance, and that will be one of the reasons is just making sure that we are properly invested to maintain high level of customer service. J. Wes Frye : And Bill, I have a little bit more than this. Clearly, there has been an increase in demand for trucking services in -- across all sectors of transportation with the intermodal, truckload, there's been increases with -- of demand for the LTL. I'm curious as well, and those clearly a -- are a lot of constraints on growing capacity. The capital side of it is very intense. The driver shortage is real. The cost of doing business, the taxes, our regulation, all of that is putting a damper on growth and capacity. So I believe that we'll just wait for -- and this is not something that's going to go away next year or the next year. I'm thinking a long-term cap on capacity growth and increased demand. So to go with that probably means is that it's going to probably keep a new [ph] management and then branching -- pretty do it [ph] for the trucking industry. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I wanted to ask a question just sort on driver and pay and potential sort of unionization threats that we're seeing at some of the other LTL nonunionzed LTL carriers in the space. Just want to get your sense on just sort of maybe how you see the driver wage inflation going forward. You'd obviously done a lot of hiring, been very successful getting bodies into the business. Just kind of curious about your thoughts, not just for the fourth quarter but also maybe for 2015. David S. Congdon: Chris, among the LTL carriers, I think, Old Dominion has a very, very competitive, if not on the high-end of wages and benefits. And then, so we're in -- when compared with the truckload industry, we're significantly higher with that industry. Also, our wage inflation is going to be roughly what we guided this year, which is about, on the average wage, it was... J. Wes Frye : 2.5%. David S. Congdon: About 3.5% or so. So it's not a significant upside in terms of cost probably in this traffic [ph]. I think you could see the biggest amount of wage inflations can be on the truckload industry. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, okay. That's helpful color, appreciate it. And just a quick follow-up just sort of looking at the line items on the expense side. Just curious, it looks like miscellaneous expense kind of jumped up a little bit higher than our number. I noticed 1 point but just kind of curious what your thoughts for there. Is there something a little bit more isolated for the third quarter? That maybe a sort of way to think about things going forward. David S. Congdon: Yes. I guess, we did have a few things. We had some goods -- that losses that were settled [ph] that went into the quarter that went into that number. Another thing is it included some of our modernization cost, the consultants that are in that number. So those are the 2 other costs that predominantly make up that increase. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Can you just give us a rough sense of maybe what the lawsuit piece of that was? Or maybe what the ongoing piece might be for the modernization? David S. Congdon: We prefer not to give any details on that. In terms of the overall company, it's fairly immaterial. Operator : We'll take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC: So I wanted to just follow-up on the tonnage question of how sustainable this is, and where can we go from here. Maybe just from your perspective, you guys have talked about getting to a double-digit market share target over a few years. Do you think that happens? Is that, in your mind, not going to happen sooner than you would have thought as -- can you -- I guess, I'm asking, can you maintain that's kind of low teens? Your upper teens' 20% now, but do you think low teens is a sustainable run rate for tonnage going forward? David S. Congdon: Well, I think, when we convinced that -- we gave that guidance, of course, and so obviously, we believe that it is. The time frame, we don't give because of our other influences that maybe the macro et cetera, but obviously, we think that we can get into those low teens. And depending on how quickly that is will depend upon the macro, the industry itself, in particular with consolidation. But we think, from our standpoint, that we'll continue to take appropriate market share going forward. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay. And historically, I think, with the higher fuel is actually a good thing for LTLs from an earnings perspective and in other fuel maybe not so much. Do you think that thought still applies today? David S. Congdon: Well, we manage our -- I mean, today without the fuel surcharge, as we continuously indicate, we don't depend on fuel surcharge to improve our performance one way or another, and what we do would depend on is just the efficiency and not only how we buy fuel but how we operate our equipment, and we're extremely efficient. So much of our improvement is coming from the efficiencies with the -- of our fuel strategies, and whether it has nothing directly to do with fuel surcharges. But right now, we were still seeing very good incremental margins, and fuel surcharges have been relatively flat. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brad Delco with Stephens. A. Brad Delco - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Wes, just wanted to touch base on that wage inflation pressure. When I look at your salaries, wages and benefits in the quarter, it was up 19%. You said you lost a little bit of dock worker productivity. Your tonnage was up close to 19%, but you also said you had about 3.5% inflation. How do we reconcile that? I guess, where are you seeing improved productivity? Or how are you able to keep your salaries, wages and benefits essentially below what you would assume? J. Wes Frye : So Brad, obviously, salary, wages and benefits includes the whole company, including salaries. So we've lost some productivity on the direct labor side, and that would indicate that in our wages. But most of the improvement in our wage category is coming from the fact that our benefits is in pretty good shape. And also, the salaries -- those fixed salaries, we're getting some leverage in the [ph] growth on that. So that -- those 2 things are causing that wage and salary benefit number to drop. A. Brad Delco - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Got you. And then, is there any way you can sort of quantify in dollars what the dock worker productivity loss was? J. Wes Frye : There is a way, we just don't want to discuss that detail. A. Brad Delco - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Got you. It makes sense. And then maybe my last one looks to maybe help me kind of back me on a little bit. But the 2,000 workers or the 800 and change that you added in the quarter. What's your total dock workforce number? And can you kind of give us an idea what kind of percentage increase you had in that workforce? J. Wes Frye : Well, we had about a 23% increase of -- we had about a 23% increase in our dock employees since the beginning of the year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : You've got a lot of thoughts in terms of entering into ancillary services, which kind of add-ons to the Old Dominion value that you're offering the customers. And one of your competitors has been talking a little bit about their foray in their last mile and kind of a derivative play on e-commerce. Could you give us a sense to what extent is the last mile a portion of what Old Dominion does today? And how do guys are thinking about capitalizing on the growth in e-commerce longer term? David S. Congdon: If we're referring to last mile as home deliveries, it is not a large focus at Old Dominion. Residential deliveries are probably one of the most costly type of deliveries we operate. And so -- and also, if you're talking about e-commerce and people buying things off the Internet and taking them to their homes, you're talking primarily about small parcel and package and things like that, that are just not suitable in an LTL truck line, unless you have to -- -- unless you make an investment in a whole new period of panel [ph] vans and things like that. And rather try to compete with the postal service, and FedEx and UPS. So it's not a big focus for us in the future. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : That's such great color, David. It's just one of your private LTL competitors are saying that last mile is about 10% of their other shipments this year, which frankly, it surprised me. I guess they're using a little bit more on the third party PT for that delivery. But I guess, kind of switching gears, could you give us a little bit of an update with regard to the developments within Washington? Any sort of thoughts or what you're hearing from your contacts in Washington about potentially getting pup [ph] trailers as well as what the -- if there's any change to the hours of service with regards to the 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. requirement kind of doing lights off to get the restart, and what that would mean if you got it. David S. Congdon: Okay. We -- I'll start with the 33 foot trailers. I believe we're making some headway. There is a coalition of the LTL carriers plus American Trucking Association focused on this matter. And yet, a big part of that is this the -- it's a perception game. We clearly believe that 33 foot trailers are safe. They are certainly fuel-efficient, they offer 18% additional of accrued [ph] maneuverability. Is it there? We're not asking for any increase in gross weight limit of 80,000 pounds, and we believe we have a good chance of getting that through. With that said, the other key thing is a highway deal, and we're really anticipating a long-term highway deal to go through the floors of Congress for approval sometime in the spring -- by the spring because the current highway [indiscernible] deal, I believe it ends by the 1st of May or somewhere of whereabouts. And so hopefully, we will have the language in that bill to include the allowance of 32 and 33-foot trailers. We have -- on the issue of the hours of service, the 2 things we work on there, and one is the -- looking at the restart provision, this from our aspect, in our company, we think that it's still a couple of things. One, it's causing us to have to add a couple of hundred additional drivers to cover work that rural drivers and city drivers will be performing on the weekends to be able to be able to keep our freight moving through the system. It's also the raising -- we're gaining some extra work because they could restart the clock after an extra weekend trip and go back to work on Monday, but it's a reduced with compensation. But they're able to make those certain drivers have lost 10% to 15% of their compensation as -- and it's caused us to have to add some additional tractors as well. So we certainly want to see that restart provision changed. The other side of it is the split [indiscernible] provisions. I mean, with distinct difference between single drivers using a restart and team of drivers having a split [indiscernible], we run primarily on teams across the country that would use that split seat [indiscernible] provision, and we will see it go back to where we can allow that to take 5 hours on, 5 hours off, 5 hours on, 5 hours off. Right now, they happen to be behind the wheel for 10 hours now, they've only been up for 10 hours. So it's a -- we've been operating my leg for a number of years but it's not the most ideal way. So hopefully, we can get those push or get those provisions changed back. Operator : We'll take our next question from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Wes, you mentioned earlier in your prepared remarks that you've seen an increase in your contractual base business. Can you provide a little more color on that comment, whether it's a contract durations increasing, the overall percentage of growth in your multiyear contracts versus the transactional side? J. Wes Frye : Overall -- yes, overall, we finished in the quarter was as we disclosed is about 21%, and we saw an increase in revenue for contractual business for the quarter up 24%. And so that's obviously -- and if you know, Tom, or maybe you don't know, but the rate per shipment for that contractual business, it is higher than it is for our other business. It's about 16 -- about almost 1,700 pounds compared to a tariff-tied [ph] business, it's only about 1,200 pounds. So mathematically, you can see that is one reason why we have seen an increase in our weight per shipment. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Absolutely. And then, just with regard to the overall pricing, obviously, doesn't mention the fact that you're talking about the dampening way, the head mining of [indiscernible]. Can you give us a sense of what your pricing would look like on an apples-to-apples basis? J. Wes Frye : Well, we don't have an algorithm for pricing specifically, but we do kind of look at if the weight per shipment and the length of haul were the same between the quarters. Just those 2 variables being fixed, we recorded a 2.2% increase. It would have been around 3.2% to 3.5% if those 2 numbers were the same in both quarters. So that's just the factor on just those 2 variables that, as you know, there is many other variables. And that still doesn't really indicate price. It just indicates yield. And the yield certainly would have been higher, had those 2 metrics been the same in both quarters. Operator : We'll take our next question from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Clark Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : David, I was hoping kind of high-level you can give us some sense of where you would classify the tonnage growth coming from -- I don't want to give you options because I think you'll say yes to all of the above. But I mean, is it that the 3PL channel? Do you think it's truckload? I mean, if you can just kind of give us a sense of where you really think that -- areas where you're seeing the biggest tonnage growth. David S. Congdon: Tonnage growth is really coming from all the above. We have 9 regions that we look at across the country, and we're seeing growth in revenue anywhere from 17% on the low-end to 26% on the high-end. And you tend to see a little bit stronger growth across the top half in the country, and the West Coast right now is good. And it's a little slower through the Gulf Coast region, South and Mid-south regions, but they're not appreciably slow. And we have a relatively strong growth in every service centers. So tonnage is coming across the board in every single location from a variety of sources. Todd Clark Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : And to the last caller's question, I mean, the increase that you're seeing in the contractual side, what do you attribute that to? And what's driving that sort of increase this year versus prior years? David S. Congdon: Well, the contractual is primarily with the largest accounts, and I think these largest accounts recognize that OD has depth and breath of services and coverage, and we're able to serve them in so many different ways, all with one company, and with top-of-the-line technology, and the best in service and the lowest claims ratio. And so we make it easy for them to do business for us, and so we're seeing we have large accounts just as [indiscernible] as with any accounts, but still trying in [indiscernible] and then some more business. And then they rally some more business and, they're just tending to grow with these larger accounts. Todd Clark Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. I guess I just gave you a free commercial on that one. But the follow-up that I had was the holiday impact in the fourth quarter this year, how do you think about that from an operational standpoint with where holidays falls as a positive or negative from an operational standpoint this year? David S. Congdon: The holiday business had -- has pretty much moved by now in terms of stocking the shelves. There'll be a continuous stocking through the fall, but retail for us only comprises about 20% to 25% of our business. So it's not something where we used together. It used to be 40%, 45% of our business, and it caused quite a level of freight in the prior to Christmas. So we're a lot smoother this day and age with only 20%, 25% in the retail or so. It's a -- what we see now in terms of tonnage and the growth we're seeing, it's -- we got retail in there, but we got to anticipate any major surge for the rest of the year in that category. Todd Clark Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : But with the 2016 on a Friday, does that count for a half-day for you guys or a full-day from a cost standpoint? David S. Congdon: Somewhere between a half- and a full-day. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Ross with Stifel. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : The density-based pricing is being rolled out -- at least one of your competitors as an option for customers. Given your use of dimensioners and your view of the freight, is that something that you're also offering customers? And any other thoughts you have on density-based pricing? David S. Congdon: We have had a density-based tariff in place for a number of years, at least 5 or maybe 8 to 10 years. So we haven't seen a lot of demand, but honestly, for folks to use it, more selling with our global customers, bringing product here and it's a density-based pricing coming from a foreign country in the U.S. And that it may be able to use our density carrier to price from door-to-door. So we've had one, and we're from -- it's out there. We had to have a tariff with that. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tom Albrecht with BB&T. Thomas S. Albrecht - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Really, most of my questions have been answered. But while I got you, I want to make sure I heard something right. The sequential tonnage changes in July, Wes, did you say that was off 0.5%? J. Wes Frye : It was 0.5% through the -- to the positive. It's typically down, that's not us [ph]. It was typically down 2.5% and this year, it was only down 1.1%. That was July from June. Yes, July from June. Thomas S. Albrecht - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Right. Okay. All right. And then, I asked this with someone else earlier, but on the GRI, the whole philosophy there. Wall Street loves to see these headlines. But I just wonder if it doesn't undercut your relationships for some small- and mid-sized shippers a little bit, pushing them more directly to 3PLs. What is your view on GRIs in that respect? David S. Congdon: Well, as our cost of doing business continues to rise, we need to take rate increases of both the GRI as well as contractual increases. I think that the advanced timing of the GRIs that were announced, thus far, perhaps is undercutting the relationships a little bit at. It's those sort of things that will [indiscernible] it's surprised how soon some of the other carriers have come out with another GRI. J. Wes Frye : Well, typically, the GRIs tend to get discounted away during the year. We don't know that anecdotally whether that's the case this year, and then we're just trying to replenish this. Is that the GRIs that were implemented in March or April whenever that was. Does that imply that those GRIs were already discounted away? We won't know. We only think -- to me, it'll be much wiser just to hold on to what you have. And of course, if you compound the 4% or the 5% and -- earlier in the year and the 5% now, that's over a 12-month period of compounded to 10% or more. And yes, I think that could have the 10% to hasten their transition to a logistics company, and that's been happening for several years. But for us, we price a smaller company just like we price a larger company. At least we look at the profitability and based the rates accordingly. So -- and we'll do the same with the GRI this year -- is to evaluate the profitability of that as we continue to evaluate. Thomas S. Albrecht - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Well, if they couldn't hold on to GRIs this year, then other folks have problems, but my own soapbox. But let me just expand the whole 3PL then. I think you're very disciplined in how you price to the 3PLs, but is there a part of that business that's more or less blanket pricing as opposed to really specific to the customers the 3PL is representing? David S. Congdon: We have very little on a blanket price. Our philosophy has always been to look at each individual account that our 3PL manages and to evaluate that on account based on what's selling there and the productivity -- I mean, the profitability of that specific account. And for us to put your account where the customer goes direct, then we look at the characteristics and then generate a price based on a desired operating ratio. It's the same, same, same with the 3PL venture to us. You got to a differentiate. So we'll manage on that specific account. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Campbell with Thompson, Davis & Company. David Pearce Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Company: I just wanted to ask, we all are -- I mean, it looks like March is going to be very strong. Demand is going to be very strong. Tonnage is going to be up substantially. You've added a lot of employees. What would happen next year if the tonnage market for whatever reason didn't increase as much as your buoys [ph] were up? Would you think that the yields would go down on tonnage? Is that how you'd maintain the growth? Or just what would happen? David S. Congdon: We manage our business day-by-day and week-by-week, and we have a really good handle on our label compared with the business levels. And so if things toughen up [ph], we will adjust our labor accordingly. So I guess, that's the answer. But as we've mentioned earlier, we've lost some productivity because of the new employees are still learning our systems and our processes and our methodologies, and we anticipate getting some improvement in productivity going forward. So if the tonnage did not increase, we should have an improvement in productivity because if we don't add any people that will -- the people we have, in 6 to 9 months, will become more and more and more productive. David Pearce Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Company: The second question is what -- how is your expedited business in the third quarter and cottage [ph] business? David S. Congdon: The expedited and the cottage [ph] is doing just fine. David Pearce Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Company: You mean, it's growing as fast as the rest of the business? David S. Congdon: Yes. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I'm just wondering as you've gone through 2014 tonnage growth and the LTL business had accelerated, you've had success penetrating the national accounts. I'm just wondering what effect it does have on the previous questions. Of some of the ancillary businesses that you've targeted for growth longer term. I mean, does that -- the opportunity that's developed on the LTL side, allow you to reduce some of the emphasis that you might have on the non-LTL business and just go capture this LTL share opportunity while it's immediately in front of you? Or as you penetrated some of these national accounts, do you find them concerned about capacity? And therefore, more amenable to broadening the sales effort beyond just LTL? J. Wes Frye : Well it's not mutually exclusive, Ben. We can certainly focus our strategy on both at the same time as far as capital. As David mentioned earlier, we are one of the few LTL carriers and maybe the only one that's actually invested in capacity, at least on the network side. So -- and we will -- we continue to do that going forward because we expect to continue to take market share, and we'll need capacity to be able to do that. And one of the reasons we, in fact, are taking market share is we have invested in capacity, we have the equipment, we have the drivers and we have the real estate to be able to handle the additional market share. And we'll continue to do that. Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : So the conclusion is the acceleration in LTL volume growth here year-to-date has not changed your focus on developing those non-LTL services? J. Wes Frye : No, not at all. We're -- we focus on all of the guided [ph] value-added services, alongside of our LTL services, and we do find that these larger contractual accounts have some businesses in all categories. And that's what they like about it is that we can serve all of these different non-LTL that specialized services while we serve the LTL as well, along with the grand corporate headquarters and that management team. Operator : And with no further questions, I'd like to turn the call back to Earl Congdon for any additional or closing remarks. Earl E. Congdon: Ladies and gentlemen, as we thank you for your participation today. We enjoyed your questions, and thank you for your support of Old Dominion. If you have any further questions, give us a call, and we'll try to answer them. Thank you again, and good day. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to the company's Executive Chairman, Mr. Earl Congdon. Please go ahead, sir. Earl E. Congdon: Good morning. Thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter conference call. With me this morning are David Congdon, Old Dominion's President and CEO; and Wes Frye, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion completed 2014 with its strongest quarterly performance of the year, marking the third consecutive quarter in which the year-over-year growth in rate from revenues, tonnage and earnings per diluted share accelerated. Demonstrating the significant operating leverage in our business, our second consecutive quarter of 20%-plus revenue growth drove a 260 basis point improvement in our operating ratio and a 47.3% increase in earnings per diluted share to $0.81. We have no doubt that our nearly 20% growth in LTL tonnage for the fourth quarter was due primarily to the consistency and dependability of our outstanding service as we produced in excess of 99% on-time delivery for the quarter and a tonnage ratio of 0.39%. Our long-term leadership in these categories is the intentional result of many factors, including our continuous investment in our people and technologies, combined with expanded capacity in our network and equipment. While this investment strategy clearly differentiates Old Dominion among our industry peers, we believe it is the skill and commitment of our employees that ultimately makes the difference in our ability to sustain such high-quality service. Fourth quarter clearly demonstrates the strengths of the OD family. Our service performance remained at extraordinary levels in the quarter despite the heavy and increasing volume experienced during the period but also poor global weather and a meaningful addition of new employees throughout the year to handle our increased volume. Our fourth quarter performance validates our core commitment to providing our employees ongoing education and training, as well as our continuous investment to make sure our OD family of employees have all the tools they need to exceed our customers' expectations. Our culture of service, innovation and flexibility supports our ability to provide superior service at a fair and equitable price. We expect it to continue contributing significantly to our long-term growth in earnings and shareholder value. So thank you for joining our call today. And now here is David Congdon. David S. Congdon: Good morning. We are very pleased with Old Dominion's financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Our rate of our top line growth accelerated for each period, driving substantial improvement in our operating ratio and strong growth in earnings per share. The dynamics in our business model were abundantly clear during the fourth quarter. A 19.8% increase in LTL tonnage highlighted our significant, continuing gains in market share, while our 3% increase in revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, again demonstrated that our customers value our superior service, sophisticated technology and comprehensive capabilities. With virtually all our tonnage growth generated within our existing service center network, our freight density increased accordingly. This improved density, combined with stronger yields, was primarily responsible for the 260 basis point improvement in our OR to an 84.4% for the quarter. Similar dynamics for the full year drove the 130 basis point improvement to a record 84.2% for 2014. This improved performance occurred even as the company increased our employee base by 16.8% in response to strong tonnage growth. As a result, we continued to experience some negative pressure on our productivity metrics, particularly our dock operations. However, the combined impact of the strong improvement in density and yields more than offset these negative pressures, and our incremental margin rose to 27.6% for the quarter. Our long-term and ongoing record of outperforming the LTL industry supports our belief that, as -- we enter 2015 in a strong, unique and sustainable, competitive position. We are confident that through a clear focus on the execution of our proven business model, we can further leverage our leadership position for the benefit of our customers, our OD family of employees and our shareholders. Thanks for being with us today. And now Wes will review our financial results for the quarter in greater detail. J. Wes Frye : Thank you, David, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue increased by 21.7% for the fourth quarter of 2014 to $721 million from $592.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter earnings per diluted share increased 47.3% to $0.81, $0.55 for the fourth quarter of 2003 (sic) [2013]. And as David mentioned, our revenue growth reflected a 19.8% increase in LTL tonnage comprised of a 17.1% increase in LTL shipments and a 2.3% increase in the LTL weight per shipment. In addition, fourth quarter revenue per hundredweight increased 1.5% versus the same-period prior year quarter. And revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, increased 3%. Revenue per hundredweight was negatively impacted by a 2.3% increase in weight per shipment and a 0.2% decline in our average length of haul, both of which are long-term positive trends driven by ongoing shifts in our freight mix to higher-weighted contractual business and increased volume in our next-day and 2-day regional lanes. Holding this weight per shipment and length of haul constant, we believe our increase in the yield was just over 5%. On a monthly basis, the LTL tonnage per day decreased sequentially by 2.3% for October into [ph] September, increased 4.4% for November and decreased 10.2% for December. This performance generally compared with our 10-year average sequential monthly trend that shows a decrease of 2.9% for October, an increase of 2.9% for November and a decrease of 8.8% for December. On a comparable quarter basis, LTL tonnage increased 20.8% for October, 20.6% for November and 18.5% for December. January 2015 LTL tonnage per day increased by 15.3% versus January of 2014. In the first quarter of 2015, assuming normalized sequential trends, we expect LTL tonnage per day to increase in a range of 12% to 13% compared with the first quarter of 2014. Monthly year-over-year tonnage increases during the first quarter of 2014 compared to 2013 were 10.1% in January, 11.7% in February and 19.7% in March. First quarter of 2015 has the same number of working days as the first quarter of 2014. We expect revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, to be in a range of 4.5% to 5.5% for the first quarter compared with the first quarter last year. Old Dominion's operating ratio improved 260 basis points to an 84.4% for the fourth quarter from 87% for the fourth quarter of 2013, driven primarily by our increased freight density and stronger yields. We also benefited from improvements in our group health and workers' compensation costs; and savings from lower fuel prices, fuel purchasing strategies and fuel efficiencies, which primarily accounted for the 200 basis point reduction in operating supplies and expense. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $56 million, and $368 million for the full year of 2014. Consistent with our strong growth in 2014, we estimate CapEx for 2015 will total approximately $463 million, including planned expenditures of $165 million for real estate; $272 million for tractors, trailers and other equipment; and $26 million for technology and other assets. We expect the sales of assets during the year of 2015 to be approximate $5 million, for a total net CapEx of approximately $458 million. We expect to fund these expenditures primarily through operating cash flow as well as our available borrowing capacity, if necessary. Effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 36.7% compared to 37.2% for the fourth quarter of 2013. And we expect the effective tax rate of 38.6% [ph] for the first quarter of 2015. And this concludes our prepared remarks this morning. And operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for any questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Allison Landry with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Just to clarify, Wes, you mentioned your expectation for first quarter revenue per hundredweight to be up 4.5% to 5.5% year-over-year. Was that on an x fuel basis? J. Wes Frye : It was, yes. Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. So how do we think about that in -- sort of in conjunction with lower fuel and some of the mix headwinds? Does that imply that pricing is sequentially getting stronger? Or are you expecting some of the mix headwinds to subside relative to Q4? J. Wes Frye : Well, I mean that's just our indication of what we experienced in January and our continued emphasis and focus on overall customer profitability and looking to adjust base rates where that profitability yet isn't up to our expectations. So fuel was only a portion of how we look at that by customer. We also are looking and we're getting meaningful increases just in our bench rate as well. Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And what does that imply for incremental margins? Should we see you sort of continue to trend above your sort of longer-term range of 15% to 20%? J. Wes Frye : Well, that implies we'll have incremental margin. We're not giving guidance on that. And I know it's been strong, but we still say, long term, with our margins where they are, that 15% to 20% range. We'll just have to see how pricing, how the economy and other factors that influence that present themselves during the course of the year. Operator : And we'll go next to Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC: So Wes, I think you mentioned that the December tonnage was up a little bit more sequentially than normal seasonality. What about January, was that better or worse than normal sequential? J. Wes Frye : It was slightly worse but not that materially so. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC: So what's your take on that? Is that changing in the economy in some of your end markets? Or is that some of the spillover from truckloads starting to reverse? I know it's just 2 months, but what do you make of that? J. Wes Frye : Well, it wasn't a material-enough change that we associated with the detailed dynamics. It's, I mean, the 10-year average is an average, so that means that there's variance with each year around that. And as long as they're in a reasonable variation of that, then it's just an expectation. But generally, January being down compared to December is typical. And the fact that it was down a little bit more, I don't know at this point if it's very clear that we can make a statement about that. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay, that makes sense. And then just wanted to take your take on fuel and what's your -- any sensitivity you can give us in terms of the potential margin drag or operating income drag could be from lower fuel. And I don't know if you guys have updated your fuel surcharge tables yet. Are you planning to do so? And if you're not, why not? J. Wes Frye : When you say drag or hitting in a tailwind or whatever it was, I assume -- are you referring to the fourth quarter? Because we really aren't in a position to indicate or wouldn't give guidance on what we expect for the first quarter for the year, as you asked. But for the fourth quarter, with the fuel costs declining as they did in [indiscernible], specifically in the last few weeks of the quarter, we think we got a little bit of the benefit but not a lot, maybe 20 to 30 basis points of benefit. How that goes into the first quarter is still early to determine. David S. Congdon: But our general view, Scott, is that things will stabilize. And we've thankfully seen the bottom of fuel prices and they'll probably start gradually increasing during the year. And our fuel surcharge mechanisms are merely one of many components of the pricing equation, and we'll keep an eye on that on a customer-by-customer basis so as to maintain a fair and equitable pricing arrangement with our customers. J. Wes Frye : Which is what we've always done is taking the yield, the customer profitability and not being reactionary, necessarily, with what's going on in the market. We take it on a one-on-one basis and make sure that we're credible with our customers and our pricing still produces a fair and equitable price. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I had a couple of questions around the CapEx side. Is this, increase in your CapEx just as an expression of your confidence in the cycle? Or is it more a function of your own idiosyncratic risk opportunities? J. Wes Frye : It's a little bit of both. Our CapEx, as you see, is quite a bit. And I think, to keep expanding our network, obviously, that's anticipating continuing taking market share, which we think that we're able to do. The other thing the CapEx includes, with all of the rail problems, and we use some rail, not a lot, no more than 1% of our cost, specifically in the Pacific Northwest and some of those other lanes that will have been, as you well know, negatively impacted from a service standpoint. To the extent in order for us to protect our customer service and maintain our 99% on-time service, we actually put our own equipment and our own drivers. And so some of that additional CapEx is just investing in our own equipment and drivers so we can maintain service. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : That's really helpful. And then just with regard to the track to CapEx, can you give us a sense of what percent is the growth versus replacement? J. Wes Frye : We don't give that detail, Tom. I'm sorry. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I just wanted to come really quick back to fuel and fuel surcharges for a second, just kind of curious, as you've been generally speaking about fuel. In a lower fuel environment, does that have any natural pressure on account profitability? I guess I just want to sort of understand that, if possible, a little bit better. David S. Congdon: Well, every single customer has a unique pricing situation based upon their freight and their freight characteristics. And over the years, fuel surcharge versus base rates, versus discounts, and this unique price/mix of each customer, it all boils down to the profitability and the operating ratios that we have with each account. So there's no way to make any kind of a blanket statement regarding where fuel prices are and fuel surcharges are in general for us. We'll take it all on an account-by-account basis. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, okay, no, that's helpful. And I guess, just thinking sort of broadly about the end-market demand and sort of how you're seeing strength or weakness in any one of the individual end markets that you serve. I guess there's some concern about sort of the industrial economy and potential deceleration of growth in those end markets. I just want to get a rough sense of kind of how you're seeing any of that. I know it's early in the first quarter, but any color will be helpful. J. Wes Frye : Well, yes, yes, it's too early in the first quarter. Obviously, for the year in general, around 75% [ph] of our business is industrial. So the fact that, for the year, we were up almost 20% in revenue; and for the quarter, nearly, almost 21%, it -- well, of course, what [indiscernible] is market share, so it's hard to make a statement on what's going on in the macro overall. But I think it's roughly steady. We don't see any end markets that's really greatly growth -- or any regions or by country, that's kind of an outlier in terms of growth. It's all fairly consistent across the board. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : I wanted to ask you a little bit about what we see going on overall in the marketplace on pricing. Of course, there's efforts on geo-rising [ph] and raising fuel -- or rebasing fuel surcharges, I should say. And I'm curious if you think that, that puts you in a much, much stronger position because you can sort of do this approach which is much more sort of regular and you don't kind of try to react as quickly. And so should we expect that, that could actually result in even better market share gains looking forward? Or is this something that, oh, you'll react over time and so maybe you won't be that far off what the rest of the market is doing on price for very long? J. Wes Frye : Bill, we have never, again, endured this [ph] and especially during the downturn that started to 2006 with us. We have never been reactionary. We've always wanted to make sure that we maintain credibility with our customer base and do things as we see them on a customer-by-customer basis. So yes. And the fact that that's manifest in our previous market share increases. We think that the fact that we are consistent in how we look at that world could still benefit us from a market share standpoint. William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : That makes sense. Let me, Wes, also ask you. Obviously, you've been enjoying significant tonnage growth, and even the comments that you've made so far about this year suggests continuation of that trend. And so we've had a step-up in CapEx, and some of that's for service, some of that presumably for capacity. Is the -- how would you manage a situation whereby demands changes in a way that surprises us to the downside? Could you adjust the cost structure? Are you going to find yourself with too much capacity because you got a little bit ahead of yourselves given the growth you've enjoyed? J. Wes Frye : Well, we measured our capacity growth, and this kind of the fixed growth is in service centers. And we're committed to keep on expanding our network. Had we not, then we wouldn't be enjoying the growth of the market share that we're achieving. And we're probably the only LTL carrier that's actually, over the last, for certain, decade, have been investing in network growth as opposed to network reduction. We'll continue to do that in terms of, I mean, there could be a downturn in the economy, for whatever reason, growth but we still will have been committed to expanding our network. On the equipment side, we can adjust the equipment fairly rapidly if we have to on the capacity on that, and that's how we'll look at it. But we are committed to continuing to grow the network from a service and net [ph] capacity. William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : And you don't feel like you'll get caught with too much capacity. J. Wes Frye : Keep in mind, this gets me to put my accounting hat on, that the effect on your -- obviously, it's a cash effect, which we have tremendous borrowing capacity, but on the income effect, our service center acquisition really does have a minimal effect. Keep in mind that this $10 million on a service center, the land portion of that and which will be extended depending on the area of the country, could be 25% to 50% of that cost, which does not appreciate, so there's no impact on your income statement. And when you take the structure and you put a residual on that, and then you depreciate the net of that over 20 years. So that has much less of an impact by investing in the structure than it would be if you leased it. Leasing always has a direct effect, but most leases have CPI inflators every year, so it increases accordingly. And I'd now mention that we own almost 80% of our service centers now and close to 9% of the normal number of doors, so from that standpoint, we are somewhat insulated, because we own those facilities going forward, on the impact of our income statement. David S. Congdon: Bill, as far as feeling like if we had a downturn in the economy, have we overinvested and had too much capacity and whatnot? My answer to that would be we are -- we see the LTL industry as a very viable industry for the long-term future of our country. And we are committed to our growing our position as the leader in the LTL industry. And I don't think we'll ever feel like we overinvested because we're here to continue to grow and be a very strong player. And so if there's a real a downturn in the economy, we will adjust our variable expenses, as we did in the last downturn, but it sure is nice to adjust your expenses from an 84 operating ratio, as opposed to the rest of the industry of a 95. Operator : We will take our next question from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : As a follow-up to kind of one of Bill's question, Wes, with regard to the tonnage guidance of 12% to 13% in Q1, are you assuming any impact from some of the competitor adjustments to the fuel surcharge programs? As I haven't seen any adjustments to date on your website. J. Wes Frye : All right, since we are not geniuses on how that's affected, we have not assumed that. And so we just look in, as I mentioned in my comments, at what would be a normal sequential trend as the quarter progresses. And that's what we based on. Keep in mind, I also mentioned in my comments, we're 15% up in gain way [ph] but I've only given guidance 12% to 13%, is that as the quarter progressed, the year-over-year percentage growth was stronger such that almost 20% in March of last year. But it's a couple... Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay, that makes sense. That color is helpful. And in terms just kind of us better understanding kind of the puts and takes of the fuel expense, can you give us a sense of how big that is as a percentage of the operating supplies and expense category? J. Wes Frye : We're not giving that detail currently. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. John L. Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Wes, I'm thinking about longer term in terms of the market share. It seems like Old Dominion has done a great job of capturing market share with a better-quality freight, the stuff for their high service demand, where you're getting paid literally well to move that kind of freight. As you start to look at capturing share maybe in the next bands of freight, does it carry with it risk to pricing or risk to the margin at all to capture, maybe once you've exhausted the opportunity, in kind of the higher levels of freight? Is that a risk at all? J. Wes Frye : Well, it's for sure that the LTL market, from when you say that's $35 billion, $40 billion or $50 billion, depends on who you're talking to. There's a certain portion of that market that's very price sensitive, but obviously, there's a significant and growing portion of that market that is servicing communities as well, and that's the market that we play in so that we continue to get service. There's no reason to think that we won't continue to achieve growth in market share. And we've given guidance that we expect to reach double-digit market share in the next 3 to 5 years, and that depends on what your denominator is. John L. Barnes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay, all right. All right, very good. And then one other question, just on the labor front. Obviously, a couple of your competitors have been distracted by labor issues. Can you just talk at all, has it cropped up with you guys at all? Have you seen any kind any attempts anywhere? Because thus far, it certainly seems isolated to a couple of your competitors. Earl E. Congdon: We have had -- it's Earl. We have had no labor problems. We have an excellent relationship with all of our employees. We work on it day and night. And we have -- yes, we call it the Old Dominion family spirit. But our people feel like they're part of that -- of the company family. And we treat them so well that we would be mighty surprised if the teamsters were able to gain a foothold in Old Dominion. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brad Delco with Stephens. A. Brad Delco - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Wes, I wanted to ask you a little bit about the meaningful acceleration in your -- in pricing, based on your comments. The revenue per hundredweight, x fuel, is up 3% in the fourth quarter. And you guided to 4.5% to 5.5%. Can you just talk about how that sort of progressed? And is that a function of more aggressive pricing actions you started taking last year? Or is there some mix impact of that? Or just help me understand a little bit why we're seeing that acceleration. J. Wes Frye : Yes, Brad. If you remember what I said in my comments, I indicated the 2.3% increase in weight per shipment and the reduction in length of haul were fixed at really that yield. And the fourth quarter was more like 5%, so maybe a little above that. So if you guys compare to 5% now, I'll have to say that we're expecting the weight per shipment and the length of haul in the first quarter to be well -- relatively flat. So you'll have year-over-year in the first quarter and compared to '14, to 2014, so therefore we're not expecting quite that pressure on the revenue per hundredweight. So when you look at it that way, the 4.5% to 5% and compare it to the adjusted 5% in the fourth quarter, it becomes fairly constant. David S. Congdon: I mean, furthermore, Brad, to answer your question, which was, are we taking any different action, and the answer is no. We continue to as we've always done, look at each and every account. And it's on there. And I think it's mostly just more of a mathematical thing whenever you're changing strategy or direction. We're staying consistent with our strategies. A. Brad Delco - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Got you. And maybe more of a higher-level question but kind of piggybacks off the last one. Are you seeing any pressure, inflationary pressure on wages? It seems like some of your competitors have raised wages in order to try to put to bed some of those labor issues. As a result, are you seeing any pressure on that line? Or what in general would you expect your inflationary bucket to be this year on your cost line items? David S. Congdon: Well, Brad, we're not seeing any pressure because we've been consistently in how -- in giving wage increases all during the downturn and currently, meaningful wage increases. And so we believe that we should give wage increases that are based upon the productivity and the motivation that are really the family [ph]. We're -- we've been very consistent in that. So no, we're not getting any pressure on wages. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt Brooklier with Longbow Research. Matthew S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC : So just a follow-up on the CapEx budget, which is pretty robust for '15. I'm trying to get a sense for if you can provide more color in terms of service centers and potentially the number of service centers that you plan to open in '15 and then maybe also talk about expanding capacity at some of the existing centers in your network. J. Wes Frye : I won't get too detailed, but if you'll notice just looking at our service center account, it really hasn't increased that much in the last 3 or 4 years. So most of our CapEx is either replacing an existing service center that we've outgrown with a larger one or expanding an existing service center. And 80% of that $165 million is for that purpose. So we continue to invest on increasing or buying -- building larger facilities. For example, we spent $30 million building a new Memphis facility that's state-of-the-art last year, in 2014. So you still have some of those projects that were included in that addition line [ph]. David S. Congdon: And as far as opening any additional service centers, my guess is it will be less than 5. Earl E. Congdon: Yes. David S. Congdon: Yes, for the next coming year. But we've got our eyes on a couple of cities where we might expand and open a new service center. And it all kind of hinges on, and always has, on finding either land which you can build on, with the local people will allow you to build a [indiscernible] terminal, or finding a facility that we can either renovate or expand to meet our needs. Matthew S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC : Okay, very helpful, kind of helping along with thinking about density as we move on and you guys grow. And then the second question, relating to headcount. You guys ramped up headcount at a pretty quick pace to support the strong tonnage growth that you had within your network. It looks like tonnage is coming down a little bit in the first quarter, part of that just on the more difficult comps. But just trying to think about headcount and how you're thinking about headcount additions during this year. David S. Congdon: So obviously, we're in a slower period of time but -- in this first -- part of the first quarter. And we will anticipate needing a little more headcount as we get into March, but one good thing about our moderation, if you will, in our growth rate is that it should allow us to regain some of that productivity that we lost and continue also to maintain and improve our claim ratio where it is now. So a little bit of moderating growth rate is not bad right now to give us a slight breather in that it could actually help us out with our bottom line there. So we look at where we see our sequential trend is going with shipments and tonnage going forward. And we will obviously add headcount as we deem fit, going forward, to be able to handle whatever shipment and tonnage levels we will anticipate. Operator : We'll take our next question from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Clark Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : David, just on that last point, is there a way for us to think about where the employee productivity is? I mean it's -- the numbers are obviously very strong. The incremental margins are good, so it's difficult to really see kind of where the employee productivity is coming through, or maybe it isn't. But I mean is there a way to think about the average tenure of the employee or where -- how the employees are today versus how you think about it from a normalized level? David S. Congdon: Well, obviously, with the fact that we hired over 2,000 employees this year, we have some relatively young tenured people on payroll right now. Aside from the new people, our general tenure and turnover, tenure is long and turnover is low with our workforce. But as far as the productivity side, I don't know, maybe Wes, do you have an operating comment on that? J. Wes Frye : We maintain pretty good productivity considering the almost 17% addition to our employee base, but we did have some headwinds, especially on the docks, on the platforms. We saw productivity drop there because there were so many new adds. And it's -- and the claim period is 60 to 90 days, and we've been going through that all year. So we expect to see some improvements in productivity in 2015 on that and in pickup and delivery. We actually have some improvement in our laden load average, which is our linehaul productivity measure, last year. So we hope to improve on that more. So -- but we did have some headwinds with the new employees, and we expect that to improve. Todd Clark Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Wes, do you have a sensitivity from an OR standpoint, I mean, how many basis points of margin that might have been? J. Wes Frye : We do have a sensitivity, but we are not going to give you that here. Todd Clark Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay, that's fair enough. And then I'll ask you another one kind of along the same lines. But it seems like, maybe in 2014, your purchased transportation was suboptimal given some things outside of your control that was the rail service or elevated third-party costs. How do we think about purchased transportation given the investment that you're making in the fleet and maybe some normalization in rail service as we move forward? J. Wes Frye : So I'm not sure what you mean when you say our purchased transportation was suboptimal. Purchased transportation as in the report it -- keep in mind that there's 3 categories with that purchased transportation. There's all this, that purchased transportation that we use all in the -- in certain lanes, on rail and truckload and with the LTL, and that's really only about 2%. And the rail portion of that, which, historically, has been 1%, has dropped to only 0.5% because we've been putting our own equipment and drivers in those lanes that are -- with which the rail service has been, as you know, very poor. So we started mixing that with our own equipment. And the other 2 pieces, we have 2 other segments of our service and products, which is truckload brokerage and also our freight forwarding, global freight forwarding. So as you know -- and that means it's our purchased transportation as well. And those 2 segments have had meaningful growth. So mathematically, as that grows, so will they as a percentage, but... Earl E. Congdon: Exactly. J. Wes Frye : And I'm sorry. Yes. And our dredge operation is currently all of these operators as well, which so recorded in purchased transportation. Todd Clark Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay, that's good color, yes. I was thinking about the piece that should be moving on rail but haven't been. And it seems like that's less than 1% or something like that. J. Wes Frye : Currently, we have no shipments moving on rail because of the service, but we all are using -- utilizing our own drivers and equipment for that. And we have no rail on our purchased transportation currently. And it dropped to almost nothing by the end of the fourth quarter. Todd Clark Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : But you would expect to resume that as you move through '15 if the rail service can get back to more normalized levels. J. Wes Frye : Not necessarily. Right now, we've only already invested in our own equipment to provide superior service. So we may tune up to keep that cost down and continue to grow market share in those lanes, is what we are currently doing because of that, the service we're providing in those lanes. Operator : And we'll take our next question from David Ross with Stifel. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : David, I got a question on the hours of service rollback. You mentioned last year that the changes to some of the provisions were costing you a little bit of productivity in the linehaul network. And with the rollback at least of that kind of start-stop times, are you getting any more productivity back? Or are you just assuming that those provisions eventually are going to come back in and then leaving the network as if it was changed last year? David S. Congdon: Well, it did create a little bit of a headwind back when they made that change last summer, but it should increase our flexibility a little bit now where we see the drivers can run a linehaul trip on the weekend now with -- today with -- to that, under that, during that period of time. And also, some of our road drivers will be able to get an extra trip in as well. Some of the scheduled guys that want to run an extra trip on the weekend are going to being able to use the 34-hour restart for all the huge days [ph]. So it's not a material thing, to be honest with you. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : And then any update on the LCV push in D.C.? David S. Congdon: Well, hopefully, David, we're making some progress on the Hill educating members of the Congress on the Senate and the House side. And we're hopeful that we will get some language saying you'll allow 33-foot trailers, so the LTL trailers, in this highway bill if we get the highway bill, okay? First objective is to get the highway bill. And I think that the Congress is working diligently on making that happen, so -- and if that happens, we're hopeful to get some productivity improvements with train 33s. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Campbell with Thompson, Davis & Company. David Pearce Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Company: I just want to ask how many service centers there are. I had 230 in the fourth quarter. I don't know if that's right. J. Wes Frye : It's not right. We had 222. David Pearce Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Company: 222 in the fourth quarter, up. That's from the beginning of the year. There wasn't any increase. It's like we got, we had a decrease, but... J. Wes Frye : That's 221 at the beginning of the year, I believe. I don't have my numbers in front of me. So that's an addition of 1, thinking my math is correct, Dave. David Pearce Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Company: And you may increase it as many as to the -- as many as 5 new ones this year. J. Wes Frye : As David mentioned, subject to being able to find land and getting the appropriate approvals, we may add anywhere from 3 to 5. David Pearce Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Company: And if it didn't do that, would you expand the existing facilities? J. Wes Frye : If we could expand them, likely we would -- that's what we'd already be doing. But in some cases, we had -- recall that the density of the metro area. It's more efficient to add service centers in certain metro areas rather than to expand. David S. Congdon: And David, our CapEx for this upcoming year is $165 million toward real estate. And to be honest with you, the majority of those projects are on the smaller-scale size. And they're really dedicated toward expanding some capacity at various centers, service centers. David Pearce Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Company: Was -- most of that is -- was not in the -- it's not for new centers. David S. Congdon: There may be 1 or 2 new ones in that list, that's all, but the majority of it is expansion and renovations of existing facilities. David Pearce Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Company: So if you open up 5 or begin work on 5, CapEx might be more. David S. Congdon: We don't anticipate CapEx being any more than what we've budgeted because we've looked at that very closely. Operator : We'll take our next question from Willard Milby with BB&T Capital Markets. Willard P. Milby - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Just wanted to see if you all could provide a couple of figures that you normally give with the Qs and Ks, starting off with, I guess, fuel surcharge as a percent of revenues both for Q4 and the year, then the diesel fuel expense for the year as a percentage of revenues. J. Wes Frye : I don't know where you get that from our Ks and Qs. We do not disclose that. Willard P. Milby - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Not the fuel expense you have but the surcharge dollars as a percent of revenue. J. Wes Frye : No, we do not disclose that. I mean you can calculate it and we'll let you do that by looking at certain statistics, but we do not... Willard P. Milby - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Maybe just surcharge dollars then. J. Wes Frye : We do not disclose that. Willard P. Milby - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. All right, moving on. The propane tax credit, I guess, for -- that other LTLs are seeing, were you all affected by that this year? And what was that after the, I guess... J. Wes Frye : Well, we don't know that it'll be extended into 2015. We did have a positive number on that in our tax -- bulk tax in the fourth quarter. Willard P. Milby - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : And what was that fourth quarter? J. Wes Frye : Well, it's all embedded in our effective tax rate, which could include others and -- but that was one of the reasons our effective tax rate was lower than what we originally guided to. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ben Hartford with Robert Baird. Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Real quick, Wes, just want to get your perspective on weather and the impact in the first quarter of '15 versus '14. Obviously, we have the Northeast storms recently, but I'm assuming that you're modeling the weather-related expense and impact in this year's fourth quarter to be below prior year. Is that right? J. Wes Frye : Somewhat. And obviously, we don't know what the weather will entail for us for the rest of the quarter, but certainly, last year, especially in January and February, as you -- I'm sure, and you'll recall, as you're sitting there, laughing. I did all the way through. And so obviously, January, we have negative impact January this year, not sure how the overall are compared to the January of last year but with both years. So I -- we're just kind of fashioning that the weather will at least be fair for the rest of the quarter and that sequential trends will be very normalized. Operator : It appears there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Earl Congdon for any additional or closing remarks. Earl E. Congdon: Thank you. Well, guys, as always, we thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and your support of Old Dominion. And feel free to give us a call later if you have further questions and good day. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to the company's Executive Chairman, Mr. Earl Congdon. Please go ahead, sir. Earl E. Congdon: Good morning. Thanks for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. With me this morning are David Congdon, Old Dominion's President and CEO; and Wes Frye, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion had a great start to 2015 with strong first quarter results despite severe weather in many regions during the quarter and a somewhat stagnant economy. Although our revenue growth for the quarter reflected the expected decline in fuel surcharge, we continued to produce double-digit growth in tons per day with a strong yield improvement. As a result, we achieved a company record for first quarter revenue earnings and operating ratio highlighted by a 200 basis point improvement in OR for the quarter and a 37.7% growth in earnings per diluted share. We continue to credit our substantial and consistent long-term growth with our ability to deliver on-time, claims-free service throughout our expansive network at a fair price. The success of this value proposition reflects the high level of commitment by our outstanding team of dedicated employees. We will continue to provide our employees with the tools and technology with training and education and the infrastructure and equipment capacity that is necessary for us to continue to exceed our customers\u2019 expectations. We expect that our continued successful execution of our business model will drive further growth in market share, earnings and shareholder value. Thanks for being with us today, and now here is David Congdon. David S. Congdon: Good morning. We continue to be pleased with Old Dominion\u2019s outstanding performance as evidenced by a strong profitable growth for the first quarter of 2015. Growth in tons per day of 11.4% for the quarter in which our revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, increased 6.2% is a compelling indication of the demand for our truly differentiated value proposition. We continue to deliver on our promise to provide superior customer service during the first quarter with all-time service of over 99% and a cargo claim ratio of just 0.36%. We have been able to sustain this performance over the long term through our focus on execution, discipline and investment. Our success in executing our business model is evidenced by the long-term consistency of our industry-leading service performance. The sustainability of our model has been tested by economic downturns, severe winter weather, strong volume and market recoveries, and even by the 17% increase in employees over the past year. Yet throughout, we have maintained our commitment to best-in-class customer service. Our discipline is also evidenced on the decisions we make every day. We operate a proven, flexible and innovative business model but it requires constant discipline in yield management and investments in our network, people and technology to make it work well. These steady investments in our network infrastructure and equipment have created strong long-term gains in productivity and efficiency, as well as giving us the flexibility to take advantage of industry consolidation and strong volume growth. It also created and continued to enhance a cutting-edge technology-based operation that offers our customers tremendous transparency under the services we provide them. To leverage this investment and capacity in technology, we also invest in our employees. Our focus is not only to give our entire team the education and training they need to exceed our customers\u2019 expectations but also to sustain a companywide service-oriented culture that rewards the innovation and flexibility with which our employees approach their jobs. Old Dominion\u2019s long-term performance validates our business model with a consistent focus on execution, discipline and investment in creating a strong, unique and competitive market position that increases our ability to drive long-term growth in earnings and shareholder value, we think we have also redefined what it takes to be competitive in our industry. Thanks for joining us today and for your interest in Old Dominion. Now Wes will review our financial results for the first quarter in greater detail. J. Wes Frye : Thank you, David, and good morning. Old Dominion\u2019s revenue was 696.2 million for the first quarter, which was up 12.2% from 620.3 million for the first quarter of 2014. With a 200 basis point improvement in our operating ratio from 85.1 for the previous quarter, earnings per diluted share grew 37.7%, $0.73 from $0.53 in the first quarter of last year. Our financial results were driven by an 11.4% increase in LTL tonnage per quarter, which was comprised of a 13.5% increase in LTL shipments and a 9.8% decrease in LTL weight per shipment. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 0.4% for the quarter, and excluding the revenue per hundredweight of fuel surcharge, increased 6.2%. Revenue per hundredweight was favorably affected by the decrease in weight per shipment while length of haul was roughly flat. Holding the weight per shipment constant, we believe our increase in yield was just under 5% for the first quarter at the net point of our guidance of between 4.5% and 5.5%, which was based upon that assumption. On a monthly basis, LTL tonnage per day increased sequentially by 1.3% for January from December, decreased 0.3% for February and increased 8.3% for March. This performance compared with our 10-year average sequential month trend that shows an increase of 1.9% for January and increase of 3% for February and an increase of 5% for March. From a comparable quarter basis, LTL tonnage per day increased 15.3% for January, 9.4% for February and 9.2% for March. We expect April 2015 LTL tonnage per day to increase approximately 9.5% versus April of 2014. The second quarter of 2015 assumed normalized sequential trends, we expect LTL tonnage per day to increase in a range of 9% to 2% compared with the second quarter of 2014. Monthly, year-over-year tonnage increased during the second quarter of 2014 compared to 2013 were 14.1% in April, 15.5% in May, 14.8% in June. Second quarter of 2015 has the same number of workdays as the second quarter of 2014. We expect revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, to be in a range of 5.5% to 6% for the second quarter compared to the second quarter of last year. This expectation assumes our year-over-year LTL weight per shipment to be down 3% to 3.5% with a flat length of haul. In April, our LTL weight per shipment is expected to be down 3.4%. Strong improvement in Old Dominion\u2019s operating ratio primarily reflected our increased density and strong yield. A significant decline in yield prices resulted in a 450 basis point reduction in operating supplies and expense. However, the decline in yield prices also decreased our fuel surcharge revenue. Revenue is the denominator in the operating ratio equation. Other expenses expressed as a percent of revenue increased during the quarter as a direct result of the decline in fuel surcharge revenue, for example, hourly wage, salaries, wages and benefits expense increased 270 basis points, despite only a slight reduction in productivity and an improvement in our group health and worker\u2019s compensation costs. Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2015 was 72.2 million. We continue to estimate CapEx for the entire of 2015 will be approximately 463.3 million including planned expenditures of 164.7 million for real estate, 279.8 million for tractors, trailers and other equipment, 26.8 million for technology and other assets. After anticipating asset sales, we expect total net CapEx of approximately 458 million, which we plan to fund primarily through operating cash flow as well as our available borrowing capacity, if necessary. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2015 was 38.6% compared with 40.6% for the first quarter of 2014. We expect an effective tax rate of 38.6% also with the second quarter of 2015. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we\u2019ll be happy to open the floor for any questions at this time. Operator : Yes, sir. Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Christian Wetherbee : Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe starting with a question on the cost side, you mentioned the headcount up 17% and as we\u2019re still seeing very robust volume growth but maybe at a slightly slower pace then what we\u2019ve seen in the last several quarters, how should we think about that going forward? Do you feel like you\u2019re staffed appropriately for the growth you expect this year, or should that continue to ramp up? And maybe how do you think about that in terms of the incremental margins you\u2019re able to put up knowing that you don\u2019t give guidance on that topic? J. Wes Frye : Chris, this is Wes. It\u2019s kind of unusual that we will add \u2013 in the first quarter we\u2019ll add employee counts faster than our revenue growth in anticipation of the seasonal uptick in the second quarter, because of one reason, just because of our training timelines, so it\u2019s not unusual. It happens pretty much every first quarter as we anticipate further tonnage growth. Christian Wetherbee : Okay. So this is \u2013 typical seasonality is the way to think about it. And when you think \u2013 thinking about sort of the second quarter and maybe the rest of the year I guess, are you seeing any sort of pockets of softness within the customer base that you\u2019re looking at and sort of how are you guys thinking about maybe sort of the rest of this year as it might play out? Are you a little bit more concerned about the pace of tonnage growth? I know it\u2019s still very robust. You\u2019re taking share. But I just kind of want to get a sense of how you\u2019re thinking about the world. J. Wes Frye : I guess we can address that by just talking a little bit about some of the details of what we saw in the first quarter. As we mentioned, our weight per shipment in the first quarter was down 1.8%. If you look underneath that, it was clear to us that the biggest industry sector of that decline was in the retail sector. And I think two things went on there. Number one, as you obviously know, the GDP overall and even in the retail sector was fairly stagnant. I think it was like 22%. And so we expect that to be slow. And the second thing is the truckload spillover, as you recall, last year is maybe \u2013 it\u2019s our opinion that the retail sector was diverting a lot of what would normally be truckload over to LTL to get goods to the market. And that\u2019s one reason why we saw and are still seeing a pretty robust velocity in the number of shipments, albeit they\u2019re just lower weight \u2013 is that we\u2019re having to get those to the market. We\u2019re still seeing in April, which I mentioned, our weight per shipment is down 3.4% and that we still think that\u2019s still a combination of macro and still a combination of the change and the truckload spillover. So hopefully that helps. It\u2019s just the retail is probably the most \u2013 we actually saw industrial weight per shipment in velocity very strong in the first quarter and are still seeing that. So I guess the bottom line is you got to produce it before you sell. Christian Wetherbee : All right, that\u2019s very fair. Thanks for the time, guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good morning. So just following up on that last point. Expectations for weight per shipment continue to be down in the second quarter. What is that sort of telling you about sort of the macro environment going forward? Are your customers concerned about inventory levels? Do you think at some point the consumer will actually start buying some goods? What\u2019s your overall view there? David S. Congdon: Allison, this is David. Let me throw in just one more element that Wes didn\u2019t mention, and it has to do with the port strikes and all the backlog of container ships and so forth that when the product finally hit the shores where it can be shipped, shippers were shipping what they had \u2013 they\u2019ve been shipping what they had to ship what they had available to ship and waiting for the product to hit the shore. And I think that had an impact on the overall weight per shipment in our industry in the first quarter. Will we see a decline in weight per shipment in second quarter and is it a macro? It\u2019s really hard to say, because the retail shipments were slower in the first quarter, and that\u2019s what Wes was saying, and their shipment sizes were slower. I think a lot of that did have to do with that port congestion and their issues on the West Coast. Another thing that might be affecting our weight per shipment is that it\u2019s obvious that we are winning some market share and it\u2019s basically coming across the board, across the country, our industry peer group has a lower weight per shipment than we have. And so it stands to reason that if we\u2019re winning market share then that might be pulling our weight per shipment down a little bit. Allison Landry : Okay. That\u2019s actually good color. And then just following up and speaking about headcounts, just sort of its tonnage and store demand does fall off, what\u2019s your sort of contingency plan for headcount for the balance of the year? J. Wes Frye : Keep in mind we still guided second quarter to be in a range of 9% tonnage growth, so I wouldn\u2019t call that falling off. But to David\u2019s point, that tonnage is based on the fact that we\u2019re seeing a reduced weight per shipment. And as he also pointed out, we don\u2019t really know. If we do get some traction on retail and GDP in the second quarter, it could be that that weight per shipment does start to go up again. David S. Congdon: Another point I\u2019ll add is that you\u2019ve seen our history of managing through downturns, upturns or whatever, we have a very good control over how our turns is going and our headcounts that we need to serve our customers and keep our cost in control. Allison Landry : Absolutely. All right, thank you guys so much for the time. David S. Congdon: Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from A. Brad Delco with Stephens Inc. A. Brad Delco : Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question. Wes, the first one for you, is there any way to sort of quantify on a year-over-year basis what the weather comp looked like for you? I know weather was an issue this quarter, but was it \u2013 anyway you could put dollars to what it was this year versus last year? J. Wes Frye : Keep in mind, Brad, that there is a way to do it. We just haven\u2019t really spent a lot of time doing it and the reason is, in neither the first quarter of 2014 or 2015 had any spring-like characteristics to it. They were both kind of bad. So to try to get the differential, we take it the differential this year without going back and seeing what the effect was last year and to tell the truth, we think that that was kind of neutral. And January 2014 was the really tough month of weather in 2014 and it turns out that it looks like February was a really tough month regarding weather this year. So it\u2019s kind of an offset between those two months, but overall they both had very similar in negative effects. So to get the differential, it may not be that much and we didn\u2019t take time to look at that. We still improved the operating ratio 200 basis points. A. Brad Delco : No, results were clearly good. I was just trying to get a sense in terms of a comparison, was it a better weather quarter year-over-year or roughly the same? It sounds like it was roughly the same. J. Wes Frye : Well, roughly the same as we had last year. David S. Congdon: Yes, both terrible in the description, correct. A. Brad Delco : And then, Wes, on your commentary about revenue per hundredweight up 5.5% to 6.5% year-over-year, I mean that\u2019s an acceleration from what you guided first quarter. Obviously, weight per shipment will adjust that number. Is it fair to say that roughly, if you adjusted weight per shipment, then kind of that core pricing, excluding mix, is around the 4% range or what\u2019s kind of the --? J. Wes Frye : Maybe you were late but I did comment on that in my script. If you hold the weight per shipment constant in both quarters then the revenue per hundredweight yield would have been up around 5%. So looking at it that way and keeping in mind the guidance that we gave in the first quarter 5% and 6.5% was based upon that assumption that we are really right at the midpoint of that assumption. It wasn\u2019t \u2013 are you talking about [Multiple Speakers] yes, I\u2019m sorry. This quarter if you did hold that constant, we would still be in that 5% range. A. Brad Delco : Okay. Perfect. That\u2019s just the point of clarification. J. Wes Frye : I apologize. A. Brad Delco : No worries. Well, thanks for the time, guys. Congrats on the good quarter. Operator : Next question comes from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. William Greene : Hi, there. Good morning. Wes, I just want to ask for a little bit of clarification on some of the second quarter guide. So we\u2019ve got a little bit of slowing tonnage growth but not so bad, but you\u2019ve hired in advance so I assume we\u2019ll see some productivity as those new employees get up and become more productive. We typically think of the second quarter seasonality being a 400 basis point improvement in margins but second quarter is often a really strong quarter. So how do you weigh those pieces, tonnage growth slowing a little bit, yields holding but productivity getting better? My sense is it could end up being quite a good quarter, even though I know you don\u2019t give guidance, but I\u2019m just trying to think through the puts and takes there. J. Wes Frye : You want me to answer all those questions. William Greene : Well, the basic question is, can seasonality, is that a reasonable basis for thinking about second quarter, because there\u2019s a lot of moving parts. J. Wes Frye : I think, overall, the second quarter was a little bit tougher comparison evidenced by our tonnage growth in the second quarter '14 over '13, so that the comparisons make it a little bit tougher but still I think the 9% and 10% guidance is based upon what we\u2019re seeing in April and we\u2019re still getting tremendous velocity on a number of shipments. The fact is that the weight per shipment is down to 3.4% and that\u2019s kind of what I based our guidance on. If that should change, then we can be a little more optimistic. But right now, we don\u2019t see that transparency at this point. Hopefully, we will, but we have some slippage over the last five to six months or maybe even longer on the dock because we had hired so many people and we have so much ongoing training expense with them. And to be honest, I think it takes a dock worker at least six months to get up to speed and get to where he can produce at the level that the more seasoned dock workers produce at. So we would expect some incremental improvement in our dock productivity during the second quarter, because we are fairly stabilized with our quantity of people handling our current shipment levels. The other thing, Bill, our increase in our 559 was effective this year on January 1 of 2015, so we got the benefit in terms of yield on that for the entire quarter, whereas in the second quarter when we looked at kind of the lower \u2013 on the yield guidance, it\u2019s based upon the fact that last year we had a May 1 implementation. And I know that the yield guidance was actually stronger in the second quarter than what actually was in the first quarter, but that\u2019s because the weight per shipment is down 3% as opposed to 1.8 in the first. William Greene : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful color. David, I would like to sort of run one question by you and I know \u2013 we don\u2019t know if this will happen yet, but in so far as we got 33-foot trailers approved here, Old Dominion\u2019s always been out and ahead on productivity. How big a deal is that for you from a productivity standpoint? David S. Congdon: I think it will be \u2013 take a little bit longer to gain the productivity on this because if we get 33-foot trailers, we will obviously shift the production of 28s to 33s and start gradually putting them into our network and determining which traffic lanes we will be running these 33s in. So I see us implementing this thing on some of our longest haul lanes that had the highest amount of freight lane density first. So it will be something that we will putting them in as we buy new trailers. We have not made any decisions yet on retrofitting or extending our current 28s. The cost of that has turned up a little bit higher than we originally thought, but I just see it as not a major transformational thing. If we were able to haul triple trailers all of a sudden across the country, then we\u2019d see a transformational change. William Greene : Okay, very helpful. I appreciate the time. Thanks so much. Operator : Next question comes from Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Thomas Kim : Thanks. Good morning. I have a question on labor productivity. Your shipments per employee or tonnage per employee has been sort of trending down since 2013. And I know you said that you\u2019re adding headcount ahead of growth, which makes a lot of sense. But I\u2019m wondering like, can you get back to 2011, '12 levels of productivity and how long does that take? J. Wes Frye : Obviously, you\u2019re dividing that by total employees and total employees, all of them doesn\u2019t move freight. And so we\u2019ve been into monetization and we\u2019ve had to add IT resources and others as we grow. But I think we can still get back as we \u2013 of course, getting back to that productivity somewhat implies that maybe we\u2019re aren\u2019t growing as strong, and we don\u2019t that that will be the case. We\u2019ll always have a certain amount of new employees that are in the training mode, as David mentioned earlier. But I certainly think that we can get back to the '12, '13 levels. But the dynamics of freight moving continues to change and more and more requests for appointment freight and certain characteristics that just takes more labor as well. Now the question is, if that happens, can you get that in the price, and apparently we\u2019ve been very successful in doing that. Thomas Kim : Yes, that\u2019s definitely absolutely right. And I guess just also with regard to utilization levels since I\u2019m trying to understand, like your incremental costs associated with additional volume you\u2019re bringing on. I\u2019m wondering where are your service yield utilization [ph] rates at presently? And can you continue to push more shipments or more tonnage through per station? David S. Congdon: Yes, that\u2019s an ongoing process when it comes to service centers and capacity and how much more you can push through stations. As evidenced by our CapEx for service centers, we continually having to expand and/or build new centers for our largest cities where we grow the fastest, whereas some of the smaller cities that we may have 50 doors in the city that only needs 20 or 25 and heck you could more than \u2013 we could handle a heck of a lot more freight through some of our service centers. So it\u2019s just kind of ongoing evolutionary thing. Thomas Kim : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Jason Seidl : Hi, Earl. Hi, David. Hi, Wes. Guys, thanks for the time this morning. Wes, going back to the weight per shipment trends, obviously the West Coast port is probably throwing a little monkey wrench in the comparison. Are you seeing now in 2Q now that the port stuff moving and the cleanup going through, are you seeing more retail shipments here early in 2Q? J. Wes Frye : I\u2019ll say that the weight per retail shipments starting off in April is not down as much as what it was in the first quarter, so that\u2019s an indication that perhaps it has improved. It\u2019s still not positive, it\u2019s still down but that would indicate some improvement there. Jason Seidl : So is the weight per shipment on the industrial side that\u2019s dragging down more in 2Q then for you? J. Wes Frye : Well, the weight per shipment on the industrial side in the first quarter was relatively flat. At least in April at this point, we\u2019re seeing it down slightly. So they produced them in the first quarter. Now they\u2019re moving them and now they got to start producing some more. Jason Seidl : Okay. J. Wes Frye : But we still see the macro at this point. I don\u2019t know how else to characterize it other than very sluggish at this point. And I know the economists are talking about 30% GDP for the year and it was only 0.2% for the first quarter. There should be a pickup in them. So we\u2019ll be interested as everyone to see if our weight per shipment and demand increases. And to tell the truth, we expect it to. Jason Seidl : You know how estimates are, Wes. You make estimates and you make them often. On the 3PL side of business that you\u2019re doing with the 3PL, are you seeing a change in the shipments that you\u2019re getting from them either up or down? J. Wes Frye : About the same. In the second quarter, weight per shipment for our 3PL and logistics partners were maybe down slightly but okay and it\u2019s still down. But keep in mind that that\u2019s a pretty good mix of retail, industrial and we don\u2019t necessary have transparency on that across the board. But we still are growing favorably and developing very good relationships with our 3PL partners. Jason Seidl : Okay. I think, Wes, that about does it for me, so I appreciate the time as always. J. Wes Frye : Thank you, Jason. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Robert Salmon : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. As a quick follow up to Jason\u2019s last question, Wes, with your comments about the 3PL shipments, were you speaking as a percentage of your total shipments or just the absolute numbers in terms of it being flattish to slightly down? J. Wes Frye : I was speaking of the weight per shipment, Rob, on 3PL in the first quarter. Robert Salmon : Okay. I guess, Wes, then if you\u2019re thinking about just the overall shipments, did that remain pretty constant as a percentage of the book or it kind of tail off? J. Wes Frye : It remains fairly constant but growing. Right now, it\u2019s around 34% to 35% of our total shipments. Robert Salmon : Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Wes, if I could switch gears a little bit to some of the ancillary services that you\u2019re offering, it looked like that growth accelerated a little bit last quarter. How are you guys thinking about the growth there? Are there any new verticals that you\u2019re adding to the suite of services like kind of the home delivery \u2013 well, not home delivery but home movement services that you\u2019re already offering and the dredge business? J. Wes Frye : Of course, in the first quarter, our dredge business was significantly impacted by the West Coast ports as you might imagine and resurgence there as we speak. And as far as the home moving, of course, that\u2019s a seasonal business and while it\u2019s growing very nicely, we expect that to continue to grow at least from a revenue standpoint. So we expect still continued growth in all those services; freight, forwarding, dredge and our specialized LTL services like home moving and expedited. So we do expect a couple of brokerage and we do expect continued growth in all these segments of our business. Robert Salmon : Okay. So it sounds like it was just more execution as opposed to adding any new services in terms of last quarter. J. Wes Frye : I think so, yes. Robert Salmon : Thanks so much for the time. Operator : Next question is Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Fowler : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask on the balance between share repurchases and CapEx, it\u2019s going to be a heavy CapEx year and it feels like it\u2019s going to be building in the next couple of quarters. You were buying back some stock here in the first quarter. How do you think about share repurchases? Do you look at that opportunistically? And if CapEx is going to go up, do the share repurchases slow then? J. Wes Frye : No, not at all. I think we have a strong organization structure that we will do both. And keep in mind we are in fact doing both. We have repurchased just under 28 million of shares since its effective date in December currently and that\u2019s on the \u2013 even though we\u2019ve indicated 460 million of CapEx. So we will still be both, executing and investing in growth in terms of our network, et cetera, and while also looking at returning proceeds to shareholders in terms of repurchase. So I think our balance sheet, our structure, our profitability and margins allow us to do both, and we\u2019ll continue to look at that. Todd Fowler : Okay, that helps. And then, Wes, just maybe a follow up for you. The insurance and claims here in the quarter, do you view that as kind of a normal rate for the first quarter? Was there anything that was elevated? And how do we think about that going forward? It\u2019s a good number. I was just curious if you viewed that as being normal for the first quarter. J. Wes Frye : Yes, we\u2019ve seen that \u2013 that\u2019s fairly normal and that includes our DIPD coverage in that line as well as our cargo claims. We\u2019ve been very active in managing both of those expenses and we are continuing to see that as being a positive number whether it goes down or up as a percent of revenue. As we pointed out in our script, the optics of that isn\u2019t as much as you think since -- David S. Congdon: We showed it going from 1.3% to 1.4%. But if the revenue is down because of the fuel surcharge, the number is actually better as a percent of our fuel surcharge revenue. J. Wes Frye : That\u2019s a good point. I\u2019d say probably it\u2019s more flattish, but I think that\u2019s a range we expect to maintain this year. Todd Fowler : Yes, and that\u2019s why I framed up the question the way I did because I think it\u2019s optically a little bit confusing, so I just wanted to get your thoughts on how insurance felt during the quarter. So I think I got what I need with that. Thanks for the time this morning. J. Wes Frye : Thanks, Todd. Operator : Next, we move to David Ross with Stifel. David Ross : Good morning, gentlemen. David S. Congdon: Good morning, David. David Ross : There\u2019s been a lot of M&A activity in the 3PL landscape and you talked about having a good amount of your business moving through the 3PL network. Can you talk about any impact you\u2019ve seen from consolidation of the larger brokers on the business or how you see that playing out in the marketplace? David S. Congdon: David, I don\u2019t think \u2013 as far as we\u2019re concerned, we\u2019ve not seen any affect on our relationships with the 3PLs that we do business with. Our stance on how we work with 3PLs will remain the same and we\u2019ve had successful relationships with 3PLs. David Ross : And then just on the equipment side, you guys spending over 270 million this year. Anything different in what you\u2019re buying versus prior years in terms of new specs for the tractors, different brands or OEMs, different engine types, anything there that\u2019s changing? David S. Congdon: Our mix of brands is the same this year as it has been the last couple of years from the tractor standpoint, trailers are about the same. There\u2019s nothing in particular different in any major way; mix of engines and the whole thing it\u2019s all about the same. We\u2019ve testing some automatic transmissions or what they call it, semiautomatic transmissions, but we\u2019re not \u2013 haven\u2019t moved ahead with anything in a big way on that. David Ross : Have you guys looked into nat gas trucks at all for any of the P&D routes? What\u2019s your current thinking there? David S. Congdon: We\u2019ve been watching the whole natural gas evolution for the last several years and we are definitely on a wait and see approach. We don\u2019t think that [indiscernible] we\u2019re ready for that or that\u2019s ready for us. Earl E. Congdon: Keep in mind, David, that our tractors that are used in the P&D routes were previously line haul tractors as we get the 10-year economic life, so we do not buy a separate pickup and delivery fleet, so that makes it a little more cumbersome to try. And in line haul, clearly, natural gas just isn\u2019t even close to being practical for us as I assume for the industry. David Ross : Excellent. Thank you very much. Operator : Next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. David S. Congdon: Good morning. Scott Group : So, I wanted to ask about the impact of fuel and from a couple sides here, do you have a kind of an estimate on how it may have hurt the operating income or not in the quarter, and how you think it might impact second quarter? And then just separately on fuels, since you guys didn\u2019t change the fuel surcharge or I don\u2019t think you changed the fuel surcharge, have you heard from customers that that\u2019s been an impact in terms of incremental market share gains for you? J. Wes Frye : On your first question, yes, we did realize a little bit tailwind in the first quarter, maybe 20 to 30 basis points on the fuel. We expect that to reverse to a slight headwind as the year progresses and as fuel cost starts to go up, and fuel surcharge perhaps lags that a little bit. So that was our current. What was your other question, Scott? David S. Congdon: About the surcharge and the customers, we have not had obviously not a lot of direct feedback nor any way to really measure whether our stance of not taking the increases on our fuel surcharge tables, whether that has contributed to market share gains we really have not \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to measure that. I would just say that our 559, which is where that was reflected saw pretty nice growth in the first quarter. J. Wes Frye : And not necessarily above what would be the overall, it\u2019s hard to make a conclusion that we got additional, but we still think that was the fair thing for us and the right thing for us to do. Scott Group : No, that makes sense. And then I know there were a bunch of questions already on headcount, but I don\u2019t think I heard \u2013 did you give an estimate of what headcount is going to be up in the second quarter? J. Wes Frye : We have not given that guidance. Scott Group : Okay. And that\u2019s not something you want to share with us? J. Wes Frye : Right. Scott Group : Okay. And then one last thing, just how does lower weight per shipment impact incremental margin? We understand the impact on revenue per hundredweight, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m clear on how it impacts incremental margins? J. Wes Frye : Well, we had a lower weight per shipment in the first quarter and I think our incremental margin was 30%. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you. Earl E. Congdon: If you think about that versus overall yield and density across the network, I think yield and density across the network were more influential to our 200 basis point improvement in OR. It would have maybe a slight negative effect on the incremental margin in that. We do haul shipments. So we\u2019re hauling more shipments, which means that you got more movement on that, but the impact would have been minimal. As David points out, the real question is are you getting appropriately compensated in terms of yields. And certainly we have and expect to. Scott Group : Okay, helpful guys. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We next move to Tom Albrecht with BB&T. Thomas Albrecht : Hi, guys. Good morning. David S. Congdon: Good morning. Thomas Albrecht : Just with how weird this economy is and that, I\u2019m just kind of wondering if you\u2019ve had any major shifts in kind of the breakdown between your overnight, second day and third day deliveries? I kind of look at it as about 30% overnight, 40% second day, and 30% third day or later but it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve asked you about that? J. Wes Frye : It\u2019s been relatively constant although our overnight and second day is growing perhaps slightly more than our longer haul, and that\u2019s kind of been the trend. But other than that, we haven\u2019t seen any sudden or significant shifts in that. Thomas Albrecht : Okay. And then, David, on the issue of the 33-foot trailers, do you have some thoughts on either age or mileage where you would use a trailer kit to expand the length of the trailer versus buying brand new 33 footers? David S. Congdon: We are keeping our trailers, our pup trailers in the range of \u2013 I think it\u2019s 18 to 20 years. Is that about right, Wes? J. Wes Frye : Yes. David S. Congdon: And so I think you would probably only make a conversion if they were less than 10 years old would be my \u2013 that\u2019s just my educated guess right now. Thomas Albrecht : Okay. Obviously if it gets past, you\u2019ll study it a little bit more. The other thing kind of back to the headcount, would it be fair to sort of extrapolate that there\u2019s a good chance your headcount will actually lag your tonnage growth in the second quarter, just because you already did so much advance hiring? J. Wes Frye : It could go either way. Thomas Albrecht : Okay. And you\u2019re still actively hiring quite a bit it sounds like then at least at the beginning of the quarter. David S. Congdon: And even at a \u2013 sequentially, our tonnage will be obviously higher in the second quarter than the first, and year-over-year we\u2019ve only discussed 9% to 10% tonnage growth. And even more shipments growth. Keep in mind that probably the more comparable metric is number of shipments growth with respect to employees not tonnage growth, because we actually move shipments not necessarily tonnage. So we anticipate with the tonnage growth that the shipment growth will be higher, and that means we got to have the people in place to move it. So we would definitely be hiring people during the second quarter because June will be another peak month, just like March is the peak month to the first quarter; June is the peak month to the second quarter. And we\u2019ve got to be getting geared up to be able to handle the volumes in June. And then we hope everybody takes a little bit of a vacation in July and then here we go again in the peak in September. Thomas Albrecht : Last question, just on a typical week or month, however you might look at it, approximately what percentage of your shipments are being run through a freight dimensioner [ph]? J. Wes Frye : Keep in mind we don\u2019t \u2013 the percentage isn\u2019t necessary relevant. I mean if you\u2019ve got a customer and you need to run \u2013 say it\u2019s a new customer. You only get a sampling of that shipment to see if the cube and the weight per cube is what was agreed on from a pricing standpoint. If I had to guess, I would say 30% to 40% of our shipments go through a dimensioner on a daily basis. Thomas Albrecht : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : Next question comes from David Campbell with Thompson, Davis & Company. David Campbell : Wes, you \u2013 thanks for taking my question. You said earlier that your next day business is up a little more than the long haul business. Does that mean expedited, your expedited shipments are going faster than your overall business? J. Wes Frye : Well, keep in mind expedited doesn\u2019t necessarily mean next day. Expedited is expedite regardless of the length of haul. If we have a customer that needs a shipment going from the East Coast to West Coast, that\u2019s expedited but that\u2019s not necessarily has anything to do with the transit time is with the immediacy of the shipment. So that wouldn\u2019t necessarily be the reason why our next day shipments as a percent of overall is increasing. It\u2019s just \u2013 one of the things, it isn\u2019t continued growth in our regional obviously business, but it\u2019s not necessarily expedited. David Campbell : Right. So is expedited increasing about the same as your overall business or faster? J. Wes Frye : Faster. David Campbell : Faster. And is that any change or that\u2019s \u2013 it seems like in the past, it hadn\u2019t grown faster but maybe it has. David S. Congdon: Yes, it has. J. Wes Frye : Yes, it has and I\u2019m not sure how you know that number, because we don\u2019t disclose that amount of detail. David Campbell : Just guessing. David S. Congdon: It\u2019s coming off a lower pace of revenue too, so that\u2019s why the percentage of growth might be faster. David Campbell : All right, thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Benjamin Hartford : Hi. Good morning, guys. Wes, can you remind us what type of sensitivity do you have to the 15% to 20% long-term incremental margins that you\u2019ve guided to, specifically on the bottom end? What is the bottom end of that incremental margin target assume from a core pricing standpoint? And is the bigger risk to falling below that long-term incremental margin target range, is it core price or is it continued productivity gains? J. Wes Frye : I think as long as the macro is in place doing okay, as long as we see continued discipline from a pricing standpoint and assuming that we still have the density improvements, all of which we think is the case, there\u2019s no reason why our incremental margin will be definitely at the high end range. And of course it\u2019s been above that with those ingredients in place. For it to get to the low range, I think we will have to pursue all of those things having a negative effect and therefore just not doing well, and that\u2019s for you and the economists to decide if that ever happens. But that would be the reason why it would ever get down to the low end of that range would be because of those factors for it being not positive. Benjamin Hartford : Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, with no further questions in queue at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Congdon for closing remarks. Earl E. Congdon: Well, as always, thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and your support of Old Dominion. Feel free to call us if you have any further questions. Thank you and good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great rest of your day.",

Please go ahead, sir. David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter conference call. With me this morning is Wes Frye, our CFO and Adam Satterfield, our Vice President and Treasurer. After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion continued its record setting pace during the second quarter of 2015 achieving our best quarterly results for revenue, operating ratio and earnings per diluted share. We achieved these results despite reduced fuel surcharge revenue and a second consecutive quarter in which weight per shipment declined. Nevertheless, the growth in shipments and tons per day for the quarter increased our freight density and a stable pricing environment supported a 5.3% increase in revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharge. Our record operating ratio of 81.5 represents the fifth consecutive quarterly improvement in our OR of 100 basis points or better. Also our OR has now improved for 21 of the past 22 quarters. These consistent improvements in OR have also driven our double-digit growth in earnings per diluted share for the same 21 quarters as evidenced by our 16.3% increase to $1 for our second quarter completed. Old Dominion continued to operate at a high level for the second quarter. Even with 13.4% growth in shipments for the quarter, we again provided an on-time delivery ratio of over 99% and a cargo claim ratio of just 0.33%. We also responded well to the increase in LTL shipments with relatively strong improvements in our productivity metrics for P&D shipments per hour and platform shipments per hour, while other productivity metrics, such as platform pounds per hour and line haul laden (3:46) load average were pressured by the 3.8% decrease in LTL weight per shipment. To ensure capacity in a capacity constrained industry, we are continuing our long-term strategy of differentiating Old Dominion through consistent and sizable investment in our infrastructure, equipment and technology. We also continue to invest in the training and education of our Old Dominion family of employees to optimally leverage our capital investment. We continue to focus on price discipline to ensure an appropriate return on each account. As a result, we have created the strongest financial position that the company has ever experienced, which enables the investment required to sustain the service standards that set us apart in our industry. Many factors have contributed to Old Dominion's long-term performance, but the overriding key continues to be our successful delivery of on-time claims-free service at a fair price. Our performance record reflects the growing demand in the marketplace for this value proposition and we believe that we stand alone in our ability to deliver the high service standards it requires. We expect our strong competitive market position to enable us to further increase our market share, earnings and shareholder value. Thanks for joining us today and your interest in Old Dominion. And now Wes will review our results for the second quarter in greater detail. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, David, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue was $762.2 million for the second quarter, an increase of 8.4% from $703 million for the second quarter of 2014. Our operating ratio improved 100 basis points to an 81.5 for the second quarter and earnings per diluted share grew 16.3% to $1 from $0.86 for the second quarter of last year. Our financial results were driven by a 1.2% increase in LTL tonnage for the quarter, comprised primarily of a 13.4% increase in LTL shipments, a 3.8% decrease in LTL weight per shipment. LTL revenue per hundredweight decreased 0.8% for the quarter and revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharge increased 5.3%. Revenue per hundredweight was favorably affected by the decrease in weight per shipment, while the length of haul was relatively flat. On a monthly basis, LTL tonnage per day decreased sequentially by 1.1% for April and March, increased 3.3% for May and increased 1.6% for June. This performance compares with our 10-year average sequential month trends that show an increase of 0.9% for April, an increase of 4.2% for May and increase of 2.2% for June. On a comparable quarter basis, LTL tons per day increased 9.7% for April, 9.6% for May and 7.8% for June. These sequential results were undoubtedly (7:26) influenced by the reduction in the weight per shipment. Actually, the number of shipments for the quarter, number of shipments that is, was sequentially above the 10-year average trend. We believe the decline in our weight per shipment for the second consecutive quarter reflects, among other things, the increased number of truckload shipments split into LTL shipments last year as well as a reduced demand for customer products this year. In addition, we believe some customers are modifying their LTL shipping patterns to smaller, more frequent shipment, which is reflected in our higher shipment volume with reduced weight per shipment. Beginning this quarter, we will stop providing forward quarter estimates of year-over-year tons per day and revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharge. Instead we will provide a real-time estimate for the first month of the new quarter on the earnings call, as I will today for the prior quarter. We will also publicly update this information with actual results for the second month of the quarter, which will be released early in the third month. And we will report the full quarter results at the time of our normal release and call. Accordingly, with two workdays remaining in July, we expect LTL tons per day for July to increase approximately 8% versus 2014. Sequentially, this represents a 1% decrease in tons per day compared to June versus a 2.4% decrease for the 10-year average. Increased tons include a 13.6% increase in the number of shipments offset by a 5% decrease in the weight per shipment. Sequential 10-year average in tons per day for August and September, as a note, is 0.6% for August and July and 3.2% increase for September versus August. We also expect revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharge to increase approximately 4.7% for July. As a reminder, monthly year-over-year LTL tons per day increased during the third quarter of 2014 compared to 2013 by 18.8% for July, 19% for August, 18% for September, much (10:08) tougher in comparison. Third quarter of 2015 has the same number of working days as the third quarter of 2014. 100 basis point improvement in Old Dominion's operating ratio primarily reflected our increased freight density, longer yield and some improvements in productivity. A significant decline in fuel prices resulted in a 340 basis point reduction in operating supplies and expense. However, the decline in fuel prices also decreased our fuel surcharge revenue. As we saw last quarter, other expenses expressed as a percent of revenue were higher during the second quarter which is partially attributable to the lower denominator due to the decline in fuel surcharge revenue; for example, salary and wages and benefits increased 240 basis points, despite some gains in productivity and improvements in certain employee benefit expenses. Capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2015 were $159.1 million. We estimate CapEx for the full year of 2015 will total approximately $469.3 million, including land expenditures of $164.7 million for real estate, $277.8 million for tractors and trailers and other equipment and $26.8 million for technology and other assets. After anticipated asset sales, we expect total net CapEx of approximately $450 million, which we plan to fund primarily through operating cash flow as well as our available borrowing capacity, if necessary. For the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 407,000 shares of the company's common stock for $29.1 million under our previously authorized $200 million share repurchase program. Since the November 2014 announcement of our share repurchase program, we have purchased approximately 658,000 shares for $47.9 million. Effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 was 38.6% compared to 39% for the second quarter of 2014. At this point, we expect an effective tax rate of 38.6% for the third quarter of 2015. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. And, operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for any questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. And we will take the first question today from Alex Vecchio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi there. Wes, I just wanted to kind of get a little bit more color on the rationale behind removing quarterly guidance. It seems you guys have actually, had a fairly good track record with respect to kind of being reasonably close to what you've guided to. So I just wanted to get a little bit more color there. Is there more uncertainty this quarter than there has been in the past in terms of how trends might evolve going forward, or is there anything to read into that? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Well, I think, you said it. I think, with uncertainty in this economy that seems to go up and down, etcetera, we thought it would be better color just to give you actual numbers and at the same time, as I provided to you sequential trends of the 10-year average, which would help you forecast what the remaining quarter is. But we thought it was more instructive to give maybe a little more detail than we do just on those two guidance to give you some additional statistics as we update the quarter for obviously July of this conference call. And then August we'll submit an 8-K and update August and then... David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: As well as the actual for July, which, yes, as of today, we only have two days remaining. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Yes. David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, yes (14:39) J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : July actually turned out, right. (14:41) Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's true. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : So that's the rationale for us. Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That makes sense. And then, secondly, you mentioned there's the decline in the weight per shipment seems to be about, at least, partly a function of customers seeking to refine that to smaller and more frequent shipments. What do you \u2013 do you think this is a function of kind of the macro or what's kind of driving that change, do you think, and what are the implications for kind of your density and your ability to kind of expand margins to the extent you have in the past? Is this kind of a good thing, a bad thing, or neutral or how should we sort of think about that change in customer behavior if it continues, if you think it will continue? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Well, I'll say that those three reasons that I gave are a little bit anecdotal, although we actually talked to some of our top 50 national accounts about what they were seeing and why the weight per shipment they were seeing were less than they were last year and that was the three responses. And the biggest overriding response, maybe 30% to 40% of the responses were in fact because of lack of truckload capacity last year, they were diverting some loads and slipped them down into LTL. Second reason, they just said the macro is that our demand for our widgets are just a little bit less. And then the third one, they were citing the fact that we have just moved to a trend of more frequent shipments, but smaller. You know, all the things are -- I guess you could call it indirectly and directly macro oriented. Whether the smaller, more frequent shipment is a continuing trend, we'll just have to wait and see. It was the opposite back in 2009 where we saw larger, less frequent shipments combining. But the fact that our number of shipments \u2013 and I know some of it's market share, but it's still, in our view, a pretty good sign on the economy that we're still seeing a lot of velocity of shipments. As far as the weight per shipment, when we gave guidance of the 9.5 to 10.5, we were seeing pretty good sequential trends in June and then it just kind of fizzled out and the difference between the 9.1 that we reported and the 9.5 really isn't that much based on the thousands of shipments that we haul. In fact, it's like a 20 pound difference, which is about the weight of a bag of cat litter. So it sounds like it but it really is close and quite frankly, we expect June to build and it just didn't build up to expectation this year. But my commentary into July is our sequential is actually better than 10-year average and our growth in shipments is still very strong. Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great, thanks very much for the time. Operator : Next is Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, guys. Morning. So, Wes, just wanted to follow up on that last point. So it looks like when the monthly sequentials in the second quarter were maybe a little bit worse than the sequential average in terms of most of the months, but July now better. And what do you make of that? Is this a sign that the macro is starting to pick up a little bit again or do you think it just kind of like \u2013 it was an easy comp versus the second quarter, just curious on your thoughts on why July now is starting to feel better? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : I don't -- it feels better, but not great. I think it's still too early to see if we had any -- from our standpoint, any significant change in the macro. David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The weakness in the second quarter of volume trends per day was primarily related to the lower weight per shipment. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Right. David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And as Wes also pointed out in his commentary, our actual shipments per day trended greater than our 10-year sequential. So that's primarily the market share wins that we're having. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just your thoughts on the pricing environment overall. There's concern out there when you see several of the carriers with negative tonnage that at some point something is going to give and the pricing environment is going to start to be a little less rational. What's your outlook for pricing back half of this year, early views on next year? Are you seeing anything out there that gets you worried about pricing momentum? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : The only we worry we have is amnesia. (19:33) other carriers. But, honestly, we haven't seen a reaction to the negative tonnage yet. Time will tell whether we will or won't. But so far, it sounds like everyone is really focused on their yield management, as they should be. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, great. All right. Thank you, guys. Operator : Next up is Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Wes, can I trouble you to repeat the sequential trends for the third quarter? I just want to make sure I caught them now that you've changed the structure here. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, let me find it. The sequential trends for the second quarter... Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Third. David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The historical financials. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, the sequential trends for the third quarter on a 10-year average on tonnage would be \u2013 July would be 2.4% reduction, June. August is a 0.6% increase compared to July. And September is a 3.2% increase from August. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate you doing that. I guess when you think about the weight per shipment and what you're seeing there, I guess I wanted to sort of hone in a little bit on the 3PL business that you do. It's obviously a reasonably large piece of your business. Are there any differences between how you think about the growth in that business and what that may do to the weight per shipment relative to what's coming from your core customers? Just want to get a sense of how that stacks up. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : We treat our 3PLs from a profitability standpoint and it's obvious from our results that we do, as we would any. We don't look at the 3PL on its own, we look at the customers underneath that 3PL and we do the same pricing and analysis of their shipments that we would if it were direct. And that's what we base our pricing on, is to the individual customers underlying the 3PL business. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): But there's no meaningful mix difference relative to your regular book of customers? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Most of those are on contracts and we did see a lot of reduced weight per shipment among shippers within our 3PL group. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. That's helpful. That's what I was wondering. And then, I guess, sticking on that topic, when you think about that market, you guys have been very successful there. Are you seeing any increased level of competition among some of the other asset-based guys pushing into that market or trying to compete for some of that business? Just kind of curious how the dynamics of that specific market looks. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : We just don't have that visibility, Chris. David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No real change from the norm. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. Well, that's helpful. Thanks very much for the time, guys. I appreciate it. Operator : We'll now go to Brad Delco with Stephens. Brad Delco - Stephens, Inc.: Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. And, Wes, I think congrats on your upcoming retirement. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Brad Delco - Stephens, Inc.: Wes, wanted to ask you maybe a broader question on the industry and whether or not you think the LTL industry as a whole and, Dave, this may be for you as well, is prepared for upcoming electronic logs in the truckload industry. And I'm trying to figure out, do you think the LTL industry is prepared for tightening capacity in using third-party line haul? And obviously you guys would be in a unique position there. So just curious in your opinion how that's going to play out for you going forward. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Brad, I'll try to answer all that. First of all, as far as we're concerned, we implemented onboard recorders and electronic almost five years ago. So that's not going to be any major factor as far as we're concerned. As far as the truckload industry is concerned, most of the large truckload carriers already have the electronic logs. I think it's going to primarily affect the smaller LTL fleets, where it may cause some capacity to come out from the smaller fleets. So, is the LTL industry or are we in particular prepared for tightened capacity, especially from line haul \u2013 you mentioned line haul. We don't do any line haul with purchase transportation to speak of. We just occasionally, for balance purposes, but it's a very small part of our line haul. So we don't see that as a problem for us. Some other carriers who rely on purchase transportation line haul might see \u2013 you need to ask them what their plan is. That is not going to affect us. Brad Delco - Stephens, Inc.: Yes, that's exactly kind of where I was going. My thought was, you'd see purchase transportation costs go up for LTLs that rely on third-party line haul, but because you do most of it yourself, or if not all of it yourself, you won't see that as a headwind, but you may benefit from what happens with industry pricing in that event? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Yes. I think that's probably a fair guess on your part. Brad Delco - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. All right, guys. That's it for me. Thanks for the time. Operator : And Allison Landry with Credit Suisse is next. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. So, sort of another question on pricing. So, last quarter you indicated that core price ex all of the noise from fuel and mix was about 5%. Was that tracking at a similar pace in the second quarter? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Allison, could you repeat the question? I was diverted doing something else. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Sure. So during the first quarter, you had talked about a core pricing number, which, exclusive of fuel and the impact from weight per shipment and length of haul, that figure was about 5%. So, I was wondering if that was similar in the second quarter? David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's for length of haul... J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Adjusted for length of haul, maybe a little bit lower than the first quarter. But on the other hand, in the first quarter overall we had the (26:46) business and that was lapped in the second quarter, so that would explain some of that reduction, but I can say that pricing, just anecdotal feedback from our pricing people, we are successful in getting increased rates from our national accounts anywhere from 3% to 5% and that's on a very fairly consistent basis. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And on the productivity side, I know that you were expecting some incremental improvement on several metrics. Maybe if you could run through some of those in the quarter that would be helpful. Thanks. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : We got good productivity increases. If you look at productivity in David's comments in shipments per hour and in platform per hour, with the large increase in the number of shipments that we had 13.4%, typically that would result in more labor to move those as opposed to a shipment that's heavier. In our case, it was a positive because what we saw was, is a lot of those increased shipments were from an increased number of multiple shippers. In other words, that was shippers that we picked up multiple shipments from, in fact, we had 6% increase in the number of multiple shippers. And within those multiple shippers, we also had an increase in the number of shipments that they tendered to us by 7.5%. So those two things are getting leveraged on -- and on that \u2013 from a density standpoint, on those increased number of shipments. And that's why we were seeing productivity in the shipments per hour, both on platform and dock. Now, in the pounds per hours, David also mentioned that was influenced by the fact that weight per shipment was down 3.8%, but the more -- I mean, after all, we do hold shipments, not necessarily weight and that was a positive sign from our \u2013 and helped us in the second quarter. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up, was there \u2013 in terms of the trends that you just mentioned with increase in the number of shippers and the shipments that they're moving, is there any specific end market that you saw more or less of this in like for example, retail versus manufacturing? David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Not really, Allison. That's pretty much across the board where we're seeing this growth in multiple shippers, multiple - Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you. David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Operator : We'll go to Bob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Thanks. As a follow-up to Allison's question, could you give a little bit more color in terms of the multiple shipments that you are picking up? Are these going to kind of different warehouses or different distribution centers across the country? Or is it just kind of multiple shipments to the same store? I am just trying to get a better understanding of this mix that's going on between tonnage and shipment that's bifurcated. David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Multiple shipment shippers are usually shipping out of a distribution center going to their end customer. But we also track and look at multiple shipment consignees and how many shipments we deliver to a multiple shipment consignee. And we're seeing some growth in those areas as well, so \u2013 but it's more pronounced on the shipper side which is a clear indication to us of our winning additional market share. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Typically when we think about that growth in terms of shipments, it's a positive for the economy, yet the kind of feedback from customers is it's a little bit more macro. What do you think is going on with the shift to the breakdown in terms of the smaller shipment size? Is there something we should be reading more broadly in terms of from a supply chain standpoint, or from a macro with regard to this trend? David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we don't -- to be honest, we don't really know why it's happening and the anecdotal feedback has not given us much to go on there. But, is there more demand for just in time or are people ordering smaller shipments more frequently to keep their own inventory levels down, there may be some correlation with average inventory levels out there in the macro, but we haven't tried to draw that correlation. But that thought comes to my mind. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That makes sense. Wes, as a piece of clarification, were the shipment trends rough -- in terms of year-over-year growth rates roughly constant throughout the quarter? You had indicated I think they were up north of 13% in July. I was just curious if that trend was sequentially -- J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : They were, in April, it was up 13.4%, 13.6% in May and 13.2% in June. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect. Thanks so much, guys. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Next up is David Ross with Stifel. Please go ahead. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, David. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Morning. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: As you continue to grow and add personnel to handle the increased shipment volume, are you seeing any pinches in terms of driver availability or any driver wage pressure that could cause rates to go up more than average this year? David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We've been pretty successful finding drivers. I mean, we've got some tight markets, David. But in general, we've been able to fill the positions that we've had. And from a wage standpoint, we're not seeing any pressure that our wages are out of line. Actually, they're pretty much up at the -- pretty close to the top of the industry most everywhere that we operate. So, no real problems there. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then just a little knit \u2013 Wes, the other expense line item on the income statement, what was driving that? And is that more kind of a one-time issue rather than anything that should be --? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Not necessarily. In that number is bad debts and consulting fees. We were -- in our modernization, in converting to the local platforms at the start-ups, especially during last year, we were using some consultants, and that was going -- some of that was going through that line. And as that rolls out, those are not less, but are starting to get capitalized, they start to develop. So that's probably one of the big reasons of that reduction. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So that should maybe continue at a few hundred thousand a quarter for the next few quarters as you roll this out? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Right. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : You're welcome. Operator : And we'll go to Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, and thanks for your time. I wanted to ask, where is your market share today? And it doesn't seem like there's anything that's going to really impede your share growth. But I'm wondering, what are some of the risks that we should be mindful of? David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It depends on whose denominator you use for the market share, but if you use an ATA number that's up in the $45 billion to $50 billion category, we're at about 7% of that. And then if you use some of other databases and maybe $37 million (sic) [$37 billion] (34:50) market, we are always there, we ask about 8.5% J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : 8%. David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, I didn't quite understand the question. Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. So what I was basically driving at is that, I know that you're aiming to hit the double-digit share, and it doesn't look like there's anything that's going to impede that based on what we're hearing from your competitors. And so I'm just wondering, is there anything that we should be mindful of or is the runway here really pretty straightforward? David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We are delivering a really strong value proposition in the marketplace and a strong service value to the market. And the customers are recognizing this and they are continuing to reward us with additional business and lanes and so forth, and we're winning new customers as well because of the service value that we deliver. And so, as long as we're perceived by the marketplace as delivering superior service value, we think that we can continue winning share. Adam N. Satterfield - Treasurer & Vice President : The other component to that is making sure we've got the capacity to be able to grow into, and I think you're seeing the -- we've made the significant investments to ensure that we've got the service center capacity as well as on the equipment side as well. David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good point, Adam. Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.: No doubt. I mean \u2013 yes, I mean, no doubt. I mean, it's impressive that you guys continue to reinvest at such profitable rates of return. Just with regard to the some of the comments around the weight per shipment shifts. Is there really a material difference, when we're talking about, let's say, for example, shifts between your B to C versus your B to B customers? David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Not, not really. Just keep in mind on the weight per shipment, when you go -- when you take 2015 weight per shipment, they compare that to 2013, it's kind of in line. So we just have an unusual last year with the splits of the truckload into LTL. Now, that's not to say that won't happen again because some of those capacity issues I think are still looming on the truckload market. But it's not as if the weight per shipment this year is a trend forever. It's kind of in line with what was normal prior to that. So we'll just see how that goes. Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : And we'll go to Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. David, I know you've been asked this when you guys were at 84% OR, 83% OR, 82% OR. But can you talk a little bit about now being in the 81% OR, your confidence in continuing to be able to show margin expansion? If I think about your longer-term incremental guidance of 15% to 20%, and all the freight coming into the network would be at a OR higher than where you're running here in the second quarter. So just kind of some high level thoughts on the ability to continue to expand the OR from where you're at right now? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Todd, I'm going to take part of that question, then David can jump in. Everyone focuses on incremental margin and we've given a range of 15% to 20% assuming that the macro is behaving, pricing is somewhat disciplined in the sector and we still have density improvements. And I want to make a comment on all this focus on incremental margin. The incremental margin, in other words, mathematically, the less percent that you grow, less improvement in OR it takes to get an incremental margin of, say, 30%. In other words, if you cut your growth in half, it takes half of the incremental improvement in OR to get that same OR incremental margin. So if someone reports an incremental margin of 30%, like we did in the second quarter, and our growth was 8%, if we grew at 16%, it would take a 200 basis point improvement in OR to get that same incremental margin. So going forward you need to consider that. And therefore, as we get larger and the percent of growth may drop, then it influences how much of that improvement in OR that you get to get to that incremental margin. So we still maintain 15% to 20%, given those three qualifications. And it's been stronger than that. But keep in mind, with those three things, more or less, we are confident we'll certainly get up to the 20%. Obviously that implies an 80% OR. So I think that's good. And of course, we are at 81.5% for the second quarter which typically is best, with the close second being the third quarter. But we've still got the full year and how we look at that. Anything to add, David, on that? David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. It's just all about density, all about yield discipline in the industry, have a little help from the economy is good and continuously improve your efficiencies, which we do that as well. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : So we could maintain the 30% OR if we just reduced our growth to, say, 3%, and improve our OR by a tenth of a basis point. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Well, I wasn't suggesting that. And I appreciate the help in thinking through it. It was more along the lines of in the environment that you're in, the things that you need to continue to show the margin improvement. And obviously it's a good problem to be comping up against. So all of that is helpful. The follow up I wanted to ask, Wes, and I'm not sure if you addressed this, but thinking about the OR sequentially into the third quarter, I think historically it's gone up by about 50 basis points or so. What are the things we should be thinking about second quarter versus third quarter in 2015 that could make the OR change either greater or worse than what we've seen historically? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : The third quarter historically always includes a wage increase and just the normal sequential things. I think the last year, we had a 50 basis point increase in the OR in the third quarter compared to the second, but we had about $3 million gain on real estate in the second quarter of 2014 that didn't repeat itself. So you've got all these moving parts that can influence either quarter. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: But I guess in 2015 specifically, you have the wage increase every year. I mean, was there anything maybe in 2Q that was a fuel benefit or anything like that? I think you mentioned to one of the earlier questions about the operating expenses, but there's nothing \u2013 or is there anything else, I guess, that we should be thinking about third quarter from second quarter that would be dramatically different than what we've seen historically? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Not offhand. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the time this morning, guys. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll go to John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Thank you, guys, for taking my question. First, Wes, your comments around just the shift towards smaller but more frequent shipments and having to take a wait and see approach, from an operations and planning perspective, is there much you have to do? I mean, if this becomes a more consistent trend and you see this as the new norm, what are the major changes you have to make in operations? Is it just the labor side, more personnel to handle the increase in shipments, or is there something else you have to do? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : John, I want to be clear. When we got feedback from the shippers, that was one of the reasons, and that was the last of the three reasons, that were cited. I don't want to give the impression that that's a clear trend that's going to apply materially. That was just one of the reasons. And when I said wait and see, we'll have to see if that's for some reason will be a continuing trend, an increasing trend or become just kind of neutral. We'll just have to wait and see. But obviously we'll gear up for whatever happens. David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right. And from an operations or planning perspective, there are no major changes that have to be made if this is some kind of ongoing trend. It's just you're handling slightly less heavy pallets, but you still have to move them across the dock the same way you always have. John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. All right, all right. That's what I was looking for. And then, going back to the conversation about the OR, can you talk a little bit about how you balance \u2013 I know you want margin improvement, but obviously you still view yourselves very much of a growth company. If you think about taking that market share, whatever it is today and say you take it 1.5, two points, three points higher and you continue to take on that share, how wed are you to, I've got to have margin improvement as I do this? Because there is going to investment that needs to be made, so how do you balance those two, that pursuit of growth versus, where \u2013 do you let the OR kind of shake out where it does as you gain that density and all, or is it, hey, I've got to pay attention to both the growth and where that OR shakes out? David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We pay attention to both all the time, because we focus on every account to reach a targeted operating ratio. And it's never been our practice to trade off growth for less margin or cheaper prices. We don't -- that's not the way we think. But \u2013 so, we will \u2013 we've been on the right course, as you can see from our numbers and our performance. And we're going to stay on the course we're on with the yield management philosophies that we have and with the service product that we've been building, and \u2013 but we're not going to \u2013 you won't see us sort of trading off our margin to try to get growth. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : John, here's the deal and it's probably unlike most of the other LTL carriers. First of all, we price the shipments to be profitable to us. That's the key. And, of course, to do that, you need to have accurate costing to do that, and then if we see that our growth is more than anticipated, instead of trying to, quote, call some freight out to match that capacity, we simply invest in more capacity. And that's why you see our CapEx continuing to go up. And why do we do that? And the big answer is because we can, we have the margins, we have the return on investment capital that can \u2013 that gives us the power to do that. And that's \u2013 as David pointed out, that's what we'll continue to do. David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And with this continued growth in our CapEx and our investing in the company, all of the costs of those investments is embedded in the 81.5 operating ratio. Another thing to think about is that, we have really fine-tuned operations in this company and we are very efficient. Otherwise, we would not be operating at 81.5. And so, when we go to price an account, because we're so efficient, the price that we charge is fair and perceived as a darn good value in the market, because we don't have to charge as much as somebody else that doesn't operate as efficiently but \u2013 and still achieve the results we are looking for. John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Very good, very good. Wes, because we can is probably the best answer I've heard this entire earnings season. So thanks for that. Thanks for taking the questions. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, John. Operator : We'll go to Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC: Hi, guys. Good morning. At this stage of the call, just one quick one from me. If the log situation starts tightening up truckload capacity again, how should we start looking at LTL pricing? Could it take an upwards turn again? Or do you think we will just maintain sort of where we're at? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : The LTL capacity is \u2013 aside from our sales, we have more capacity than any other LTL out there. But generally LTL capacity is fairly balanced right now or perhaps tight. And so if the electronic logs cause field (47:52) capacity to tighten and freight comes the way of the LTL carriers in general, you would think that pricing would be more positive than it is now should we see more volume come in the way of LTL. One other point that we failed to mention earlier, talking about these electronic logs, is the effect that they may have on the overall owner-operator truckload market. We think that EOBRs are going to really put a squeeze on the owner-operators. They're pretty well squeezed as we speak, and it's going to put more of a squeeze, which reduces some truckload capacity out there. Personally, I don't know what percentage of truckload is hauled by owner-operators this day and age but that's going to be a squeeze, unless of course you're a big -- maybe a big company that already uses them with the owner-operators. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thanks for the color, guys. Operator : We'll go to Ben Hartford with Baird. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, Wes, real quick follow-up question on gains on sale this quarter. What is the number, and is there a way to allow us to think about what gains on sales should be through the balance of the year? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Hard to tell what the balance of the year. This quarter, it was about $1.6 million. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : And we'll go to David Campbell with Thompson, Davis & Company. David P. Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Co.: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask, if you could give me the number of employees on June 30 versus March 30? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Total full-time employees was 17,319 at the end of the quarter. David P. Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Co.: Okay. And March was what? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : The end of March we had 16,835. David P. Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Co.: Okay. Thanks. One \u2013 my second question is do you have last year's sequential tonnage gains for July, August, and September? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Yes. I gave them to you. I did... David P. Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Co.: You gave us \u2013 you gave us last year. Yes, you did. I got them. Or yeah, I got them, I got them. I didn't get September. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : September sequential \u2013 the 10-year average for sequential in September for tonnage is 3.2% over August. David P. Campbell - Thompson, Davis & Co.: Oh, yes, yes, okay, I got it. I'm sorry. I got it. Yes, I got it. Thank you for your help. I really appreciate it. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Okay. All right, David. Operator : And we'll go to Willard Milby with BB&T Capital Markets. Willard P. Milby - BB&T Capital Markets : Hi. Good morning, guys. Real quick on the, I guess, gains on sales show up in that miscellaneous expenses, is that correct? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Willard P. Milby - BB&T Capital Markets : And we've kind of been developing a trend the past couple of quarters with Q2 being the low mark for the year for miscellaneous expenses. Is that a trend we can expect to continue 2016/2017? Or is the past three years kind of unique with sales and just timing? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Well, we don't give that guidance and right now to the extent that gains have been there, it's hard to project what those will be. David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sometimes, we have a large real estate gain just because, we sold a big service center and, we always have some equipment disposals coming and going, but it varies a lot. Willard P. Milby - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. I was just curious if there was something special about Q2. I mean, it's kind of been that way for the past three years. J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Yes. We've been very consistently selling some excess real estate that was there because of investments in larger -- in facilities as part of our growth. Willard P. Milby - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. Fair enough. That's all I had. Thanks for the (52:03) time. Operator : And we'll go back to Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, guys, thanks for the follow-up. Wes, just one quick thing. Now that you're giving us the monthly revenue per hundredweight, do you have what yields growth net of fuel was by month in third quarter last year just so we can think about the comps? J. Wes Frye - Senior Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer : Scott, I don't have those offhand. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Maybe I'll follow up offline. Okay. Thank you. Operator : And at this time, I would like to turn the call back over to David Congdon for any additional or closing remarks. David S. Congdon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. As always, thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions. We appreciate your support of Old Dominion and feel free to give us a call if you have any further questions. Thank you and good day from all of us. Operator : Thank you very much. And that does conclude our conference for today. I'd like to thank everyone for your participation, and have a great day.",

Earl Congdon : Good morning and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. With me this morning are David Congdon, Old Dominion's Vice Chairman and CEO, Wes Frye, our CFO and Adam Satterfield, our Vice President and Treasurer. After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. I am pleased to report that Old Dominion produced very solid financial performance for the third quarter of 2015, including a 90 basis points improvement in our operating ratio to a third quarter company record of 82.1%, that contributed to a 10% increase in our earnings per diluted share. [Over our tonnage] slow this quarter from it double digit phase for the first half of the year reflecting an uncertain economic environment that has affected the entire industry. This quarter is being compared against the third quarter of last year when tons increased 18.7%, a 12 year-over-year comparison. Despite these headwinds Old Dominion continued to win market share for the quarter and we experienced double digit growth in shipments for the seventh consecutive quarter. The released result is further evidence that our progress of on time [claims] free deliveries only differentiates Old Dominion from our competitors and continues to resonate favorably in the market. Even with our strong 11.7% growth in shipments during the third quarter our on time service was 99% and our cargo claims ratio was 0.35%. That customer's value underpinned only superior service, we continue to achieve our yield objectives with revenues per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharge for the third quarter increasing 5.2%. As always our successful long term execution of our value proposition depends on the tremendous commitment and hard work of our dedicated employees. We will continue to invest in the equipment, infrastructure and technology as well as the training and continuing education that supports our industry leading team and their efforts to consistently produce superior performance. Thanks for your support of Old Dominion and now here is David Congdon. David Congdon : Good morning, let me begin by saying that I too am pleased about the company's performance for the third quarter. Our business model which we have been refining for nearly two decades now is built around an innovative and flexible team of people, providing superior service at a fair price. We continue to invest significantly in the company to execute with discipline and to strengthen our customer focused culture. We are fully committed to certain strengthen our market differentiation through consistent and sizeable investments in the resources, training and education that our employees need to exceed our customer's expectation. By doing this we can also continue to focus on yield management to ensure every account has an persuade return on that investment. While we are actively returning capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases, we are also committed to maintaining the balance sheet strength required to support the investments in the equipment, real estate and technology that is necessary to provide our customers with the superior service they expect and depend on. With ongoing execution we expect this commitment to enable us to continue to deliver on our unique value proposition and continue to outperform the industry. We remain confident in our ability to produce further long term gains in market share, earnings and shareholder value. Thanks for joining us today and now let's move to view our financial results for the third quarter in greater detail. Wes Frye : Thank you David good morning. For the third quarter of 2015 Old Dominion's revenue was 779.5 million, that's an increase of 4.8% from 743.6 million from the third quarter of 2014. Our operating ratio improved to an 82.1 for the third quarter from an 83.0 last year and earnings per diluted share increased 10% to $0.99 from $0.90 in the third quarter of last year.  Revenues for the third quarter reflect a 6.6% increase in LTL tonnage which was comprised primarily of 11.7% increase in LTL shipments a 4.6% decrease in LTL weight per shipment. LTL revenue per hundredweight decreased 1.6% for the quarter primarily due to reduction in the fuel surcharge. Revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharge increased 5.2%, declining weight per shipment for the quarter had a positive impact on the revenue per hundredweight somewhat offset by a small decline in [indiscernible]. On a monthly basis LTL tons per day decreased sequentially by 1.2% for July from June increase slightly by one tenth or 1% for August and increased 3.4% for September. This performance compares to our ten year average sequential month trends that show a decrease of 2.4% for July, an increase of 0.6% for August that's six tenths of 1% and an increase of 3.2% for September. So on average sequential trends was slightly higher during the quarter when compare to our 10 year average. On the compatible quarter-over-quarter basis LTL counts per day increased 7.7% for July 5.8% for August as previously announced and 6.4% for September. Impair able quarter growth in shipments for July, August and September were 12.9%, 11.7% and 10.7% and 10.7% respectively. While our weight per shipment declined 4.6%, 5.3% and 3.9% for the same months. We've now had three sequential quarters and a decline in weight per shipment which we believe is driven by several factors including the truckload capacity challenge during the third quarter of 2014 as resulted in additional courage migrating to LTL carriers that was not repeated in 2015. Also customers modifying their LTL shipment patterns to smaller, more frequent shipments and also as well by the softness in the economy. Looking to the fourth quarter we expect LTL accounts per day for October to increase approximately 4.1% versus 2014. Sequentially this represent a 4.4% decrease in tons per day compared to September versus a 2.8% decrease for the 10 year average. The increased tons include approximately a 10% increase in the number of shipments offset by 5% decrease in the weight per shipment. Sequential ten year average and accounts per day in November and December is 3% increase and an 8.7% decrease respectively.  We also expect revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharge to increase 5.5% for October. With the fourth quarter we will again face tough comparison versus last year, monthly year-over-year LTL tonnage per day increased during the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 2013 by 20.8% for October, 20.6% for November and 18.5% in December.  Fourth quarter of 2015 has the same number of word days as of fourth quarter of 2014. As David discussed the 90 basis points improvement in Old Dominion's operating ratio primarily reflected our increased freight density on the yield as well as some improvements in productivity. While a significant decline in fuel prices affected our revenues to a reduced fuel surcharge it also resulted in a 316 point reduction in operating supplies and expense. Another expenses expressed as a percent of revenue were higher during the quarter which was partially attributable to a lower denominator due to the decline in fuel surcharge revenue.  Salary, wages and benefit expense also reflected the partial quarter impact of a 3.5% increase in wages beginning in September as well as an increased use of company old equipment and employees in the lieu of rail service.  Capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2015 were $130.8 million. Now estimated CapEx for the entire year of 2015 will total approximately $451 million, including land expenditures of $139 million for real estate, $278 million for tractors, trailers and other equipment and $34 million for technology and other assets. After anticipated asset sales, we expect total net CapEx of approximately $431 million, a preliminary CapEx investment for 2016 should be in the range of 430 million to 460 million. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 was 38.4% compared with 37.1% for the third quarter of 2014. We expect an effective tax rate of 38.6% for the fourth quarter of 2015. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. And, operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for any questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Rob Salmon : I guess there's been a lot of talk with investors about the LTL pricing environment, given some concerns from some competitor's statements, looks like the yield net of fuel was pretty solid in the month of October as well. Can you give us a sense of what your contractual renewals trended last quarter as well as your thoughts about to generate increase, I don't think I have seen one kind of hit the wires yet but just kind of curious how you're thinking about that? David Congdon : Rob, it looks like it's about 3.5% to 4% is what we're seeing on the contractual. Rob Salmon : And how does that compare to what you saw in Q3? David Congdon : Yes, it's very comparable. Rob Salmon : If I can shift over to the weight per shipment, it looks like that declined sequentially in the third quarter I'm curious David what you think the drivers were there, because typically the weight per shipment decline I would expect to see an acceleration of the shipment growth because people are moving down to smaller shipments, it doesn\u2019t look like that played out, is this just kind of the business mix shifting more towards retail and a little bit away from some of the traditional manufacturing LTL shipments or any color whether that's just economic related or kind of business mix that you think's driving them? David Congdon : Wes made comments -- made some comments about that the comparison to last year, there was some fall off from the truckload [peers] last year that we're not experiencing this year that has affected the weight per shipment and then the general macro trends of the economy being little soft, shippers with -- their holders are smaller and they're shipping smaller orders more frequently that's what we're hearing from our sales force and the third point is we are obviously winning some market share and the new look at our overall length per shipment compared with our industry competitors, ours is heavier. So, if we are winning market share, we are winning smaller shipments which will also impact our weight per shipment slightly. Unidentified Company Representative : And Rob also, it's not unusual that the weight per shipment drops in the third quarter compared to the second, it did the same last year and it did the same year before and I think maybe that's because the seasonal moves start to tick up like as you had already mentioned retail starts to hasten a little bit as well which typically is a lower weight per shipment. Rob Salmon : That makes sense, I think we're also seeing some shift to LTL just given the elevated inventories that we saw show up in the Q3 report as well. But I'll leave it there, thanks so much. Operator : And we'll go next to the line of Alex Vecchio with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Alex Vecchio : David, can I ask for you that maybe talk a little bit more about the pricing environment for the industry as a whole, it sounds like you're still getting some solid rate increases here, but naturally we've heard, some other carriers that there's been a little bit of chinks in the armor if you will, some other carriers trying to get a little bit more aggressive on price, can you comment on what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint or do you concur that there are some other carriers out there may be getting a bit more aggressive or is that something you're not seeing at this point? David Congdon : Overall, we continue to feel that the pricing environment is stable, this is based on the feedback from our pricing department as well as our sales force, you will always have a pocket here or there of one tier or another may do something irrational or our [opinion perhaps stupid], which is nothing new. So, the way we see this still -- is still somewhat stable. We specifically tried to ask if what we heard this week from another carrier was truly about case and we just don't see it that way yet. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That's helpful commentary there. Switching gears to the operating ratio another good quarter here, typically I think in the fourth quarter, we see the OR road by about 150 basis points if we look historically on average, can we kind of -- how should we think about that this fourth quarter I know you don't give explicit guidance but maybe can you talk to some of the puts and takes that might be a little bit unusual this fourth quarter to the extent there are any and how we should think about that? David Congdon : You are right Alex, we don't give any guidance on the fourth quarter, so you will just have to take our story variance and make your own conclusions on that. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. All right, and then just one last one here if I could, your load factor was down about 5% in the third quarter and I realize that's partially a function of the weight per shipment declines but is this something that kind of we should be concerned about it all with respect to kind of the density in your network and it doesn\u2019t seem to have had a significant impact on your margins, you\u2019ve shown very solid margins but how should we just kind of interpret that data points specifically? David Congdon : I just want to reiterate the fact that our tonnage [lumping] which affects our [laid] load average, but keep in mind that we\u2019re still in double-digit growth on shipments, so in an area, in a [indiscernible] you wait for shipments drop, you kind of expect your laid note load average to drop as well simply because you just have lighter shipments. But on the other hand, if you look at our productivity in terms of shipments per hour shipments, shipments per stop, all those measures on shipments, it's still a part of the factor and resulted in part of our positive results for the quarter. So we still get positive results on shipment, if you look at in units instead of pounds. Operator : And we will go next to site of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Allison Landry : So I wanted to ask how does your market share strategy play out when industry does get competitive, I am thinking about your lower cost profile particularly relatively to where you guys were heading into the last downturn, is that for due additional flexibility to balance volumes versus price or should we take your earlier comments about irrational pricing behavior in the industry, as a clear indication that you won't deviate from your strategy of price discipline? David Congdon : Well, Allison I can assure you we are not going to deviate from our pricing discipline strategy and the notion of trading of price per volume or volume per price, is not in our vocabulary. Allison Landry : Got it, okay. And then as a follow-up question on the salaries and wages one, you gave that as a percent of sales sequentially it looks like it increased more than the historical average, I know that there is a wage increase, that was implemented but Q3 is typically when you do that, so just wondering if there is anything unusual there, or maybe if your headcount is a little bit elevated relative to the demand growth that you are expecting for the quarter? David Congdon : Yes, Allison I mentioned in my comments that a couple of reasons, one is mathematically, when you have less fuel surcharge, you would expect those cost, outside operating slight expense to increase as a percent of revenue and that's just mathematically one factor, another thing is when we were having in 2014, we were using a lot of rail up around the mid-west Pacific northwest with the service problem from the rail carriers of that time, we converted all that rail to company owned equipment and so part of that is converting and we had tremendous growth in that area also converting that is put to an increase in salary and wages, converting that to rail and you will notice it's all offset of purchase transportation is bound as well which reflects that offset. Secondly we have [indiscernible] operation that we\u2019re converting from lease operative model to a company owned driver model and so that has an effect as well. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to the site of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Your line is open. Jason Seidl : Hey Earl, David, Wes, Adam how are you guys? Quick question here, Wes, you went over a lot of numbers and when you were talking about the sequential shifts in tonnage you kind of lost me, could you repeat that for us? Wes Frye : I can\u2019t because I was lost too. Let`s go through that, so July our tonnage per day decreased by 1.2% from June. The 10-year average says that that he increase for July from June was 2.4%, so that was last in the sequential. For August we increased 0.1% that's one-tenth of 1% from July and the 10-year average is 0.6%. So that was a little less. For September we increased the tonnage from August 3.4% and the 10-year average is 3.2%, so that was above. So if you look at all that averages together on average our sequential trend was even [maybe] own part to slightly higher on what would be the 10-year average. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That\u2019s good, I just couldn\u2019t keep up with your [indiscernible] those numbers. Wes Frye : I guess still not slow enough. Unidentified Analyst : The weight per shipment not [indiscernible] is going to lap a clean comparison weight per shipment in another when is it not going to be impacted by the truckload business, it can be 1Q? Wes Frye : Yes, we were face with its truckload still over most of\u201914. So we won't really lap until we get into 2016 most likely. Unidentified Analyst : 2016, okay. Also in the quarter did your mix shift any more towards third-party logistics guys or has it been pretty stable? Wes Frye : Yes, I mean our percentage of revenue the third-party has been growing slightly than it did in the third quarter. But not by leaps and downs, but our ratio indicates that we're still getting good results and we have a very big relationship with 3PLs. Unidentified Analyst : Have you seen the 3PLs try to get more [rest] with you guys on bringing on board business? Wes Frye : Well, of course. But that\u2019s where the price discipline falls in, our added value. It really makes a comment there the 3PLs need to provide their customers with best in class service because they wanted to obviously to prevent turnover of their own customer base. So they realize that assets were important and the other thing is high level of service are important and they are willing to make sure that we are getting compensated sufficiently for that investment in the service that we provide. Operator : And next we will go to the side of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Your line is open. Chris Wetherbee : I wanted to just back on pricing for a second and just get a sense. Can you give us any sense of the benefit that weight per shipment adds to sort of corporate fuel surcharge. I don't know if it's any different, but is it a little bit lower with that, I guess I just want to try to make sure I understand some of dynamics going on within that pricing. Wes Frye : Was a question that the 5.2% is influenced by the reduction in weight per shipment but as David already point out, we are getting contractual business 3.5% to 4% of increases. So it\u2019s the net of that. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. So that's a reasonable proxy to use for sort of ex weight per shipment. Wes Frye : Right, it\u2019s reasonable. If you neutralize that difference in weight per shipment, we will still be showing some improvement. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it. Typically when you think about sort of economical freight cycles weight per shipment relative to tonnage, I guess how you think about it sort of leading that dynamic, I guess I just want to get a sense if there is anything how the weight per shipment trends might be sort of prevailing tonnage trends going forward. I guess, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been able to sort of going a real strong relationship in the past? Wes Frye : Yes. Over the last couple of decades I think whenever we have seen weight per shipment fall off it\u2019s a precursor to a softer economy and when the weight per shipment gets larger orders are getting bigger and the economy is improving that\u2019s a general correlation, I think has existed as long as I can remember. David Congdon : One thing that we're kind of conscious of that when we had to slowdown in \u201908 and \u2019'09 we actually did not see a drop in our weight per shipment, we saw an increase in our weight per shipment. And what was happening because of the sluggishness of the economy, our shippers were instead of shipping weekly were holding the shipments and shipping every two weeks. So we saw a decrease in the number of shipments and an increase in the weight per shipment. In this environment, we\u2019re seeing the opposite, we\u2019re seeing an increase in the number of shipments, which is a positive sign, but a decrease in the weight per shipment. So what\u2019s going income is more frequent shipments one of the reasons is we\u2019re seeing smaller, but more frequent shipments. Wes Frye : I think back in \u201908, \u201909, it was just such a drastic change in the economy, that calls that phenomenon that they was just said, but now since we\u2019ve been coming out of a recession, we\u2019ve just been on steadily increasing, slowly increasing economy since it was pronounced I guess in July of \u201909, that we came out of the recession, we\u2019ve just never seen any kind of a strong rebound of the economy. But now it\u2019s just kind of gradually [indiscernible] and a gradual shift of the economy. I think you do see the correlation between weight per shipment and the economy, but that drastic period was [this]. David Congdon : Right. And just to make sure there is no question that the weight per shipment dropped this year is definitely related to the greatest degree to the spillover of the truckload last year. The second thing is the macros causing fewer widgets are being demanded so, that's causing it also and then as I mentioned some customers have been shipping more frequently with smaller shipments. But if you look at our weight per shipment, this year it actually compares quite favorably to 2013 and years before. So, it was just said that the last year was an outlier, now what will happen next year -- I mean right now there's a lot of capacity in the truckload market because call it the economy softness now that heats up a little bit is there won't be enough driver availabilities, there're not going to be enough capacity that that can happen again. We don't know, we'll just have to wait and see, but our weight per shipment is really quite comparable to 2013. Unidentified Analyst : The final quick one, just one, I think about CapEx for 2015 you gave a range of how you're thinking about it, any detail you can provide behind it particularly how you think you want to address capacity additions in the current environments, how do you think about that within that 2016 CapEx target? David Congdon : Chris we are anticipating growth for next year. We're bullish on our sales, more certainly in the economy, we think we continue to have opportunities in this marketplace to continue to win market share without some peers service level so within that CapEx range there's definitely some CapEx growth. Operator : Next we'll go to the Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Tom Kim : With regard to your comment on market share gain opportunities are you seeing any rationalization or talks at least amongst your competitors that might be leaning toward that path, we obviously noted, you've been mostly focused on yields over the last couple of years, but I'm curious just given the environment and hear what you're saying about the pricing environment being stable I'm wondering if you're hearing anything that your competitors might be looking to maybe get -- to rationalized existing capacity to keep the pricing environment firm? Thanks. Unidentified Company Representative : I'm not sure I quite understood the question. I'm sorry. Tom Kim : Sure, with regard to your share opportunity, obviously we appreciate that your service levels continue to improve as you reinvest in the business. I'm wondering to what extent your ability to gain share could also be bolstered by possibly competitors maybe rationalizing in this and more softer environment or do we just need to wait and see demand maybe reach phase more before that might happen? David Congdon : Are you saying Tom, that the possibility that some of the LTL competitors will not invest in additional capacity and therefore it has to find a resource and that could be us and our -- is that what you're asking? Tom Kim : Correct. David Congdon : Okay, we don't know. Tom Kim : All right, it's fair enough. Obviously it's still a very fluid market, I mean I think a lot of its just concern it, obviously demand trends have been slowing particularly in the industrial space and we all get that and -- you guys are -- clearly the gold standard for the LTL industry, you've made amazing progress in the OR in your cost structure. To what extent can you comment on the stickiness of that and do you need volumes to increase next year to keep your OR down, keep going down? Thanks. David Congdon : I've addressed this in the past that as we continue -- if we continue to win market share and put density across in that work with a reasonably decent pricing environment which we believe we still are in and we're continuing to improve efficiencies in little ways across the entire company that our operating margins can't continue to improve. So, we still see it that way, if those variables change i.e. the pricing and finally got worse because of -- and usually that's because of a worsening economy and by the way we don\u2019t see worsening economy, we don't get anything back from our sales force that, that our customers are worried about a worsening economy. So, I think we're going to keep seeing a steady economy which should mean these pricing environment -- I think our factors are still good for a continued margin improvement at least as far as we're concerned. Tom Kim : Can I squeeze in this one last one, obviously you've got this strong balance sheet and given that stock has pulled back pretty significantly, would you be inclined if your leverage ratios move up and buyback stock while still sustain your CapEx plans? Wes Frye : Yes, we've been -- we've continue to buy our stock, this year we've bought throughout the third quarter, we've bought up to $85 million and so forth, in the fourth quarter we bought another $20 million, in total we bought out to [indiscernible] on the currency $100 million filling it out. So, we think we can continue to invest heavily in the LTL network which we intent to based on our CapEx guidance for next year but we can execute buybacks as well. Operator : Next we'll go to the side of David Ross with Stifel. Your line is open. David Ross : These questions have not been quite as tough as the moderators from last evening's debate, but if I can just ask on the cost pressures you guys are seeing in the business, heading into 2016, you just put in a weight increase and soon will be another weight increase next year because that's how it goes especially in a driver market, it's difficult, besides that what are you worried about or what are you kind of telling customers about to justify the rate increase, is the equipment cost going up, maintenance cost going up, trailer cost going up etcetera. David Congdon : All of the above, we are generally facing increases in all cost capital, equipment, if real estate continues to rise the price of property continue to rise, for real estate for example we are able to take advantage of some real good real estate deals years ago but as we are looking at real estate today and the size of facilities that we need, there is no deal in real estate now, everything is expensive from the land to the construction cost and even if occasionally we will run across a large service center that suites our need and they are not cheap like they had been in the past. We just generally have cost increase pressure across the board including your wage increases that justify the need for pricing in -- modest price increases each year. Operator : Next we will go to the side of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. John Barnes : Here in terms of all the conversation around maybe about a weaker micro environment kind of playing out and recognizing, you are doing incredible well on the margin performance, can you talk a little bit about when and if you start putting contingency plans in place from a cost reduction perspective, was it -- if actually feel like you need to make constantly available weaker macro or is it just that maybe you slow down the pace of hiring or something like that in the event that you are still taking some market share even in that kind of environment? Thanks. David Congdon : John, we keep an eye on our largest cost there obviously is labor cost to move shipments pickup and delivery and dock and so forward and we were watching that on a daily basis, hourly basis down at the supervisory level actually and historically when you look at any giving year, September's usually your peak and shipments and tonnage per day and then as West pointed on the back on the sequential trends, what you got and what you say in September usually kind of carries out to the end of the year and we built up to handle that peak volume and we are not hiring through for the rest of the year, it is pretty much except for replacements of people that we might lose or just anywhere that we might see that we need to add someone, but we keep our finger on the pulse and if were to see a slowdown we can take action if we need to reduce headcount but we don't see a need for that at this point in time. Operator : Next we will go to the line of Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. Todd Fowler : Alright thanks good morning everyone. I guess just to start, David what percent of your freight you think at this point is retail versus industrial manufacturing and markets? David Congdon : Retails in 10% to 15% range and industrial manufacturing some around the 45%. Todd Fowler : And then what would be the other I guess 40% or so? David Congdon : Well a good measure of that would be the 3PLs and we don\u2019t have a transparency underneath that to see what the mix is. Todd Fowler : Okay that\u2019s help to us. And then just to make sure and understand kind of how you are thinking about the third quarter obviously you gave us the sequential trends but, it's sound like that there was normal seasonality during the third quarter but then the October decline versus September is a little bit greater so, are you seeing more softness now as you move into the fourth quarter versus what you saw in the third quarter? David Congdon : The tonnage comparisons are even tougher year-over-year in the fourth quarter than they were in the third quarter approaching 20% for the fourth quarter last year, so it's a very tough comparison. Todd Fowler : Well I guess what I am referencing was as you gave that October was down I think 4.4% versus September versus a normal decline of 2.8, so I was just trying to get sense of was September stronger and that\u2019s why October is taking a step down or is it just that it's kind of within the range of what you would normally see maybe a little weaker but nothing too concerning? David Congdon : We think that macros definitely have some softness in October, I can put a little color on this October, I was doing a little study this morning, we have a report by our non-operating regions and kind of look at that which regions are stronger than others and it's interesting that our strongest regions happened and be up again easy comparisons last year and our weakest regions for October are up against harder comparisons for last year. And so overall to me it looks like our growth is pretty well balance, that if there is some weakness it will be in what we might call the oil and gas related states and regions of the Pacific Northwest to gulf post region in our central base regions. And that would be, it\u2019s not terribly weak at all for us in those regions. They\u2019re still relatively good, but if there is any weakness that\u2019s where it is. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, that helps and David you just made me feel bad for looking at espn.com this morning to rest of my time. So just one last one Wes, it sounds like that you\u2019re saying that fuel didn\u2019t have a significant impact on the OR in the third quarter. Did I catch that right or you care to quantify maybe the impact of fuel on the OR just as we think sequentially going into the fourth quarter? Thanks. Wes Frye : The impact it was relatively neutral, very little headwind on the reduction fuel surcharge relative to -- I would say if at most it maybe did 10 basis points. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of [indiscernible] with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning guys, nice quarter. Just wanted to ask first. So in terms of the market share gains, I wanted to get a better understanding of the first way that\u2019s coming from and second as you look forward over the next few quarters where you are kind of targeting your efforts for additional market share gains? David Congdon : Our market share gains are really kind of across the board, there is no particular company or region of the country where they are stronger than another. We have a very balanced service product with multiple regional operations, multiple inter-regional connecting regions with adjacent regions and national service. So we\u2019re competing with the small regional players, the multi-regional companies and the national players. And we just get a little bit here and there. So it\u2019s just a matter of working with the customer and [indiscernible] and improving yourself and then building your business and it\u2019s happening all over the company. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. And recently I guess we\u2019re seeing some challenges from some of your peers. I\u2019m wondering any opportunity to gain share? How quickly could you guys ramp up scale if that were necessary and what would that entail? David Congdon : The unique thing that we have going for us is that we have continually invested in our company. We\u2019ve invested in real estate significantly and have continued to build service centers with excess capacity to handle future growth. So if something drastic were to happen in the marketplace with a competitor failing for example. The hardest thing to ramp up is labor and that will be the hardest thing. But we have excess capacity in our real estate and excess capacity in trailers to handle a surge and obviously you can rent tractors and trailers, the hardest thing to ramp up in short order would be drivers and [guard] people. We certainly been anticipate anything drastic in the competitive marketplace happening in the near-term. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just the final question I had was, it seems like the CapEx plans to confirm, Wes mentioned it was 430 to 460 anticipated for 2016 is that right? Wes Frye : Correct. Unidentified Analyst : And it seems like that\u2019s a little bit elevated relative to what it\u2019s been in the past. Is that a new shift for you guys or is there something structurally different that you\u2019re saying that is allowing you to put more money in to work? Wes Frye : It's pretty much on plain for the most part for what our CapEx was this year or will be this year. But in terms of look at as we get larger, as percent of revenue, the CapEx that we\u2019re looking at next year is actually smaller as percent of revenue. And much of that CapEx is still going into expanding network and expanding real estate. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. I guess that's kind of what I\u2019m asking is that, is there kind of a ramp up period that we see and then it comes down as a percent of revenue as you kind of get to a point where you feel comfortable with where your service center network is and maybe kind of the number of tractors you have et cetera? Wes Frye : Yes. We expect to maintain or obviously maintain our fleet on a replacement cycle and then as David mentioned we expect growth and so it's all including that, but on the real estate we will spend what we need to spend to take opportunities but certainly as a percent of revenue going forward we do expect our CapEx as a percent of revenue to stop to drop. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Brad Delco with Stephens. Your line is open. Brad Delco : Hi thanks good morning. I guess Wes I don\u2019t know if this is accurate or not, is this your last earnings call? Wes Frye : It is. Brad Delco : Well, I do want to take the opportunity just to thank you and congratulate you on a long carrier, and then I guess my follow up question for you would be, how much are you guys accrued at this point for your retirement bonus? Wes Frye : It is $3.99. Brad Delco : Per share? Wes Frye : In total. Brad Delco : To get to the real question, I wanted to ask about your exposure to specifically [XBO] and what the acquisition might mean to you from an 3PL perspective. Are you at risk at loosing that business now that they have sort of internal source to move at LTL freight or is that somehow offset with other opportunities that may come about. Just can you give some perspective on that will be great? Wes Frye : Directly we do very little business, in fact [indiscernible] so we don\u2019t see very much risk there. However we do a lot of business with other 3PLs and so we think that we will probably gain market share on that front. Brad Delco : Got you. We kind of heard that yesterday, that potentially some 3PLs may just sort of be challenged to provide some of the information to a carrier now that is effectively owned by a non-asset based logistics provider. So you do think that\u2019s an area of opportunity for further market share gains? Wes Frye : Yes. Brad Delco : Okay, Wes, thank you very much. If you wanted to go out with the fourth quarter of 2016 EPS guidance range I'd welcome that as well. Wes Frye : But then they may take away my $3.99. Brad Delco : Well congratulations and best of luck to you. Wes Frye : Thank you Brad. David Congdon :  And Brad thank you for bringing this up. We're going to miss Wes, he has been with Old Dominion for 30 years and has meant just the world to our company in adding value to what we do internally, with his expertise and financial management, analytical skills and the whole thing. We're going to miss it. Brad Delco : Well, I'm sure. Fortunate for Adam, he's got really big shoes to full or unfortunately I should say. Wes Frye : Hey if you\u2019ve ever seen Adam speak, his feet are bigger than mine so he is very capable of doing that. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Group : Hey thanks, morning guys. So I know there's been a lot of questions on pricing, I don't know if anyone asked about your pricing expectations for next year. Do you think that 3% to 4% range that you're seeing on contractual renewals, is that a good place holder for pricing next year? Wes Frye : We don\u2019t give guidance on that Scott. We think -- as David already mentioned there's no reason why if the macro is halfway decent, we still think that the LTL competitors have got to maintain price in order to improve their [internal] debt to capital and even to provide funds to invest in capital. We'd be surprised but we expect pricing to be stable for most of next year. Scott Group : When you look at the sequential tonnage drop in October, can you see what was the 3PL business any better or worse within that trend? David Congdon : I had to tell the truth, well I haven\u2019t done any detail [indiscernible] where that is Scott. Scott Group : Okay when do you think do you start to see some of that market share come over from Conway? David Congdon : That is hard to say well, well I think it's still uncertain exactly what they will do to Conway and how they will execute on that, so it's hard to say. [Indiscernible] together if they don\u2019t do it properly then it's going to be very difficult, it could cause business to come over. Scott Group : Okay and then just last question. Have you -- is there in your mind a difference in the margins that you get on organic tonnage growth versus market share tonnage growth? David Congdon : By definition there should not be -- I mean we price whether it's organic or whether it's additional, we still price it to earn the margins that we need drop it to investments. Scott Group : So I guess the point of the question I guess is, if in a slower economy if more of the growth just is going to come from market share and less from organic growth. In your mind that doesn't have any implications for the margins or margin [above]? David Congdon : Are you defining organic growth as just general growth in the economy? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. David Congdon : Okay, because, yes it's okay. Alright, it's hard -- it's hard to say. If market share from deeper penetration of existing customers taken away then we do get some leverage because now we're getting multiple pickups that we're going to competitors that are coming on our trucks, so there is some leverage there. David Congdon : Yes, but we could be getting market share and just starting fresh with a brand new customer who is only giving us single shipments to begin with and the margin on that's worse than one where you give additional shipments in existing setup. Wes Frye : It's hard to answer your question Scott. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Tom [indiscernible] with [BVNT]. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Most of my questions have been answered but a couple of things. Let's say the economy stays in this soft patch for a while, does it -- what's your preferred course of action to continue to grow, will it be to expand your sales force and bring in more brand new shippers or to rely maybe disproportionately on the relationships 3PLs can bring you? Wes Frye : Well, we've been in the soft patch since recession ended almost and then -- Unidentified Analyst : It's a fresh soft patch more recently. Wes Frye : We had not added that many sales deep into our ranks for our sales force over the last couple of years, we've been pretty stable with the size and we're just successful winning market share that way even in a soft patch. So, if it got worse would we increase the number of sales people? I don't most really think so. Would we try to increase our focus on 3PL? I don't really think so. We'll discover steady as it goes with our strategies and that seems to be working regardless of the economic cycle we're in. So, I just think we'll stay focused on doing what's working for us now. Unidentified Analyst : And then lastly, maybe just a little clarification, David at the analyst day you've described the economy as somewhat soft, at the same time earlier in the call you said that the feedback you're getting from the sales force is not necessarily indicating a decelerating economy and yet some of the October data suggests maybe it has, I mean how do I package all that together? David Congdon : Keep in mind Tom, that the comparison in October is against the 20 -- almost 21% increase in tonnage last year. Unidentified Analyst : Sure. David Congdon : Yes, it feels a little bit soft, but soft doesn't mean down and that's what the indications are, soft is for 2% to 3%, it's still on the GDP it's still soft and that's how we're defining that. Wes Frye : So unless you're looking at shipments and shipments is sequentially in the fourth quarter is right on target with 10 year sequential trends. And so, we're not seeing a softness on our shipments -- on a number of shipments per day. They're just smaller because of the softness in the economy primarily. Unidentified Analyst : And Wes, did you give the November, December, 10 year average for shipments, I know you gave it for tonnage? Wes Frye : 10 year average for shipments? Unidentified Analyst : Yes, but just for November and December? Wes Frye : I'll provide it, when you average are you talking about the 10 year average sequentially? Unidentified Analyst : Yes, on shipments, not tonnes? Wes Frye : For October the sequential in shipments is down 3.3%, that's what it is, that's what it was in October this year from September. The 10 year average is 3.5%, that you can see was actually better sequentially. Unidentified Analyst : And then do you have November, December, could you give that? Wes Frye : It is expected to be up 1.7 from October and then down 9.6% in the December compared to November. David Congdon : Those are the 10 year averages. Wes Frye : That's the 10 year average. Operator : And next we'll go to the line of Ben Hartford with Baird. Your line is open. Ben Hartford : Quick question on tonnage growth relative to salary and wages and benefit growth, if you look over the past five years' salary wages and benefit growth the growth rate has outpaced tonnage growth rate by about 200 basis points and so I'm interested in whether that relationship should hold or even widen over the next couple of years given the strength that you've talked about with regard to smaller more frequent shipments, any perspective on that as we think about '16 and beyond? Wes Frye : Part of that increase is -- there're a couple of components there, no one as fringe benefits which is [indiscernible] always being inflationary for the most part, and secondly some of that increase in wages -- in special wages as I mentioned is substitution for lower purchase transportation and that's hardly for our LTL vision, we are not hardly using any purchase transportation whatsoever it's all long in Old Dominion's profit company drivers, So some of that's just an offset to that. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, is it fair to think about that relationship holding, you got some offsets, maybe can help us to understand what the offsets would be or is it just for us to think about that 200 basis point spread as being constant even with the strength toward more frequent shipments? Wes Frye : I guess as what I also talked about some of that mathematically is due to the fact that the fuel surcharge is so much lower. So whether it goes in the future I'd hate to say it may depend on what the fuel cost is and how that affects the fuel surcharge. So that has a relationship going forward. So I'm not sure what to expect the relationship will be because of the top line in that and how quickly we continue to substitute purchase transportation with company equipment especially in our drainage division. So I am not sure to what to accept to relate ship would be because of the top line within that and how quickly we continue to substitute purchase transportation, the company own equipments especially on our container grades division. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. D&A took a sizable step up sequentially, this $42.5 million level, was that a clean base and we should build from that as we go through 2016? Wes Frye : Well, we don\u2019t give guidance on that, we'll give you some more details on our CapEx break down, on the January conference call into what is equipment, real estate and then maybe you will have a better basis to make your own calculation of that then. Operator : Next we will go to line of David Campbell with Thompson, Davis & Co. David Campbell : How would you describe your expedited business in the third quarter, was it up as much as the overall LTL tonnage and were the shipments same relationship as your general business? Wes Frye : The expedited revenue was up better than overall revenues for the quarter, yes. David Campbell : Is that better than? Wes Frye : Yes, higher than. David Campbell : Is that anything you would considerate an indicator of future business activity because I would think expedited would be weaker than your general business. Wes Frye : What expect for just growth, whether do you call it from market share or own focus on that which offsets it. And when say expedited, we talked about expedited [indiscernible] domestically not globally. Operator : And we have a follow up from Alex Vecchio with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Alex Vecchio : Thanks for taking the follow up. Hey Wes can I ask you to just repeat the 10 year historical sequential trends in tonnage for November and December? Wes Frye : Yes, in tonnage sequentially we will get to it. Well another way. Okay the sequential trends in tonnage for November the 10 year average is 3% up from October and a reduction of 8.7% in tonnage in December. Alex Vecchio : Got it, okay thanks for that and then I guess just one more. Wes do you have a rough estimate for how much you would need core pricing to increase in order to sustain margin expansion or say it another way if your pricing -- if the market wasn't able to give you pricing so let's say if pricing was X you would be difficult for Old Dominion to expand the margins. Wes Frye : Well our margin improvement is based upon three things, we need to see a macro that's behaving half way that at least a positive, we have to see discipline from pricing in the LTL sector, and of course the last thing both of which are not necessarily within our control there, but third is our leverage that we all have from density growth and I guess there is really a full thing invest that we remain [indiscernible] this for a long pricing because we are providing best in class service and so how much we think we can still and the last few things which is density, on margin improvement and the fact that we still provided best in class service I think still allows us to be able to increase margins through the combination of those two. But if those are affected by macro or by a price addressing us out in the market, which is not in our control then we\u2019ll have to see how that goes? David Congdon : But as far as a specific number, I think he's asking if view went from 3% positive to zero or what will the number be for us not to be able to improve margins. How much\u2026 Wes Frye : And I answer that question. David Congdon : We don\u2019t know that, we\u2019re not to give you that I think it\u2019s very clear. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. David Congdon : We have to really run that calculation to be honest. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. I think the another way after just how much do you need so just offset basic inflation, are you able to kind of roughly estimate that or also a little bit tough? Wes Frye : Well I was say obviously we impose our own inflationary factor in wages by yielding a 3.5% increase and of course that doesn\u2019t apply across the board. And we think we are in fact getting some of that back through improved productivity and we\u2019ll give some of that back through this density. So make-up for that, it has to be a pretty positive number. It wouldn\u2019t be 3.5%, it will be something less than that. David Congdon : Because wages are what 50% Wes Frye : 40%, 50% of our total costs. David Congdon : So you need 2%. Wes Frye : Yes to offset that. Operator : And we have no more questions in queue. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Earl Congdon for closing comments. Earl Congdon : Well guys as always, we thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and your support of Old Dominion. Please feel free to call us if you have any further questions. And thank you again and good day.",

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to the company's Executive Chairman, Mr. Earl Congdon. Please go ahead, sir. Earl Congdon : Good morning, and thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter conference call. Joining me on the line this morning are David Congdon, Old Dominion's Vice Chairman and CEO; and Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. We are pleased to report that Old Dominion produced solid financial results for the fourth quarter of 2015. Despite a soft economic environment and a significant decline in fuel surcharges, we achieved company records for fourth quarter revenue, operating income and earnings per diluted share. In addition, our operating ratio was only 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2014, which was our best fourth quarter ever. We won additional market share during the fourth quarter due to increased demand for our superior on-time, claims-free service that we provide at a fair price. This value proposition continues to be critical to both our financial success and our ability to consistently outperform the growth and profitability of our industry. As we look forward into 2016, we are well-positioned to continue to execute on the fundamental aspects of our business plan and produce further profitable growth. Although the potential for a soft economic environment could present a headwind in 2016, the pricing environment is relatively stable and we expect to win additional market share. To support our company's expected growth, we are continuing to invest in our business with a substantial capital expenditure program in 2016. We also expect to employ excess cash flow to repurchase company stock. Thank you for your time this morning. And now, I'd like to turn the comments portion of our conference over to David Condon. David Congdon : Good morning. We were encouraged by our fourth quarter results, despite the headwinds that were mentioned by Earl. Our team continued to execute our business plan and win market share by providing on-time service of 99% and maintaining a low claim ratio, which was only three-tenth of 1% of revenue for the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter results also reflect our continued commitment to yield management. Revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 6.1%, driven by our pricing discipline as well as the positive impact on this metric from decreased weight per shipment. In addition, we improved our dock and pickup and delivery productivity during the fourth quarter. The combination of these factors and our continued focus on controlling cost contributed to our profitable growth for the quarter. We have long maintained that we could produce long-term profitable growth and margin improvement by focusing on density and yield, assuming a steady macroeconomic environment and rational pricing within our industry. Although the macro has not been as robust as we would like, pricing within our industry has remained relatively stable. We are confident in our ability to continue winning market share and we continue to be very confident about our long-term growth opportunities. Looking forward, we are focused on delivering our proven value proposition, which we expect will continue to fuel three key elements of our business model : fuel management, freight density, and productivity. Old Dominion has outpaced the rest of our industry, and we will continue to strengthen this differentiation through our ongoing significant investments in capacity, technology and employee training and education. These investments have given our employees the tools and knowledge they need to continue to exceed our customers' expectations and help the world keep promises. As a result, we believe we can continue to drive long-term growth and earnings and shareholder value. And thanks for joining us today. And now, Adam will review our financial results for the fourth quarter in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, David, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue was a company record $734.6 million for the fourth quarter, a 1.9% increase from last year. Earnings per diluted share increased to a company fourth-quarter record of $0.85, which was a 4.9% increase from $0.81 earned in the fourth quarter of last year. Our operating ratio was 84.5%, a 10 basis point increase over the fourth quarter of '14. Revenue growth for the fourth quarter reflected a 3% increase in LTL tonnage, which included an 8.2% increase in LTL shipments, offset by a 4.8% decrease in LTL weight per shipment. In addition, LTL revenue per hundredweight decreased 0.2% for the quarter, primarily due to the significant reduction in fuel surcharges. Pricing environment was relatively stable during the quarter, as evidenced by our 6.1% increase in revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges. On a sequential basis, our LTL tonnage per day for the fourth quarter decreased 4.1% as compared to the third quarter of 2015. This was lower than our 10-year average sequential trend, which is a 2.6% decrease. Largest contributor to this variance was December being below its 10-year average. Tonnage trends were also impacted in the fourth quarter by the continued decrease in weight per shipment, which we expect will continue to be a headwind on a comparative year-over-year basis throughout the first half of 2016. LTL shipments per day in the fourth quarter decreased 5% sequentially as compared to the third quarter. This was below our 10-year average sequential decrease of 3.9%, due primarily to December being below its 10-year average. We are pleased with our trends for January, however, which were back above our 10-year average sequential trends. Our LTL tons per day for January 2016 increased 2.2%, as compared to December of 2015. This change compares favorably to the 10-year average sequential increase of 1.9%. On a year-over-year basis, LTL tons per day in January of 2016 increased 2% as compared with January of 2015. Our LTL shipments in January versus December increased 4.8%. This compares favorably to the 10-year average sequential increase of 3.8%. On a year-over-year basis, LTL shipments per day in January of 2016 increased 6.4% as compared to January of 2015. Revenue per day, excluding the fuel surcharges, increased approximately 5% year-over-year for January of 2016, due to both the LTL tonnage increase and the improved LTL revenue per hundredweight, offset by a reduction in revenue for our non-LTL services. Total revenue continues to also be impacted by reduced fuel surcharges, however, as the DoE's price per gallon was approximately 29% less January of 2015. On the operating side, we had a 10 basis point increase in our operating ratio as compared to the fourth quarter. This increase was due primarily to an increase in our fringe benefit cost as a percent of payroll, and increased appreciation associated with our long-term investment in real estate, equipment and information technology. In addition, the significant decline in fuel surcharges had a deleveraging impact on our expense items, although it also primarily accounted for the 310 basis point reduction in operating supplies and expenses. In addition to the increase in benefits, the increase in our salaries, wages and benefits expense also reflects the impact of the 9% increase in full-time employees for the year and 3.5% increase in wages that were effective at the beginning of September. We also increased the use of company-owned equipment and employees to support both our LTL and non-LTL services. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations for 2015 totaled $554 million, a 41.4% increase over 2014. Capital expenditures were $100 million and $462 million for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. In addition, we repurchased $35 million of common stock during the fourth quarter and a total of $114 million for 2015. We completed 2015 with $11.5 million in cash, $134 million in total debt and a ratio of debt to total capitalization of 7.4%. 2016, we have already repurchased an additional $22 million of our shares, which leaves approximately $58 million available for purchase under our previously-authorized $200 million repurchase program, which is scheduled to expire in November of this year. We currently expect to finish this program before the end of the second quarter. We estimate that CapEx for 2016 will total approximately $440 million, including planned expenditures of $180 million for real estate and service center expansion projects, $220 million for tractors and trailers and $40 million for technology and other assets. Effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 35.5% compared with 36.7% for the fourth quarter of 2014. This was lower than originally anticipated, due to additional tax credits approved by Congress in December as well as other favorable discrete tax adjustments. We currently expect an annual effective tax rate of 38.4% for 2016. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for any questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : So I wanted to first ask about incremental margins, call it, 12% in the quarter, so a pretty meaningful step down from what we've seen. Is this the kind of environment where we need to reset our incremental margin expectations lower for now or is there anything kind of unusual on this quarter and we can get back to that 20%-plus range going forward? Adam Satterfield : Scott, we're anticipating incremental margins in the 20% range next year, plus or minus, given the environment. In the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, we did have a higher fringe benefit expense rate. That impacted our OR by about 70 basis points, if you compare the rate of fringes as a percent of payroll and salaries and wages. And so that definitely had an impact on the quarter. If we had used the year-to-date rate, it definitely would have been better. Although, with that said, it was a cost that we incurred in the period and we don't do adjusted numbers. Scott Group : And then, in terms of just the tonnage trends, so I think you said worse than normal in December, but maybe just slightly better than normal in January. What's your take on the underlying demand environment out there? Are you starting to see some signs of stabilization or improvement in industrial activity or, hey, it's just one month and really tough to know? David Congdon : As we all have tracked and watched the ISM, PMI index has been under 50 for about four months. My personal gut feel is that we've been in a slump, we're in a bottom, and I'm more optimistic that we'll see some improvement next year. It is encouraging to see the sequential trend from December into January pick back up again, but December was definitely a headwind for us. It was an unusually soft month on a sequential basis, as Adam pointed out in his comments. But the latest that I read is we are looking at say 2.5% GDP growth for next year. Operator : Moving on, we'll go to Alex Vecchio with Morgan Stanley. Alex Vecchio : Adam, I just wanted to clarify if I got my math right here, if rev per day x fuel was up 5% in January and tonnage is up 2%, that implies that rev per hundredweight x fuel is up about 3%, and that's a pretty big deceleration versus the 6% you had in the fourth quarter. So I just want to make sure I got that math right, and if I did, kind of what's contributing to that deceleration in the yields x fuel? Adam Satterfield : The revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel, was up about 4.5% in January. If you think about the step down, if you are comparing to November and December, we are now lapping the GRI that went into effect in January of 2015. Alex Vecchio : Are you seeing any -- and you guys noted that pricing remains relatively stable. I assume you're not seeing any kind of irrational behavior out there from any competitors. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on that to the extent, because obviously we heard from RFB that they took a little bit of pricing actions on some part of their book of business? So maybe you can comment a little bit about what you're seeing out there from a competitive pricing standpoint? David Congdon : The comment I read on, what RFB said, was that they -- it sounded to me like they took it on their spot quote type business that they were being more aggressive on that type business. Maybe I misunderstood it. But nonetheless, we still believe the environment continues to be relatively stable. I mean, overtime, you've always had spotty rationalization here and there that occurs. But our pricing policies and practices remain unchanged. We feel confident and good about the pricing environment right now. Alex Vecchio : And then just lastly, are you still getting the 3.5% to 4% core rate increases on contracts, kind of consistent with what you saw in the third quarter? Adam Satterfield : We're anticipating 3% to 4% increases, as we move through 2016. Operator : And moving on, we'll go to Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Chris Wetherbee : I wanted to touch a little bit on some of the resources side of the business. So in the environment, where we have a little bit of a slower tonnage dynamic, how do we think about sort of some of the resources like headcount and infrastructure of the business? I guess, maybe starting with headcount, how should we think about that for 2016? David Congdon : We've built up our headcount last fall due to the volumes of the business we had. And we've held the line on any growth in headcount through the holiday, and we've had some attrition. But we will gear our headcount to the volumes that we see, as they're building in the first quarter. But what is it year-over-year right now, Adam? Adam Satterfield : The headcount was up 9%. Keep in mind, we're still anticipating growth this year. In January, our shipments per day are trending up over 6%. So we're still positive on our long-term opportunities. We're anticipating growth and we're continuing to invest in our people and making investments in capacity as well, that we think are necessary for our long-term success. Chris Wetherbee : And you mentioned sort of a 2.5% GDP type of environment is what you're sort of looking at, when you think about the potential for continued market share gains. Any way we can kind of tie that back to how you might think sort of volumes could play out? Do we get a little bit better from here, the 2% range or how do you think about that just sort of directionally, would be helpful? Adam Satterfield : We think that we've got market share opportunities and we've long outperformed when you just look at GDP or industrial production-type numbers, and it gets back to the quality of service that we provide at a fair price, and we still think that's a winning formula and that's what we continue to execute on. So with that, and assuming a rational pricing within the industry, we think that's a winning formula for us and what we're going to stick to. Operator : Moving on, we'll go to Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison Landry : In terms of the CapEx guidance down modestly year-over-year in 2016, but if we do see macro conditions deteriorate further, how much and where do you think you could scale back spending this year? David Congdon : The real estate is fairly well fixed, because it relates to projects that are pretty much underway and things that we need to do for the future as well as the IT and other spend. We have some flexibility in the equipment side of the equation. We buy a certain amount of that as for our replacement cycle that we would not change. But the equipment that's in there for growth could be adjusted. We have cancellation provisions at roughly 90 days. Allison Landry : And then just my follow-up question. Thinking about your comments on weight per shipment and expecting it to still be a headwind in the first half of the year. How should we think about it for the back half, would you expect it to be sort of flattish year-over-year? Adam Satterfield : Where we're trending right now is pretty consistent. It seems like it stabilized in the fourth quarter compared to where we were in the third quarter of '15. And it seems like this weight per shipment now is trending somewhere around that 15.40 to 15.50 range. And so once you get back into the back half of 2015 on a comparative basis, then it will be a little more normalized. David Congdon : Allison, while you're on that subject, I want to just throw some color on weight per shipment and a little bit more about the headwind that it has been for us and perhaps even affecting the industry, because we haven't really talked about it much. But when you think about it, a lower weight per shipment means a lower revenue per shipment against a cost per shipment that is a bit harder to reduce. And furthermore, fuel surcharges are calculated as a percentage of revenue, so you actually lose a little bit on fuel surcharge per shipment too, because of a lower weight. It's really similar to the oil industry at the drilling level. This very low revenue per barrel is against a cost per barrel to extract that has not really dropped. I mean it's a similar correlation. We handle shipments across the dock and shipments in P&D. If you think about putting your forklift under a 1,000 pound skid and carrying it across the dock versus say a skid that only weighs 800 pounds, because the shipper shipped a smaller shipment, our time to handle that shipment does not change at all, to speak of. So we have seen pressure in our pounds per hour in both dock and pick up and delivery. On the other hand, our shipments per hour, this is where we're seeing the improvements in productivity. We're handling the shipments more efficiently. But again, your cost of going across that dock with a lower-revenue shipment is about the same. And we've also seen some pressure in our line haul load averages. We load trailers -- most of our freight is skidded these days, so you put a skid on the floor, you bring a rack down from the ceiling, you put a skid on top of a rack. And if these skids weigh a 100 pounds less or 200 pounds less, you've got a little bit more air in between those skids, and we've seen pressure or a downward pressure or headwind in line haul load averages. But the good news is that we have overcome this pressure this year and we delivered a 100 basis point reduction in our operating ratio for the entire year of 2015. As Adam pointed out, sequentially we think we've bottomed out on the weight per shipment. And as we lap the lower weight per shipment later in the year, it won't appear as big of an issue for us, but I thought it would add that color. Does that help? Operator : And next, we'll go to Brad Delco with Stephens. Brad Delco : Can you maybe rationalize for us what you think played out in December? And Adam I don't know if you gave us what December tonnage was on a year-over-year basis, can you provide that as well? And then maybe, what you think sort of played out in January and why you've seen these trends? Adam Satterfield : On a year-over-year basis, December was up. The tonnage per day was only up 1.1% and it felt a little softer. And I think when you look through some of the ISM numbers and things like that, that's definitely a tough economy and so forth. But again it gets back to, we think that we've got a good opportunity for this coming year. We see new account wins every day that are presented by our sales team. We're getting additional business from many of our 3PL customers every day, and a lot of it comes back to the quality of service that we're providing. Now, there are many times where we might lose an account on price. And then not long after, we'll get reports about that whoever the competitor X was, was just not providing the level of service, whether it be the on-time service from a pickup standpoint, meeting appointment delivery times or just the damages issue, in many cases we'll get that back. So I think that we're going to continue to execute on what we've done and we think we've got good trends ahead, if we can continue to deliver this premium level of service at a fair price. Brad Delco : And maybe just a follow-up there. Adam, I guess there has been this debate as to how LTLs will play a role in sort of this e-commerce trend. Can you talk a little bit about how you think you're prepared or set up for that? David Congdon : In the e-commerce trend, there continues to be a demand for LTL service moving freight into the distribution centers, where the e-commerce freight goes back out by parcel. And with the just-in-time type inventory trends that we've seen and everyone wants everything faster and quicker, I think the premium service LTL providers can continue to bring freight into these distribution centers to fill the e-commerce demand. Operator : And next, we'll go to Matt Brooklier with Longbow Research. Matt Brooklier : I think you talked to it earlier in the call, but your purchase transportation costs dropped. It was a little bit more than we had thought, which is good to see. But I'm trying to figure out how much of that was just a function of fuel, as fuel also passes through that line? And how much of that was a function of you guys doing things a little bit different in a network and maybe taking more of your moves in house? So then trying to think about that, if that was a benefit in 4Q, thinking about that as we move into 2016? David Congdon : Well, there are two major factors on that. Last fall, before the fourth quarter even ended, we had shifted from a rail operation to an over-the-road operation from Chicago up to the Pacific Northwest. And so we reduced a lot of purchase transportation that we had in that lane, and put it on company trucks. And the second piece has been a shift in strategy with our ocean container division to move toward a company truck model, and so we don't have that purchased transportation line haul. And I guess, there is a third one, we had the purchased transportation that had to do with our ocean forwarding operations that we have chosen to take a different path on that. Adam Satterfield : On a lot of that decrease though, as David mentioned, has shifted into salaries, wages and benefits, where we're using our own employees, particularly on the drayage side. David Congdon : And operating supplies and expenses. Adam Satterfield : That's right. Matt Brooklier : But I guess, the question is the net benefit is potentially advantageous, as you're not going out into the market, and you're using your own equipment to move, I guess, more of this ocean stuff that you do? David Congdon : Correct. It all has to do with improving, maintaining and improving our best-in-class position as a best-in-class LTL service provider. Matt Brooklier : And then you talked to the amount of stock you've repurchased in first quarter, and there are some remaining. Just to clarify, you expect to be through the current repurchase authorization by the end of this year or by the end of 2Q? Adam Satterfield : The end of the second quarter of this year, it would be about six months early on the program. Matt Brooklier : And then when does the Board meet again to discuss potential uses of capital moving forward? Adam Satterfield : We'll continue to evaluate those and discuss with our Board at the appropriate time, but we feel like shareholder returns have been a good way, and will continue to be a good way to improve total shareholder returns. But that is in third place in our capital allocation strategy. We're going to continue to invest in the business, number one, which you continue to see. We've got a healthy CapEx program. We'll continue to look at any type of acquisition opportunities that may present themselves, and then some type of shareholder return to again support shares and stockholders. Operator : And next we'll go to David Ross with Stifel. David Ross : Adam, you talked about the fringe benefit expense coming in, in the quarter, because I noticed the salary, wage and benefits line was at the highest level, at least as a percentage of revenue, in about six years. Can you just talk a little bit more about that? I think that was $5 million in the quarter. And then, anything else that's going on there besides just the wage increase and headcount increase, with the absence of revenue increase? Adam Satterfield : Yes. Obviously, that was a big driver, the 3.5% wage increase and just the general increase in number of employees. And then part of that was again this flip of where we're doing some of this business with our own employees and equipment, now particularly on the drayage side. With the fringes, we just had some unfavorable experience within group health and with our workers comp in the fourth quarter. And so as a percent of salary and wages, the fringe rate was at 33.8%. It's been trending more in the 32% to 32.5% earlier in the year. So that's not something that we necessarily see, and think will be a trend going forward. It's something obviously that we pay close attention to, but it was somewhat out of line with what we had seen earlier in the year. David Ross : And you talked about seeing lower revenue to start the year from your non-LTL services. Can you, I guess, comment little bit about the non-LTL services and how you see them growing organically or via acquisition over the next year or two? Adam Satterfield : I think that again, as David just talked about, on the drayage side, we closed a few locations where business levels just were not up to our expectations. We're continuing to focus on the existing locations that we're serving. We're trying to improve the level of service that we're giving in that market, and trying to differentiate ourselves against others that are serving. And so we're going to continue to look at that. We think that our value-added services are good for our business. They add value to our customer base, and we think we can do well with them, so we'll continue to support them. And on a same-store basis, we're continuing to see growth, but we'll have a little headwind there. And then the international freight forwarding, we're just not doing that business direct anymore, and starting in the fourth quarter of last year. But we think overall, we're going to continue to support the services that remain, and look to continue to enhance those. Operator : And next from Deutsche Bank, we'll go to Rob Salmon. Rob Salmon : I guess, David, going back to the question related to e-commerce, if I'm thinking about the composition of those shipments, are those at all different from what you see with your traditional retail shipments, in terms of the size and weight profile? David Congdon : We don't really segment that out to give you a definite answer, but the gut feel is the answer is no. They're roughly the same. Rob Salmon : I guess if I go back to the discussion, I think in the prepared remarks, you talked little bit to productivity. Could you walk us through some of the year-over-year changes in pounds per hour, line haul load average, et cetera? Adam Satterfield : From a pounds per hour standpoint, it's continued to be pressured, just by the decrease in the weight per shipment. On the dock, our shipments per hour were actually up 5% in the fourth quarter on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The pounds per hour though was actually up 0.6%. Looking in P&D, our P&D shipments per hour were up about 0.5%. Our load average in line haul was down about 2.5%, and again, that gets into the detail that David was speaking of, with the weight per shipment being down, and how that can impact your line haul operations. Rob Salmon : Got it. And then, basically with the expectation for weight per shipment to flatten out in the back half of year, it will remain a headwind first half and then we should see underlying improved productivity in the back half, assuming the shipment growth continues? David Congdon : Yes, there's one other factor about productivity is if you turn the clock back a year ago, we had some fairly strong growth in the latter half of 2014, and we were adding a lot of people. And for a dock worker to get into our company and get up to speed, and learn our systems, and learn the way that we load freight to minimize damage and maximize load average, et cetera, et cetera, it takes at least six months to nine months for somebody to get up to speed. And so now that we're kind of in a, I would say, I'll call it a soft spot in the economy, a good thing about that is that we're not having to add more new people right now, and the people that we have are reaching that, they're getting in a stride now, of where their productivity is improving. So if there is a benefit of a slower growth economy that might be one of them. Operator : Next, we'll go to Ari Rosa with Bank of America. Ari Rosa : I just wanted to ask first about the competitive landscape. Obviously, there been some competitive changes over the last few months. I wanted to see what you're hearing in terms of customer turnover? Do you think that there have been, created some additional opportunities to build share more aggressively, particularly in the slow growth environment or have you guys not really noticed anything along that front? David Congdon : Frankly, we've seen some opportunities with some of the competitive changes in the marketplace. We do business with -- about a third of our business, roughly maybe 30% with 3PLs, and one of the really -- we're in a really unique position as an asset-based LTL service provider, with no conflicts of interest at all with our 3PL customers, and that does offer us an opportunity to serve that segment of the market, and serve it well, and build levels of trust with 3PLs to grow our business with those 3PLs. So we've had a few opportunities in that arena. Ari Rosa : And then just my second question. Looking to 2016, and obviously you are dealing with slightly slower volume growth here. Does that change at all your ability to focus on service or does that change kind of what your productivity initiatives are for 2016? How are you guys thinking about operations in the year ahead given kind of the slower volume growth? David Congdon : It's just embedded in the culture of this business and the way that we run our business is continuous improvement. So I don't see us changing our focus on continuously looking for better ways of doing things and improving efficiencies, there's really no change there. Does that answer the question? Ari Rosa : I don't know if you could be more specific in terms of what you're looking at? Obviously the margins -- seeing the margins not maybe moving at the same rate, can you continue to drive margins in the slower growth environment, I guess that's what I'm asking? David Congdon : It's a little harder. And a lot of that will depend on, to some degree, the competitive landscape out there, and what the competitors do with pricing. I want to point something out, and turn the clock back on something that we have pointed out going back into '06, '07, '08, '09. We had done an analysis, and we said that for every 1 percentage point price reduction, it required 4% to 5% increase in volume to offset that price reduction, from an EPS standpoint, that's earnings per share or earnings after-tax. So with that said, you're doing more volume at a lower price, so therefore your margin suffers. It might take twice that much more volume to keep the margin where your margins are, and that's just for a mere 1% reduction. I remember distinctly some competitors back in the days chopping prices 15% to as much as 30%. If you go back and look the history, remember what happened to the operating ratios of some of the players in our industry, and look at where they are today, and frankly they haven't got it back. It requires a tremendous investment in this business, and strong margins to afford to play, and to afford to provide the best service. And I just hope that we don't get into some kind of bad pricing environment, but as we have stated here today, we still believe the market is relatively stable and things are good in the pricing environment. Ari Rosa : And so, so far you haven't seen competitors really trying to undercut you in price, so far, it sounds like? David Congdon : No, that happen has always happened from time to time, from place to place, especially so where a competitor is not doing business with a particular account, and they don't understand the cost of that account, they don't understand what the freight is all about, and they just go in and put in a price to try to get the business, and than they later discover, whoops, the price was too low, and now we need to raise the price up, and that's when the customers turn around and come back to us for our strong service product. Operator : And next from BB&T, we'll go to Thom Albrecht. Thom Albrecht : I was wondering a couple of different things. When you try to manage labor, I was wondering if part of the challenge in the fourth quarter was the natural inclination is to expect the last four or five weeks before Christmas to be a bit busier. I'm sure some of your customers probably insinuated that, so you're probably staffed a little bit higher in anticipation of that. Was that also a factor, besides what you've already described? David Congdon : We pretty much reached peak staffing by the end of September. And historically, you see a little fall-off in October per day, and it comes back up a little bit in November, and then it falls off a certain amount in December. And we held the line on hiring any more people during this fall season, and actually had a little bit of attrition going in all the way into December, maybe from the level we were at in September. Not much, but we manage our labor day-in and day-out and by the hour. And our productivity in the fourth quarter, in terms of shipments per hour, we're still very strong. So I don't think we were squeezed too bad on the labor, because we had too many people. Thom Albrecht : And then when you talk about spot quotes and transactional business, and that, and I know overwhelmingly that's not what you do, but I'm just curious what percentage of your business, when it gets softer, kind of is oriented towards that end of the market versus maybe a year or so ago, when it was really tight? Adam Satterfield : Probably less than 5%. We try to be more strategic and have it on a relationship basis and the business that we do with our third-party logistics partners is more strategic in nature, and we try to avoid the transactional type of business, so we're forming long-term relationships with people that we can continue to drive growth with. Thom Albrecht : And then my last question would be, it seems like in September, October, maybe early November, there had started to be some pretty aggressive pricing within the 3PL community, but it maybe feels like that has steadied out a little bit. What's your read of maybe back then versus right now, and whether it has steadied out? David Congdon : Honestly, I'm not sure we saw that trend that you're referring to. Our relationships with 3PLs are on a individual, account by account basis, within 3PLs the stable of customers. And we price each account accordingly, and we just didn't see and I don't think we've seen any trend anywhere, resembling what you just referred to. Operator : Moving on, we'll go to David Campbell with Thompson, Davis & Co. David Campbell : David Congdon, I think you talked a lot about the weight per shipment and the trends there. But I didn't hear, maybe I missed it, but did you say anything about differences between industries or mix of business? Is the mix of business contributing to the decrease in weight per shipment or is it just that every shipment, every customer is doing less? David Congdon : It's a good question and the feedback we get, and from the data that we have, we think it's a general trend across all the customers. But another point that, I'm not sure we as a company or industry even have talked much about, is this whole energy industry. That is probably affecting our economy all across the board with what's going on with the price of oil. You think that the price of oil being down would stimulate more consumer demand than it has. And there are some economists who believe that the consumer is going to pull us out of this slump next year and perhaps that will be the case. But the industrial economy that supports the energy industry has a lot of tentacles, and we haul, what's our percentage of industrial? Adam Satterfield : About 40%. David Congdon : About 40% of our freight is industrial, and embedded in that piece are industrial customers that are tied with the energy industry. So that's probably where we're seeing some of the business softness. David Campbell : But it's not just industrial that you're down weight per shipment, you're down in other types of business as well? David Congdon : Correct David Campbell : And my second question would be, were the trends in the fourth quarter in tonnage. I don't think I heard, I heard December was up 2%, but I didn't hear October November. Do you have those numbers? Adam Satterfield : The year-over-year trends in weight per day were, it was plus 4.4% in October, plus 3.1% in November, and plus 1.1% in December. And those are all year-over-year. Operator : And we'll go to Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Fowler : Adam, I just wanted to clarify, I mean the comment on the expectations for 20% incremental margins, I think in the past has been 15% to 20%, and maybe even speaking more recently to 20%, and I just haven't picked up on it, but are 20% incrementals what we should be thinking about? And if so, is there structurally something different that gives you more confidence with that number versus the 15% to 20% prior? Adam Satterfield : No. That's just what we're thinking about that we think we can achieve this year, and obviously that can go up or down depending on all the variables that go into it. But I think we're just trying to be a little bit more targeted, with what we think, and we've achieved rates greater than 20% in the past. And we feel good about what our opportunities are for this coming year. Todd Fowler : And the maybe just one last follow-up, David, I know there has been a lot of comments or a lot of questions on the weight per shipment, and you have obviously provided some very helpful color, but is your view primarily that the decline in weight per shipment is something that's been cyclical versus something that's secular? And once we move through, to your point, the softer patch, we will see that weight per shipment start to trend up and then we start to get back some of the margin benefits of the higher weight per shipment versus what you're seeing in the network right now? David Congdon : So historically, when LTL weight per shipment goes down, it has been tied to an economic -- the economy is slowing down. When the economy picks back up, the weight per shipment, the orders that people order get larger. So I do believe part of the weight per shipment decline is due to the soft patch we're in, in the economy. So therefore, if we get some economic improvement, you would think the weight per shipment would come back up and those headwinds that I have mentioned would turn around and be a positive benefit for us. Todd Fowler : All of that makes sense. And congratulations on the results for the year, I know it was a challenging year kind of from where we started at this point last year. Operator : And next from Baird, we'll go to Ben Hartford. Ben Hartford : Adam, quick follow-up, just a small item here, the number of working days per quarter in 2016 and 2017, could you provide those? Adam Satterfield : 2016 is 64 the first quarter, which is one extra day compared to 63 in the first quarter of '15. For the second quarter, 64 in the third quarter, 62 in the fourth quarter. And that compares to 63 in the fourth quarter of '15. I don't have 17 in front of me by quarter. Operator : And next we'll go to Darren Hicks with Evercore ISI. Darren Hicks : Just was curious, in what ways do you believe that your market share gains could benefit any kind of pricing advantage? Is that going to give you more intelligence? I'm not sure if you can kind of muscle your way into better pricing, but just curious if you expect that your market share gains to help pricing, in addition to obviously volume? David Congdon : I'm not sure we've ever seen a correlation between market share gains and what kind of a pricing we can get. We're winning market share by winning new customers on board, and by winning additional lanes, and states, and shipping locations, and so forth, from existing customers. And the pricing or program that we have is individual to each customer. And kind of when you look at revenue per hundredweight, it's all the result of looking at the whole operating ratio of an account. And it's hard to say, you could gain new short-haul lanes from a customer, and the revenue per hundredweight be less than your average, and you can drag down your revenue per hundredweight. And it looks bad from a pricing standpoint, the way that the industry, the way you all look at pricing, and hell, we might be operating the count at a 75 or 80, on that lower revenue per hundredweight. So it's all about pricing to the operating ratio of each individual account. And the revenue per hundredweight is merely a result of that type of approach to pricing. Adam Satterfield : I'm not sure if I understood your question correctly, but we don't try to go into a new account by means of pricing, whereas we try to put a lowball offer in, and then anticipate we can get our pricing up later So we try to treat any new account just like an existing account, and go through our costing process to ensure that each account is contributing to the overall operating ratio. David Congdon : And we arrive at a fair and equitable price for us and for the customer. Darren Hicks : I guess I was just thinking that maybe as you think take on more volume, that you could have better intelligence on what the best pricing is for any particular account, but you answered it quite clearly. The other question has to do with your employee count. It seems like the market is pretty healthy, I mean you're expected to grow your employee number 9% or that's what you did in the fourth quarter, with the wages up 3.5%. I'm just trying to look forward, the economy is kind of flat, or in a flat year, what would you expect kind of the wages to be, you don't have to give a particular number, but is there a certain baked-in inflation that you expect for your employees or is that mostly contingent upon productivity results that are within the company? Adam Satterfield : We just gave the 3.5% wage increase September 1. So obviously that will be in inflationary factor, as we go through next year. But we've long maintained that a key to our success has been taking care of our employees. Our employees are what drives the results of the company, that's given this best-in-class service 99% on time, cargo claims at 0.3%. So that is something that is near and dear to our hearts, and we believe strongly in. So we will always look at, and historically have said, so goes the success of the company, so goes our employees' success as well. So that's something we look at and evaluate every year. Typically it's something that goes into effect on September 1. Operator : And gentlemen, there are no further questions. I'll turn it back to you for any additional or closing comments. End of Q&A Earl Congdon : Well, guys, as always, thank you very much for your participation today. We continue to appreciate your questions and your support of Old Dominion. So please feel free to give us a call if you have any further questions. Thank you, and good day. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. We would like to thank everyone for their participation.",

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to the company's Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Chairman, Mr. David Congdon. Please go ahead, sir. David Congdon : Good morning and thanks for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. With me this morning is Adam Satterfield, our CFO, and after some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. First quarter of 2016 was a period of mixed results for Old Dominion. From a headline standpoint, slower topline growth and increased operating expenses resulted in an increase of 80 basis points in our operating ratio and a $0.01 decline in our earnings per diluted share. It was still a good quarter though given the challenging environment and a comparison against our record first quarter results in 2015. After a tough quarter, after a tough fourth quarter of 2015, we were encouraged by the sequential growth in tons per day of 2.2% in January as compared with December, which was slightly above the 10 year average. February and March were not as strong as we would've liked, and as a result our tons per day for the quarter decreased 3.3% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Note that the tons per day for the first quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by Good Friday occurring in March this year as compared to April in 2015. As you know, our long-term record of margin expansion has been built on increasing freight density and yield which generally requires a positive macroeconomic and pricing environment. 1.2% year over year increase in our tons per day reflects the sluggish macro environment and does not help much with frank density given the significant investments we have made in capacity. While we didn't gain a significant amount of density in the quarter, we were able to improve our platform productivity with a nearly 6% increase in platform shipments per hour and a 2.7% increase in platform pounds per hour. Pickup and delivery productivity metrics were also consistent with the first quarter of last year. Our line haul load average decreased 3.5% as our line haul productivity continue to be negatively impacted by a lower weight per shipment. The other key component to long-term margin improvement is yield. We maintained our price discipline during the quarter, and our expectation of achieving 3% to 4% price increases this year has not changed. Revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased 3.8% as compared to the first quarter of 2015. Continued growth in revenue per hundred weights is indicative of a relatively stable pricing environment, although we have recently noted an increase in price competition. This has been primarily at select locations and customer accounts which you might expect in the slower economy and has not been broad-based. Nevertheless, we believe our growth in tons and shipments per day demonstrates that we continue to win market share for the quarter. This ability to win market share continues to be based on our ability to deliver total value to our customers by providing superior service at a fair price. We continue to deliver 99% on time and our cargo claim ratio was 0.37% of revenue. We look forward our plan in the pace of either ongoing macro weakness or a stronger environment is absolutely clear and has not changed. We will continue to provide our clients superior on time claims free service at a fair price. We will maintain our pricing discipline. And we will continue to invest in capacity, technology and training and education for our team. These factors all contribute to a value proposition that allows us to keep the promises we make to our customers and their customers every day. Focused execution of this fundamental approach to our business has helped us create one of the strongest records of growth and profitability in the LTL industry across the long and the short term and through the full economic cycle. As a result, we are confident in our ability to continue winning market share and in our long-term prospects for further profitable growth and increased shareholder value. Again, thanks for joining us today, and now Adam will review our financial results for the first quarter in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, David and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue was $707.7 million for the first quarter of 2016, a 1.6% increase from last year. Earnings per diluted share were $0.72 which was a 1.4% decrease from the $0.73 earned in the first quarter of last year. Our operating ratio was 85.9% which was an 80 basis point increase over the first quarter of 2015. Revenue growth for the first quarter which included one extra workday included a 2.8% increase in LTL tons that consisted of a 6.2% increase in LTL shipments offset by a 3.3% decrease in LTL weight per shipment. In addition, our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 0.3% for the quarter, but this metric continue to be impacted by the significant decline in fuel surcharges. Revenue per hundredweight excluding the fuel surcharges increased 3.8%. David mentioned we view the pricing environment as relatively stable and have not seen broad-based irrational pricing. We continue to believe that maintaining a disciplined approach to pricing is the path to improved profitability for any LTL carrier and given the low margin profile of our industry, pricing should remain firm overall. On a sequential basis LTL tonnage per day for the first quarter decreased 3.3% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. This was lower than our 10 year average sequential trend which is a 0.2% decrease. Started the quarter with a sequential increase in tons per day for January of 2.2% which was slightly above the 10 year average change of 2%. February and March, however, were both below our long term trends for those periods. We're somewhat cautious with our outlook for the second quarter based on April's trends. We were expecting April's LTL tons per day to be back above the 10 year average sequential trend of plus 0.3% which is typical when Good Friday occurs in March. LTL tons per day for April 2016 as compared to March are currently flattish, however, which is indicative of the challenging environment. On a year-over-year basis our month-to-date LTL tons per day in April have decreased 0.3% as compared with the same period in April of 2015. The year-over-year revenue for the second quarter will also continue to be negatively impacted by the declines in fuel surcharges and non-LTL revenue. We will provide an update for actual April trends when we file our 10-Q. Our operating ratio for the first quarter of 2016 increased 80 basis points as compared to the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily a result of an increase in salaries, wages and benefits due to a 6.7% increase in the average number of full-time employees and higher benefit costs. Our fringe benefit costs were 34.6% of salaries and wages as compared to 33.1% of salaries and wages in the first quarter 2015 due to increased costs for our group health and paid time off benefits, as well as retirement plan cost that are related to the performance of our common stock. We also had an increase in depreciation associated with the long-term investments we've made in real estate equipment and information technology. A significant decline in fuel surcharges had a deleveraging impact on our expenses and also accounted for the 200 basis point reduction in operating supplies and expenses that helped offset the previously mentioned items. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations for the first quarter 2016 totaled $168.4 million, a 2.4% decrease from the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were 120.3 million and we repurchased $44.6 million of our common stock during the quarter. Completed the quarter was $7.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, $125.3 million of total debt, and a ratio of debt to total capitalization of 6.9%. The end of the first quarter we have repurchased an additional $30 million of our common stock which leaves approximately $23 million available for purchase under our previously authorized $200 million repurchase program. We expect to purchase this remaining amount during the second quarter and we'll seek authorization for a new share repurchase program. Estimate the CapEx for 2016 will total approximately $405 million which is a $35 million reduction from the estimate we provided in February. We reduced this estimate based on current volume trends. Revise total includes planned expenditures of $170 million for real estate and service and expansion projects, $200 million for tractors and trailers, and $35 million for technology and other assets. Effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2016 was 38.4% compared with 38.6% for the first quarter of 2015. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be 38.4% for the remainder of 2016. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take the first question today from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Allison Landry : Good morning thanks. So, thinking about the weaker tonnage trends and margin into April, do you think that that is reflecting sort of a normal lag in ISM index? And if you think that's the case, does it feel like maybe we're nearing a bottom here in terms of LTL tonnage consistent with the recent recovery we've seen in the index? David Congdon : Allison that's kind of hard to say. It was encouraging to see the ISM bump back up and historically there has been a lag. So, hopefully, it means things [indiscernible] a little bit. But we're clearly in a soft economy. We saw it pretty much throughout 2015 and especially settled in the third and fourth quarters and the first quarter of this year and going into April. But when we survey our field and our sales force out in the field, the customer feedback across the board is that it's just generally soft. It's a little bit hard to know what the ripple effect is of the energy sector across the whole nation as well. We've seen it little bit more hard hit in our Gulf Coast regions, in Central States regions where we do some energy-related business, but it's just generally soft. So we're obviously as hopeful as everyone else that things will turn around and get better. But if they don't, we are prepared for it. Allison Landry : Okay. And then thinking about, Adam, in terms of the cost increases you saw on the labor line in the first quarter. How do we think about those trends on a go forward basis? Adam Satterfield : Well, obviously, we don't give guidance in terms of margin, but we continue to do our best with managing our labor trends. Some of the head count increase that you're seeing or that we talked about of 6.7% increase includes where we've changed our [indiscernible] model to an employee-based model versus our use of owner-operators in the past. And so you saw somewhat of a shift from purchase transportation into salaries and wages. So I think that we've done a good job. When you look at fulltime - the number of fulltime employees that we had at the end of the year, that decreased from December to March. So we're doing those things. And we're just generally keeping our belt as tight as we can, when it comes to any discretionary spending across the board, while our revenue levels have been a little softer. But I think that you saw, when you look at our depreciation and the increase that we had from first quarter 2015 to 2016, that's just indicative of the long-term investments that we've made in the business and in systems that we think will give us long-term strategic advantages going forward from an operating efficiency standpoint and generally having the capacity to grow. So in the short run, depreciation can be more of a headwind from a margin standpoint when our revenues have just been a little bit softer than we would have liked. Allison Landry : Okay. Got it. And just to clarify, in terms of the fringe benefits that were increased percentage of the total labor line in the first quarter, should we think about sort of the increased cost for the group health etcetera as being elevated for the balance of the year? Adam Satterfield : That's a hard one to say. We first saw the increase in our group health cost in the fourth quarter, and it sort of was that line with trends that we had seen really for the first three quarters of last year and 2014 trends as well. So we've spent a lot of time going through that and what's driving the increase right now is just the number of claimants that are filing claims. Our average severity trends at least in the first quarter have been pretty consistent. But generally when we've seen increases like this, when you go back into 2013, we kind of had a period of several quarters with increasing trends. That has continued, and frankly in April our group health the payments that we make out every day have continued to be at the sort of similar elevated level. And so, we are doing everything we can in terms of looking at reasons why. We're having claims filed and if there are any type of preventative programs generally the way we think of it is this is the health and welfare of our employees and their dependents. And so we want to make sure that we're doing all the things we can to make sure that our people are healthy. Allison Landry : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please go ahead. Chris Wetherbee : Thanks, good morning. I wanted to touch on the pricing environment. So certainly you held up well but you did mentioned that you're seeing some issues on the margin. I guess maybe two questions, first, in terms of sort of the natural trend if we see volume stay weak, when would you expect maybe some of these isolated pricing issues to maybe get a little bit wider? And then do you think that there are specific players who may be doing things in order to sustain tonnage or maybe turnaround businesses that could be impacting you think it's specific players or just more sort of economically driven? David Congdon : I'll try - I'll take that one Chris. First of all, our yield is still in line with our expectations for the year, 3.8. And the industry behavior seems relatively good and when I say relatively, I'm saying relative to what happened in 2008 and 2009. One of the things that I think is a real positive for our industry is the amount of focus that so many of our competitors are putting on technology and dimensioners in particular. That's something that we implemented over a decade ago, and those are dimensioners are really important for accurate costing, they are really important tool. And it's good to see the industry looking at that. We see our GRI Holding as we would've expected it to and our ability to get contract increases still in the 3% to 4% range which is what we expected. So we think the markets really hold the line pretty well on its yield management. So we have seen some spotty in any market you will see spotty irrational pricing behavior and a lot of and I think it's just because the competitor doesn't understand handling characteristics of the freight, might put in a price that's just crazy in our view. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That's helpful color. And then when you just think about sort of the resources of your business relative to maybe what the tonnage outlook might be, if we stay sort of in the sluggish pattern we've been in at least for the last two months, how do you think about what you might need to do with resources or that sort of the leverage you can pull to kind of the manage the cost side of the equation to match what could be sort of lower tonnage than maybe we've seen over the last couple of years? Adam Satterfield : No, we obviously the labor is the biggest thing to manage, and that's what we've been doing. And making sure that we are matching our productive labor cost with what our actual volume trends are. Our variable costs, if you will, are somewhere around 60 - in the low 60% range. So when you've got those other costs that are generally fixed, some of that is investments that we're making. And, again, when you get back to - we believe in the fundamentals of our business plan and our long-term strategies. So we want to make sure that we're continuing to make investments, particularly, on the real estate side that we've got the network that can handle the long-term market share growth that we believe we can win by continuing to deliver best-in-class service at a fair price. But some of those other things you just don't want to necessarily go into and [indiscernible] sort of a short-term way of thinking. But the biggest thing is we'll continue to monitor our labor cost, and then we'll continue to look at areas where we do have discretionary spending and make sure that we've got adequate control over those costs. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for the time. I appreciate it. Operator : Next is Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the detail in April. I think you said volumes are flat so far. Can you give us a little more color in terms of how weight per shipment and revenue per hundredweight ex-fuel are trending as well? Adam Satterfield : Yeah. Basically, our revenue per hundredweight, when you exclude the effect of fuel, is generally staying in a similar type of range with where we've been. It's trending around 3%. Weight per shipment continues to be down. We talked about this before that on a sequential basis our weight per shipment is kind of hanging right in there around 45, 50 range. And we'll continue to have that headwind in the second quarter. So it's trending down in kind of the 1.5% range. But overall weight per day at least month-to-date was down 0.3%. And really we anticipated this. When you have Good Friday in March, we anticipated that April will be a little bit stronger than it was. And when I look back at the last time that April was - I mean, Good Friday was in March, your April sequential trend is up more in the range of 2.5 to 3%. So we're just not seeing the same type of sequential change at this point. I think that we continue to win share every day. We've had a couple of big customers that we've lost though, and so those can have impacts on some of your trends. Ravi Shanker : Got it. And just looking back, as you've said, a bigger-picture question, how is the current environment compared to, say, 2009 or maybe past recessions? I mean, obviously, we're not in a recession, but maybe that makes it tougher. And at what point, do you decide to take a deeper hack at costs, if the environment does not improve? Adam Satterfield : Well, in 2009, our tonnage fell off like 19%. We are nowhere near any kind of a recession like we saw back then. But back to Adam's comments, we've managed our labor cost every single day. We've got the systems in place to monitor and prove our docks to match the tonnage that we're expect - tonnage and shipments we're expecting to come across the dock each day. And we might have pointed out - I think we pointed out earlier that our dock productivity has improved 6% in terms of I think the shipments per hour or the tons per hour. So, we're gaining a good productivity. We have reduced our head count since the fall by roughly 2%, which is good, but honestly we thought the first quarter would come in stronger than it did. But it did not, and it's clearly from what we've seeing so far the macroeconomic environment. We have the systems in place. We've got the management in place, and we'll - if we have to cut back more drastically, we'll certainly do so. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thank you. Operator : Next is Brad Delco with Stevens. Brad Delco : Yeah, good morning, David. Good morning Adam. David Congdon : Good morning. Adam Satterfield : Good morning. Brad Delco : Dave, how do we think about - or maybe this is for Adam, how do we think about maybe back on the salaries, wages and benefits line, the impact of shipments being up 6%, but because of declining weight per shipment, tonnage being more muted. I mean, do you essentially have to employ based on your shipment count maybe we should see - sorry, your workforce or head count adjust according to your shipment count more so than your tonnage? Adam Satterfield : Believe the answer is yes on that Brad. Because if shippers are shipping a slightly less weight on a shipper which is what's happening, when we open up the back door of a trailer and have to move shipments across the dock, we're moving them one at a time as a shipment. And if the wait on that shipment is 200 pounds less than that turns into $10 or $15 less on that shipment, our cost of moving that shipment across the dock didn't change, but we're getting $15 less. Its kind a like the guys who are pumping the oil out of the ground and getting $30 a barrel where they used to get $80 a barrel. They're cost of extracting a barrel of oil out of the ground is what it is, you can't hardly cut back on that cost. So, that is part of the pressure we're seeing on our salaries, wages and benefits. Brad Delco : And then just longer-term and I know e-commerce has been a big topic, I mean, do we think that the industry sort to have to get more intelligent on how to appropriately price some of this lighter weighted shipment that be some of the pricing pressure we're seeing or do you think it\u2019s something more than that? Adam Satterfield : Pressure that we've seen, I mean, like we've said, it continues to be relatively stable overall and it's just been like David mentioned earlier, it's been spotty in places, but it seems like it has been more sort of localized with a few accounts maybe in a few locations. So I don't necessarily think that e-commerce in today's environment is necessarily driving any changes, but back to David's point earlier, is that as shipment dynamics change you've got to understand the weight of your shipment, the dimensions of those shipments as well and we've made investments in dimensioners and competitors are doing the same thing. So, with all of the focus on the industry, we think that bodes well for pricing to remain firm and we get back to the point as well that we've made in the past that the industry, in general, is operating with, call it, single-digit profit margins. If you're not earning an appropriate return to cover your cost of capital, you're not seeing investments in capacity really other than anyone other than ourselves and so we think that that will keep pricing somewhat in check. The average makeup of that mid-single-digit margin is skewed differently in today's environment than it was back in 2006 as well. So, we think that ourselves included, but carriers that are focused on improving their profitability will continue to be disciplined with their pricing. Brad Delco : Makes sense. Then Adam just maybe housekeeping item, did you give us what March year-over-year tonnage was? Sorry if I missed that. Adam Satterfield : March year-over-year tonnage was - tons per day was down 1.6%. Brad Delco : Okay. Thanks guys for the time. Adam Satterfield : Just to clarify, we don't - some carriers may - you may have seen numbers that adjusts for Good Friday being half a day or anything like that, we count that as a full workday. So, that was skewed negatively a little bit, but we count it as a full workday. Operator : We'll now go to Matt Brooklier with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Matt your line is open; we're unable to hear you. Please check your mute button. Matt Brooklier : Sorry, mute was on. Good morning. I wanted Adam to ask another question on head count. You mentioned the 6.7% increase in head count this quarter. A portion of that was due to the change that you made in taking the durage component of your business in-house. Do have a sense for how much of the growth in head count was related to that change? Adam Satterfield : Yeah, if you sort of back those employees out that we've added, it's probably more in - the increase was between 4% to 4.5%. Matt Brooklier : Okay. And then I guess the change in model was made last year. When did that take - when do we lap? Adam Satterfield : Really more so in the fourth quarter. We started making some of those changes in the back half of the year. But really you see it more in the fourth quarter about flash themselves now. Matt Brooklier : Okay. Just going back to pricing, you mentioned that the thing is getting a little bit more competitive was kind of a reason event. Do have a sense as to when things potentially took a step down? Was it a mid-quarter event? Was it one in March? I'm just trying to get some more color in terms of when there was a change in the market. Adam Satterfield : There has not been a change in the market. There has been a competitor that has stepped up some activity of pricing in the market. And that's all as far as I am going with that. In general, when we are in the face of a soft market, all of us, we do business with nearly 90,000 unique shippers every. And all of our LTL competition has pricing in place for those shippers as well. We are all competing for a lot of the same business. And as we talked about, as you've seen in some of our numbers, when we look at our pricing per hundredweight compared to the industry going back to 2008, we tend to be a higher-priced carrier for LTL, but we have a higher value of our service. And that's why shippers have chosen us. But in a soft economy, if there is another carrier that has pricing that's a little cheaper, some shippers will shift some business to a cheaper carrier but does not necessarily mean that someone came in and cut prices. It's just the price is what it is and it has been that way. So it's not really a competitive pricing thing for somebody is coming out and try to cut prices to get our business. Okay. So it sounds like specific actions that one carrier took was a little bit more impactful here, albeit obviously the macro is not great but it sounds like it was - may have been isolated to one or maybe a couple of carriers. Matt Brooklier : Okay. Appreciate the time. Operator : We now go to David Ross with Stifel. Please go ahead. David Ross : Good morning gentlemen. David Congdon : Hello, David. David Ross : David, in looking at the stats, the inner-city miles were up almost 9%. It seemed a little high given even were shipments were and the length of the whole was - any commentary around that and what might be going on there with the network? David Congdon : Good question. I have no earthly idea. I'll be honest with you. Adam, do you have any? Adam Satterfield : Yeah. I mean some of that is last year we were still using a little bit of purchase transportation within. David Ross : Would this be part of the drayage in the inner-city miles? Adam Satterfield : No. Just in general, some of the purchase transportation we were using within our own line all network. And so as we continue to evaluate our use and we've essentially eliminated for the most part any use of purchase transportation within our own line but we continue to evaluate schedules every day and look and you know within our line haul operations to make sure that we are given the best on time service, but that there are Lane transit times or as quick as they need to be as well, so to even improve service. So I think that when we look through line haul we mentioned that they are late load average has trended down which has somewhat impacted by the decrease in weight per shipment as well, but that's an opportunity as weight per shipment normalizes and just increasing again revenue and density that's an area of improvement that we can stay focused on as we progress through the year. David Congdon : Adam, because we were really focused in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 on getting rid of purchase transportation and shifting our West Coast rail operation to company trucks and even more so reducing PT went into this year. David Ross : And then on the CapEx side, you guys are still by more trucks and trailers and almost anyone right now given the softness in the production were you guys about to get any better pricing on the trucks and trailers you can be bringing on in 2016? Adam Satterfield : Most of our orders were already in, and like many things that the pricing will get, I think is pretty fair and we're consistently buying units year in and year out. I think that would get fair pricing in any given period, but we are bringing in equipment. We brought that number down a degree. We went through and look at the number of units that we could cut out that we weren't already obligated to without any type of penalty, and so that was a piece of that $20 million decrease in the tractor and trailer CapEx, it would be consistent with what the replacement factor needs to be, but what current volume trends are as well. And buying year in and year out it keeps your fleet age sort of consistent or continuously improving, which helps on our maintenance cost per mile. as well, and if you make significant changes in one year or the next really that can create a bubble within your own buying down the road, which we think frankly is somewhat the industry may be dealing with that same type of factor, but we can always bring in equipment and get rid of maybe some of the older power units in particular that really we've put the miles on. David Ross : Excellent. Thanks. Operator : John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets is next. John Barnes : Thank you. Just one quick question. So just back on the pricing for a second. During the quarter, it seem like there was a little bit of a bifurcation in pricing, you kept hearing from the carriers themselves the pricing with the shippers seem to be still pretty firm and there was no rational activity yet on the 3PL side, it sounded like it was much more competitive in the LTL market that they were finding significantly lower purchase rates. Did you see the same between a normal shipper and the 3PL side? Did you see that bifurcation between pricing? Adam Satterfield : About 35% or more of our revenue is with 3PLs and so when you look, obviously, if that were the case, that probably had more of a negative implication on what our reported revenue per hundredweight is, but the way we deal with third-party logistics carriers is over the long run has been that we want to make sure we understand the freight that we're hauling, and it's more of a strategic relationship, and partnership if you will. And we don't look and go after transactional type business that we tried to bring into the system with them and were price maybe moving more up and down, we want to understand the customer that they are out and bringing to us what those shipment characteristics are and then we put the pricing in place that can be profitable for us and meets our margin objectives. And I think they can help us, and we can help them as well. David Congdon : And John, I will just add to that that in our relationships with our 3PLs, we have not seen an increase in activity from them coming to us trying to beat us down on price. That has not happened. They are always price conscious and trying to do the best they can for their customer, but we have not seen a step up in activity from the 3PLs, those who visit us regularly. John Barnes : Okay all right. Thanks for the color I really appreciate the time. Operator : Next is Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey, thanks good morning guys. David Congdon : Good morning. Scott Group : Adam, just back to the tonnage in April for a second, I know there is some noise with Good Friday and so just as we think about that and the comps, what's a good kind of tonnage number to put in the model for second quarter? Adam Satterfield : Yeah. I guess we aren't ready to roll out any guidance in terms of what our tonnage expectations are, but we made the comment that we thought that April would be a little bit stronger than it's been, and it's underneath when you again go back to sort of 2005, 2008 and 2013 when you had that same Good Friday occurring in the first quarter in March, we would have expected to see growth more in that 2.5% to 3% range over March, and it's more of kind of the flattish rate right now. So it remains to be seen with what the economy is doing. But I think like David mentioned earlier, we are encouraged by the fact that the ISM started increasing generally there's a couple months lagged with that. Industrial production was down last year, and so any kind of improvement we see in that industrial economy obviously would bode well for starting in May and June. So we'll have to just keep in touch with that and then obviously we'll continue to put our mid-quarter updates out and will give our main tonnage once we finish that period. Scott Group : Okay. I know a bunch of people have already asked about head count, but and I know you guys are saying you are going to do - you're looking at material, you're going to do whatever you can, should we - is it possible that we can get head count to kind of flat year-over-year excluding the trade change or is that something you want to be doing to get tonnage back in line with - to get head count back in line with tonnage? Adam Satterfield : There may be some continued decrease in total full time employees. But keep in mind, our shipments volumes have been up, and so there should be year-over-year basis probably a continued increase More importantly, what we can manage our hours as well. So we may have the people, but we may be working them less and sort of getting hours back in line as well. So that number may vary. I don't think that sequentially that will probably adding as many people in the second quarter as maybe in prior periods, but again that's going to be based on the level of growth that we continue to see in and we monitor every day. Scott Group : Okay. And then just one more if I can. In the past you talked about the 15%, 20% incremental margins and I am not sure that's the right way to be thinking about the model right now with flattish tonnage, but maybe thinking about operating margins can we improve operating margins without tonnage growth right now? Or I guess should we be expecting margins to continue to see a little bit of pressure in the next few quarters until tonnage trends positive again? Adam Satterfield : I think the 20% that we talk about last quarter is the right number to be thinking about long-term for us than when you get into long-term margin improvement, what we've talked about in the past is, you need improving density, improving yield and you need the macroeconomic environment and the pricing environment to contribute to those factors, and so, right now we just don't have all of those factors working in harmony or at least we did it in the first quarter. But so - with the investments that we've made, some of our fix cost can become a higher percent overall as revenue. And be a headwind when revenues are not as strong and frankly we need a little bit more contributing factor from the economy I think. Scott Group : Okay. All right. Thank you, guys. Operator : We'll go to Todd Fowler with KeyBanc. Todd Fowler : Great. Thanks, good morning. Just on the increase in the operating ratio here from the first quarter of last year, have you taken a look or do you have any sense of how much the impact of Easter might've been on OR year-over-year and then same sort of question how much fuel might've hit the OR year-over-year in 1Q? David Congdon : We don't necessarily try to quantify any impact from Easter and what that may have missed on vacations and work and things like that. But the fuel continues to be a headwind I would just say. As that continues to decline. I mean we dealt with it all of last year and you need to deal with it this year. What it is? It's a component of revenue and is it comes down and obviously has a deleveraging effect on other things, but it was the key driver in the 200 basis point improvement in the operating supplies and expenses. But overall, that goes into all of your direct cost and those were doing good. It's just a matter of right now our fixed cost are becoming a higher percent of revenue as the revenue levels have been a little bit softer. Todd Fowler : Okay. That makes sense. And then just with the non-LTL revenue, have you exited all of that here in the first quarter, so is the run rate that you are adding 1Q is that what we should think about throughout the rest of the year? And then can you also maybe just talk a little bit about strategically, why you made the decision to get out of some of those services? David Congdon : I will have - Adam can talk about the run rate, but I will just touch on the three services. I want to point out though that our non-LTL services are less than 2% of our total, so it's not the key driver of the company at all. It's a small portion. The drayage is starting off with that. We shut down some underperforming locations on the West Coast and Chicago, and we've had as we all know a decrease in imports, and a decrease in exports, and had some fairly significant price competition in that area. So that has impacted our revenues in drayage. Second piece is ocean freight forwarding. We hadn't in-sourced operation with our own people managing our ocean forwarding. We chose to outsource that model in a new partnership with Mallory Alexander and by the way that's going really well. But we've seen and where we were booking the entire revenue, and we're also booking purchase transportation and if we were doing the drayage purchase transportation with an owner operator for the drayage piece, and so we have seen that gross revenue and PT go down, and we're earning - we have a commission arrangement on the loads that we are outsourcing through Mallory now. And the last piece of non-LTL will be our truckload brokerage. And it's down I think primarily due to the macro environment. Truckload demand being down, but the good news is the profitability is up on that and we're making some better margins on our truckload brokerage. Those would be kind of what's going on in those areas, and as far as the run rate is concerned Adam. Adam Satterfield : Yes, I mean it's normalized now Todd. It was about $30 million revenue in the first quarter. The fourth quarter was pretty normalized as well. It was - although we still have a little bit of revenue there. The fourth quarter was about $14.5 million of revenue. Todd Fowler : Okay. That helps. And then just one last one if I could, just on the share buyback, with the expectation be that the order of magnitude is somewhat similar to the 200 million that you had previously or if CapEx comes down, could you do something greater than the most recent authorization? Adam Satterfield : I guess, I don't want to necessarily comment on that until we take our recommendations to the Board and get full approvals and once that happens we will obviously will publish that. But you can look and see. I think we stepped up are buying in the first quarter in comparison to what we've done in the past. We are purchasing about $45 million, and we've already stepped up our buying in the second quarter as well. And some of that was - we've got a 10b5 program going, but it's also opportunistic as well. When some of our share price was lower in the first quarter that was when we took advantage of that, and stepped up that volume. So I think overall though, we feel like we've got a really strong balance sheet that will continue to allow us to invest in our LTL business and continue to grow that where we've really enjoyed healthy returns. We will continue to disciplined, but we will continue to take looks at mergers and acquisition opportunity, but what we just finished is looking at ways that we can return capital to our shareholders to really improve the total return on our share price. Todd Fowler : Okay. Thanks a lot for the time this morning. Operator : Next is Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Robert Salmon : Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the question. I think, Adam, when you're talking about the market share gains that Old Dominion has experience and clearly we are seeing that with your shipment growth relative to peers out there. You had mentioned kind of a couple of big customer losses as well within that sense. Can you give me a sense of when that occurred and how we should be thinking about that in context of the April tonnage update? And any sort of color around what drove that. I'm assuming it was on the pricing side. But any additional color would be helpful. Adam Satterfield : I mean, we obviously have customers that come and go when we did have a couple of big ones that we lost and those were or probably more pricing driven than anything else. But we always evaluate customers, and we go through a bid process and our costing department is doing that every day. And I think that our win percentage on the bids that are coming through have been consistent with what we have seen in the past. But we obviously will continue to evaluate those, but those are having or had an impact in some of our first quarter trends. Robert Salmon : Okay. So it would've been towards the end of the quarter or I am assuming it's after January. But I'm just trying to bifurcate potential impact from that versus the economy softening up a little bit. David Congdon : Yeah. I mean, it sort of. It doesn't just all go away at one time. So it was somewhat happening. It happened - probably more of it was felt towards the end of the quarter. Adam Satterfield : But, again, we have nearly 90,000 unique shippers every month, and our largest customers are less than 2% of our business and we only have a couple that make even 2%. And then it's mostly 1% on down to very small percentage of our business. So we just only made the comment that we've seen some pricing pressure out there in the field on a couple of our large accounts, not that they had a significant impact on the quarter. What you saw primarily is the impact of macro economy on the quarter. Robert Salmon : I understand. I guess, as we're thinking about the variable cost there, I would imagine there will be a little bit of a short-term headwind as you adjust the network to reflect kind of some of those customer changes that we're seeing. David Congdon : On the specific locations that handled these specific accounts, we took cost out for the pickup and/or delivery cost. But as that freight flows through a network, you can't get rid of the cost when the shipments are scattered and moving all throughout a network on trailers. You do, to a degree, maybe, but you can't - you can only control the controllable - the real direct controllable cost. And we did take cost out. Robert Salmon : No. It makes sense. And, clearly, we're seeing the margins. So thank you. David Congdon : And we've seen accounts that we're operating for us - large accounts that were kind of marginal on the OR like high-90s being taken away for a 25 to 30% discount off of our net charges. And we're not going to haul something at a 120, 130 operating ratio. Robert Salmon : That makes sense. Not, certainly when your OR is on 85.9. Nice results in a tough environment. Thanks, guys. David Congdon : Sure. Operator : Next is Ari Rosa with Bank of America. Ariel Rosa : Hey. Good morning, guys. First question, I just wanted to ask about the ELD mandate. We heard some positive commentary from a lot of the truckload guys in terms of expectations for second half, maybe boosting pricing a little bit and being a little more supportive of the large national carriers who are already ELD-compliant. I just wanted to see if you guys are seeing the same thing on the LTL side. David Congdon : I think the ELD mandate is going to have more of an impact on the truckload industry. Most of the LTLs, not all, have some kind of an ELD in their trucks. There are a couple of LTLs. And you might want to ask when they have their earnings calls where they are with ELDs. But we put them in our trucks nearly - I don't know - it was 2010 - well, six, seven years ago, we put them in the trucks. And we are totally compliant and ready to roll. And if somebody has a headwind because they don't have them in their trucks, we'll haul their freight. Ariel Rosa : No. Well, I understand that you guys have it. I just meant more in terms of kind of industry-wide, is there a chance that that then reduces the amount of capacity or the available capacity? But it sounds like that's not really the case. David Congdon : I don't think so in the LTL sector. Adam Satterfield : And if it reduces capacity in truckload, obviously, that could be an opportunity of freight to... David Congdon : Yeah. Adam Satterfield : ... shift into... David Congdon : LTL. Adam Satterfield : ... the LTL mode. David Congdon : That's true. Adam. You're right. Ariel Rosa : Okay. Great. And then the second question - I just wanted to get a little bit of commentary - if you guys are seeing any major differences between geographies or customer types? David Congdon : No, it's really across the board. The only geography things that we're seeing would be in the states where the energy sector has an effect like Texas and others and Montana where the oil and gas industries have been impacted. Ariel Rosa : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll now go to David Campbell with Thompson, Davis & Company. David Campbell : Yes, good morning everybody. Thank you. Your commercials on TV are very good I think. They seem to have increased a lot in the last six months. Where are those? Where is the expense for those commercials on the P&L? David Congdon : In G&A costs. David Campbell : In depreciation and amortization? David Congdon : General and administrative cost. David Campbell : Okay. General and administrative. Okay. Would that be an area that you cut back in case the economy doesn't improve? David Congdon : It's certainly an area that could be cut back, but a lot of those are negotiated for the upcoming year under a contract basis and you cannot cut them back. David Campbell : Okay. And finally, my last question is as your expedited tonnage have been likely your other LTL tonnage have been relatively flat? David Congdon : Expedited for us is I mean, we rolled out into basically the reported numbers for LTL and it's a premium service offering for the LTL business, and we continue to do well in that area. Generally, a lot of times follows are other trends. David Campbell : It's really much the same as your other types of services. Okay. Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Next is Art Hatfield with Raymond James. Art Hatfield : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I will try to be quick David and Adam. Dave, just a quick question back on pricing, I know you've kind of beat on this, but I thought I've in one of your responses that one of the things you may be seeing as well is just not pure price cuts but customers basically parading down to a lower cost service level, is that a fair way to think about it? David Congdon : I think historically whenever the economy has gotten soft that shippers generally come more price conscious as opposed to service conscious. When things are going stronger, they ship back the other way. And so if you are a shipper and you feel like you can save a buck and your boss is saying you are the traffic manager and your boss is saying save us some money, they can be under some pressure to put some other freight on a lower cost alternative. You know, that's something we cannot measure. I'm just saying kind of anecdotally that that could be happening a little bit. And that historically if we look at how we've gained market share over the years, and times when the economy was tougher, our rate of gain of market share has been less when the economy turns around to get strong, our rate of gain in the market share is stronger. So that's kind of what I am alluding to their. Adam Satterfield : The challenge that we have is to make sure and we've seen this happen in the past that we go into the shippers and demonstrate the added value of our service. So if you're comparing an invoice or list price from us versus a competitor, if you have made some type of shift like this, what has your own time service been, as your cargo claims been, what charge back then. So when you look at basically their internal expenditures, how does that really compare from one versus the other and have a really generated any sort of savings on a total cost of ownership basis. Art Hatfield : That's very helpful. Thanks for that color. Last question just real quick, as you look at where you sit relative to your competitors, have you seen any change or any nearer when in the service gap where you set relative to what your peers have been any improvements they been able to put into their network and their services? David Congdon : We continue to focus on ourselves and getting better every day and we're proud of winning this [indiscernible] award for six straight years, and so I don't necessarily think that our competitors are sitting still. But I know that we aren't either. We're looking every day and how can we make improvements to our own service and business model, and how can we make sure that our cost structure is such that our pricing can continue to be fair for the service product that we offer. Art Hatfield : Thanks for the time today. Great. Good help, thanks. Operator : And we'll now go to Willard Milby with BB&T Capital Markets. Willard Milby : Good morning guys. Just kind of looking at quarterly trends historically you been able to improve the about 350 bips Q1 to Q2 with the market the way it is in the way you're seeing April kind of not live up to expectations, it doesn't seem like that's feasible for this 2Q, just wanted if you had any comments around that? Adam Satterfield : None specific Will, other than what we mentioned earlier that a lot of that is based on what - that improvement is based on what sequential trends and growth from a revenue standpoint is, is the revenue is building in those periods than getting leverage on our fixed costs.... David Congdon : Leverage of the density. Adam Satterfield : That's right. Willard Milby : All right. And just a few quick housekeeping things, did you give a margins yield 3.4? Adam Satterfield : Hang on a second. March 3.3% revenue per hundredweight ex-fuel. Willard Milby : Great. And you've said contract renewals for Q1 were between 3% and 4%? Adam Satterfield : Yes we continue to see our renewals in that 3% to 4% range and that's really what we believe we will continue to see as we progress through the years. We haven't made any changes in that regard for what our expectation would be. Willard Milby : All right. Great. That's it's for me. Thanks. Thank you. Operator : And there are no other questions. So I'd like to turn it back to Mr. David Condon for any additional or closing remarks. David Congdon : Thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and your support of Old Dominion and feel free to give us a call if you have any further questions. Thank you and good-day. Operator : Thank you very much. That does conclude our conference for today. I would like to thank everyone for your participation.",

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to the company\u2019s Executive Chairman, Mr. Earl Congdon. Please go ahead, sir. Earl Congdon : Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter conference call. Joining me this morning are David Congdon, Old Dominion\u2019s Vice Chairman and CEO; and Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we\u2019ll be glad to take your questions. During the second quarter, we remained focused on executing our strategic plan and customers continued to respond to our value proposition of providing on-time claims-free service at a fair price. Based on our on-time delivery of 99%, and our cargo claims ratio of 0.28% for the quarter, we continue to believe our service is the best in the industry. The economic environment remains soft however and our year-over-year results reflect the softness. We expect that our second quarter financial results will continue to outpace our industry peer group and believe our LTL tonnage represents a gain in market share, despite being down slightly from the second quarter last year. We note that the second quarter started out slower than expected in April but we began to see more of a normal sequential trend with our May and June results. In addition, the comparable quarter decline in the fuel surcharge moderated for the second quarter, a trend that we expect will continue in the second half of 2016 based on current diesel fuel prices. We also expect that the decline in non-LTL revenues will lessen in the second half of 2016 based on our timing for eliminating certain services in 2015. Before I turn things over to David, I would like to take a moment to pay our respects to Mr. Harwood Cochrane, the Founder of Old Dominion Transportation Company, who passed away earlier this week. Harwood Cochrane was I think the very best LTL trucker of his generation. And he certainly made significant contributions to our industry, And the Congdon family and the Cochrane family have been very good friends for many-many years. I\u2019d like to offer our deepest sympathy to the Cochrane family during this difficult time. Now, here is David Congdon to give you more details on the quarter. David Congdon : Thanks Earl, and good morning. From a financial perspective the second quarter was similar to the first quarter in many respects. Adam will review the specific numbers, but the basic story is that the combination of our tonnage, yield and productivity for the second quarter was not sufficient to drive operating leverage versus the second quarter of last year. Instead, the small decline in revenue had a de-leveraging effect on our income statement and increased operating costs resulted in an 80-basis point increase in our operating ratio for the quarter. We have consistently said that the key factors to long-term margin improvements are increased density, productivity and yield but a positive macro environment is necessary to support our revenue and yield growth. While our density has not increased like we would have liked this year, I am pleased with the improvement in our direct cost. We improved our platform productivity with a 3.7% increase in platform shipments per hour. And our P&D productivity metrics were flat. Our line haul latent load average decreased 2% as we continued to run schedules to meet service. And this is not an area of opportunity for us. Our yield remains steady during the second quarter with revenue per 100 weight excluding fuel surcharges up 2.7%. As Earl said, however, the economic environment remains challenging although recently reported data from ISM and industrial production has been positive. Despite the economy, we will continue to focus on the disciplined execution of our strategic plan. Our value proposition is built on providing superior service at a fair price and we do not intend to waver from this core strategy. In addition, we will continue to focus on further controlling our costs. With that said however, we will continue to make strategic investments that position us for long-term success. We invested nearly $300 million in capital expenditures during the first half of 2016 which we expect will again differentiate us in an industry that is spending far less on a relative basis. Our balance sheet remains strong with a debt to total capitalization of only 11%. To summarize, let me repeat what I\u2019ve said many times before. Our plan regardless of whether we face ongoing macro weakness or a strong environment, it\u2019s absolutely clear and has not changed. We will continue to provide our customers with superior, on-time, claim-free service and fair price. We will maintain our disciplined pricing philosophy and we will continue to make significant investments in capacity, technology and training and education for our OD family of employees. These factors all contribute to a value proposition that allows us to keep the promises we make to our customers and that they make to their customers every day. We\u2019re confident that the execution of this strategy will enable Old Dominion to continue to win market share, driving our long-term prospects for further profitable growth and increase shareholder value. Thanks for joining us today. And now Adam will review our financial results for the second quarter in greater detail. Adam? Adam Satterfield : Thank you, David and good morning. Old Dominion\u2019s revenue was $755.4 million for the second quarter of 2016, a 0.9% decrease from last year. Our operating ratio was 82.3% which was an 80-basis point increase over the same quarter of 2015. Earnings per diluted share were $0.98 which was a 2% decrease from the $1 earned in the second quarter of last year. Revenue for the second continued to be impacted by a decline in fuel surcharges as well as a $9.7 million decrease in non-LTL revenue. Our LTL revenue benefited from an increase in yield that was partially offset by a decrease in LTL tons. I don\u2019t see our revenue per 100 weight increase 0.8% for the quarter and increase 2.7% when excluding fuel surcharges While we noted an increase in price competition during our first quarter call, we did not see as many of those issues in the second quarter. And we continue to characterize the pricing environment as relatively stable. We expect that our contractual renewals will continue to increase at rates between 3% to 4%, although reported fields may differ from this range. As David mentioned, we do not intend to make any changes to our pricing philosophy. LTL tons decreased 0.3% as compared to the second quarter of 2015 which included a 1% decrease in weight per shipment, partially offset by 0.6% increase in LTL shipment. For July, on a year-over-basis, our month-to-date tell-tail tons per day decreased 1.5% as compared to July of 2015. On a sequential basis, LTL tons per day for the second quarter increased 5.3% as compared to the first quarter of 2016. While this was lower than our 10-year average sequential trend which is an 8.5% increase, we\u2019re encouraged by the sequential increases in tons per-day for May and June that were pretty much in-line with averages for years one Good Friday was in the first quarter. In addition, the sequential trend for July is in line with our 10-year average which is 2.4% decrease and LTL tons per day as compared to June. Our operating ratio for the second quarter of 2016 increased 80 basis points as compared to the last quarter of last year. The decline in revenue generally had a de-leveraging impact on all, of our expense item. However the 90-basis point increase in depreciation and amortizing costs was also a result of the long-term investment we have made in real-estate, equipment and information technology. Our overhead costs were generally higher as a percent of revenue. Our direct operating cost such as salaries, wages, benefit, operating supplies and expenses and purchase transportation improved slightly as a percentage of revenue on an aggregate basis. Year-over-year increase in salaries, wages and benefits for the second quarter was primarily due to a 2.2% increase in the average number of full-time employees and general wage inflation. Our fringe benefit costs were 31.9% of salaries and wages as compared to 35.1% in the second quarter of 2015. Fringe benefit cost in the second quarter benefited from a reduction and expense for retirement plans and were lower as a percent of salaries and wages than the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. I don\u2019t expect for this trend to continue however and believe that benefit cost will trend higher again in the second half of the year. Old Dominion\u2019s cash flow from operations totaled $123.8 million for the second quarter and $292.2 million for the first half of 2016. Capital expenditures were $175.2 million for the quarter and $295.5 million for the first six months of 2016 which is approximately 75% of $405 million estimate for the year. We repurchased $40 million of common stock during the second quarter and $84.7 million in the first half of 2016 which left us with $245.6 million available for purchase under our new $250 million repurchase program. We completed the previously authorized $200 million repurchase program in June which was approximately five months prior to its scheduled expiration. Effective tax rate for the second quarter and first half of 2016 was 38.4% compared to 38.6% for the second quarter and first half of 2015. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we\u2019ll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. We are in different locations today, so please forgive us if we talk over each other a bit. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we\u2019ll go first to Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Chris Wetherbee : Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the July month-to-date tonnage number. I was wondering if you could give us the June number, and then maybe a comment on sort of how the revenue per 100-weight actually you might be looking July month to date? Adam Satterfield : The tons per day for June on a year-over-year basis were down 0.3% and our shipments in June were basically flat, again, on a year-over-year basis. And then the revenue per 100-weight excluding the fuel, it did trend below 3%. When you look sequentially though, the absolute number for the revenue per 100-weight ex-fuel is 16.6 in the second quarter, and our weight for shipment was 15.59. If you look at the first quarter, our rate per shipment was 15.45 and revenue per 100 weight x-field was 1654. So, sequentially our weight per shipment has increased, yet our revenue per 100-weight has actually increases slightly as well. Some of what\u2019s going on with the comparison is last year, the weight per shipment was decreasing, now on a sequential basis, now we\u2019ve got it increasing so there is some different actors going different ways, that\u2019s\u2019 going to impact that overall comparison. And that continued into the back half of last year and. And we\u2019re seeing weight per shipment continuing to hold pretty steady in terms of moving enough right now. But we still feel good about the pricing environment we\u2019re still getting contractual renewals at the same rate that we were earlier in the year and feel pretty good about the environment. Chris Wetherbee : In terms of - sticking on pricing for a second - in terms of that pricing dynamic that you mentioned that you saw a little less of the pricing competition, I\u2019m guessing that probably is holding over here until at least the beginnings of the third quarter, but can you sort of speak to maybe what has changed, sort of individual carrier decisions that they\u2019re making a little bit more rationality or is their weight per shipment getting a little stronger? I mean, what\u2019s your sort of read on how things are trending from that perspective? Adam Satterfield : We said in the first quarter call that really it was selective some of the actions that we had seen that nothing was broad based. And I think carriers go through their own assessments for business they need, and different lanes and so forth. And we felt like some of the pricing actions on a few customers and a few places, didn\u2019t necessarily make sense to us. But overall we had characterized the environment as stable then. And we continue to characterize, it\u2019s stable today. So, I think there is always spotting issues regardless of the environment and nothing that\u2019s just what we were seeing in the first quarter. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, okay, that\u2019s helpful. And one quick follow-up question. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that headcount was up 2.2% in the second quarter. How should we think about sort of the year-over-year progressions in 3Q? If tonnage is down, does that number flatten out, turn lower? How can you manage that sort of on a quarter-to-quarter basis? Earl Congdon : Go ahead David. David Congdon : I\u2019ll say absolute headcount should remain relatively flat. And yes, aside from attrition that we may have - but we\u2019re looking, if we have some attrition in our headcount just for normal reasons, we\u2019ll look real strong whether we need to replace positions or not. But I would think absolutely headcount will remain relatively flat now. We\u2019re properly staffed to do the amount of work that we\u2019re doing now. I guess a lot of it will depend upon how the economy shakes out, coming out of July and into the third quarter peak season. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you for the time. I appreciate it. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Matt Brooklier of Longbow Research. Matt Brooklier : Yes, thanks, good morning. I just had a follow-up to the headcount question. Is there a number in terms of tonnage in your mind that would require you to add additional heads? Let\u2019s say that tonnage starts to pick-up, we start to see re-acceleration in the second half of this year. Is there a certain level of tonnage growth that you would need to reach before you start adding heads again to the model? David Congdon : It\u2019s hard to say that Matt. It\u2019s really, all depends on those decisions are made on the service center by service center basis. Historically coming into the third quarter, yes, July has been a pretty decent month for us last several years. But August it builds and September builds to a larger amount. We\u2019re using hiring some people for peak season in September about now but we don\u2019t necessarily gauge at it. Also we\u2019re up 5% so we\u2019re going to add x number of people. It\u2019s just stuff that we have to gauge based on the workload, hitting our service centers and how many hours per week people are working to determine if we need this more people on payroll. Matt Brooklier : Okay, but just to reiterate, with kind of the current trajectory of tonnage right now, you feel comfortable with holding headcount I guess flat going into the second half of this year? David Congdon : I wouldn\u2019t say for the whole second half. Maybe I misspoke a few minutes ago to say head count was big, fly that out. I believe from an overhead standpoint and management salaries and fixed salary standpoint, our headcount should be relatively flat. From dock workers and drivers\u2019 standpoint, I would anticipate that we will grow headcount a little bit going into the fall. But we\u2019re going to watch it because this economy just remains soft and we don\u2019t want to go overboard with too much headcount. But we got to stay ahead of it too because it takes a good couple of months to train somebody to our methods of moving freight in our network. So, we got, it\u2019s just a very careful balance. Matt Brooklier : Okay, that helps. And then just in terms of the month-to-date tonnage, it\u2019s down a little bit more than it was in June. I\u2019m trying to get a sense for - it wasn\u2019t a huge change. And obviously things can shift from month to month. Was there anything going on with the calendar that potentially impacted your tonnage, and drove tonnage down maybe a little bit more than where it was in June? Adam Satterfield : The comparison for July is probably little tougher last year. On a sequential basis, we were down 1.2%. And I mentioned the 10-year average is down 2.4%, July compared to June. So, I think that we still feel good about our sequential trends being in-line. This is basically three months in a row we talked about April in last quarter\u2019s call. But May and June and the way July is trending, we\u2019re encouraged by that as well as some of the positive economic data that\u2019s come out recently, it\u2019s not necessarily strong. But at least it has been positive. And we feel good about the fact that we\u2019ve got three months now that\u2019s back on trend and we\u2019d like to see that continue. Matt Brooklier : Okay, appreciate the time. Operator : And now we\u2019ll take a question from Ari Rosa from Bank of America. Ari Rosa : Hi, good morning, guys. So, first, I wanted to start follow-up on pricing. Last year and for the past several years there\u2019s been a pretty big step-up in sequential pricing between first half and second half. Just wanted to get your sense of, if that\u2019s likely to repeat? Adam Satterfield : Some of that though, again, if you look into last year, we had an unusual phenomenon going on with weight per shipment as that was trending down. I\u2019d say trends were 14 or weight per shipment picked up last year, it ticked down. I\u2019m looking at it more on a sequential basis. So, right now at this end, good stability and our revenue per 100-weight, a revenue per shipment continues to sort of trend in-line with where we would expect. And you\u2019re not seeing any sequential deterioration in that. And so, talking to our pricing department, they\u2019re continuing to see the same types of contractual renewals that we have been seeing. And we feel like again, as we characterize it, the overall pricing environment continues to be stable. Ari Rosa : So, Adam, when you say you\u2019re seeing it consistent on a sequential basis, does that mean kind of on an absolute basis seeing it flat? Or is that even if you can talk about July, maybe, what the trend is looking like? Adam Satterfield : I mean, it\u2019s very similar. But yes, revenue for 100-weight ex-fuel ticked up a little bit as compared to the absolute number that was in the first quarter, just active weight per shipment moved up which would in theory put negative pressure on that revenue per 100-weight number. Ari Rosa : Okay, got it. That makes sense. And then the release mentioned some changes in freight mix weighing on yields. Could you go into that a little bit more, and what it is that changes and kind of what you\u2019re shipping? Adam Satterfield : Mix changes every day, depending on what we\u2019re picking up and what customers are coming in or what customers are going out. And so, we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve had in the first quarter call little bit of customer churn. But we\u2019re replacing the customers that we lost some of them maybe coming back to us and we\u2019re bringing in new business. And that\u2019s supporting the sequential trends that we started since May. So, I mean, all of that goes into play. And we often talk about the fact that revenue per 100-weight is a yield metric and not core pricing. And so there were times when revenue per 100-weight will be lower like it was in second quarter than what we\u2019re seeing in our contractual renewals are holding. And there were times when it\u2019s been higher. So you can\u2019t always reconcile those two numbers. But we still feel good about the pricing environment and our own ability to get necessary price increases to support our continued investments here at the company. Ari Rosa : I guess, Adam, I meant more is the freight mix a reflection of anything that\u2019s going on with the economy and kind of the underlying LTL industry? Adam Satterfield : No. The revenue per 100-weight is what it is and our mix is what it is. And it\u2019s just, main thing is we manage to the operating ratio of each and every account. And yes, we\u2019ve got targeted warrants and we\u2019re signing that, we can manage to that and environment is stable. This revenue per 100-weight what is done sequentially, or what it does year-over-year is clearly an end-result of yield management process. And again, different customers give us different lanes and different consistencies of freight, different pounds per cubic foot. And that\u2019s the moving target all the time. So, you just can\u2019t focus on that and tell good or bad pricing environment based on year-over-year or sequential trends and the revenue dried away. Ari Rosa : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And now we\u2019ll go next to Todd Fowler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Fowler : Great, good morning. David, the past several quarters we\u2019ve been talking about the impact of the smaller shipments on your productivity and some of the costs associated with that. And it looks like the weight per shipment stabilized here sequentially. Do you think that the network has adjusted to the smaller shipments, and that the costs are more in line with where the shipment sizes are, or is there still some opportunity to get some efficiencies with where the shipments, with where the shipment size is trending? David Congdon : We\u2026 Todd Fowler : I didn\u2019t mean to make you sigh that deeply. David Congdon : Yes. We focus on the productivity day-in and day-out and actually hourly. And we\u2019re always working on improving efficiency. I think the points I tried to make that the, on the last call is that if you\u2019re dealing with a shipment of ways, 1,500 pounds and moving it across the dock. And now your weight per shipment is I would say 1,300 pounds and it\u2019s still three skids a freight but they\u2019re just little bit shorter or little bit less weighed on the pallets. It takes the same amount of time to move it across the dock. And so the lower weight per shipment was impacting some of those freights handling metrics negatively. And now the things have leveled out. It\u2019s maybe less of an impact. Todd Fowler : Okay. And so, when you think about if weight per shipment stays here sequentially going forward, is there still some opportunity on the productivity side, or do you think that you kind of have adjusted, and are handling the freight the way you need to, based on where the weight per shipment is? David Congdon : Yes, you can look at any, with 226 service centers there is always some service centers where productivity is not where it ought to be. And we\u2019re working to refine that and working towards improving productivity. Then, other centers might be kind of peaked out in their productivity because you just can\u2019t move a forklift in the pasture across the dock or load trailers any shack. But again it\u2019s something we\u2019re continually looking at that our productivity and weakness in productivity and any particular turmoil or any particular shift within service center or any particular individuals that are working on a ship, we\u2019re continuing addressing our productivity and striving for improvement. Todd Fowler : Okay, that helps. Maybe for a follow-up, Adam, I know that depreciation\u2019s been a bit of a headwind here in the first part of the year, because of some of the investments that you\u2019ve been making. How does that play out? I mean, are you caught up now on the fleet side, or is depreciation still going to be a bit of a headwind until revenue growth kicks back in at some point in the future? I guess, how do we think about the investments you\u2019re making in the first part of the year relative to the changes in revenue? Adam Satterfield : Yes, we definitely need the revenue to catch back up. And we will, for one thing we\u2019ve about purchased all of our revenue equipment the first half of the year which was on a little bit of an accelerated basis from prior periods. That\u2019s usually what contributes most as depreciation for the year. And there will still be some continued up-tick as it wasn\u2019t fully complete. But then you\u2019ve got the ongoing investments in IT and the real-estate which doesn\u2019t have as much of an impact on the short term on your depreciation line. But we probably bought more equipment this year than perhaps what we needed based on where our growth is. And so we continue to look at that. And as we start making preparations for next year, we\u2019ll weigh what the size of the fleet is, what our replacement needs are and what our growth may be. But we certainly would like for the top-line to catch up with where we are. Todd Fowler : Okay, but it sounds like if nothing else, you\u2019ll pulled some of that forward, and you can grow into it at some point in the future? Adam Satterfield : That\u2019s right. Todd Fowler : Okay, thanks a lot for the time this morning. And congratulations on a nice quarter. David Congdon : Thanks Todd. Operator : And now we\u2019ll go to Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. A couple of follow-ups here, and a bigger-picture question. The follow-ups would be, I\u2019m sorry if I missed this but did you give us the revenue per 100-weight ex-fuel in July and how that\u2019s trending year-on-year? Adam Satterfield : I didn\u2019t give that number yet, right now we\u2019re trending, it\u2019s trending up about 2%. That\u2019s the comments that we had made before that but on an absolute basis it\u2019s riding on with where we have been. But we\u2019ll continue to see that number potentially differ from that 3% to 4% target range that we have on true underlying pricing as compared to yield. Ravi Shanker : And that\u2019s because the funky math that you said - is because the direction of movement? Adam Satterfield : Yes, well, there is always a difference between price versus yield. But yes, the weight per shipment trend definitely impacts that. Ravi Shanker : Okay, and the weight per shipment trend, is that up sequentially or year-on-year so far in 3Q? Adam Satterfield : Right now our weight per shipment continues to trend, yes, we\u2019ve been saying since the back half of last year around 1,550 pounds. And that\u2019s basically where it continues. It was 1,559 in the second quarter. And that was up a little bit from the first quarter of 1,545 but it\u2019s somewhere around 1,550 plus or minus 10 pounds is what we\u2019ve been trending this year. But last year, particularly in the first half of the year, it was declining sequentially. Ravi Shanker : Got it. And the bigger-picture question on just e-commerce. I just wanted to clarify a few things. Can you just remind me what percentage of your revenues roughly do you guys believe comes from e-commerce? Maybe what percentage of that is from Amazon versus the other retailers? Also, what are you seeing in terms of e-commerce trends right now? There\u2019s a lot of talk about the omni-channel shift in the next year or two, especially, do you guys see that as a real long-term opportunity for you guys? Adam Satterfield : Right now, about, we\u2019ve got I would say a little e-commerce, true e-commerce freight and we don\u2019t have any last mile. I mean, we do some residential deliveries but about 15% of our revenue overall is retail. And we would focus more on freight is going into distribution centers then we would going into some residential area. But I think the long-term trends and we\u2019ve talked about this before is that, as the e-commerce, as that environment changes, I think it can ultimately drive more freight into the LTL industry. And I think that having the amount of capacity that we do and the continued investments and capacity that we would be benefactors of that. Ravi Shanker : Got it. I think it\u2019s understandable that you guys don\u2019t have much B2C last-mile e-commerce, but do you have a sense of the, when you consider the B2B kind of intra-DC moves. Again what percentage of that, the stuff you\u2019re moving comes from e-commerce? David Congdon : We don\u2019t have a breakdown on that, Ravi. Ravi Shanker : Okay, thanks for the help. Operator : And now we\u2019ll take a question from David Ross with Stifel. David Ross : Yes, good morning, gentlemen. David Congdon : Hi Dave. Adam Satterfield : Good morning, David. David Ross : Adam, if you could give us an update on the IT roll-out, the new platform I think you were migrating towards, maybe about halfway through now. Is that on plan, any issues? Adam Satterfield : Yes, we continued the work on that as a big project. I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re half way through. But that\u2019s not going to be a big bang theory kind of deal order we flip the switch and things alive. It\u2019s coming on in multiple pieces. And I think we\u2019re making progress at a pace that we have established. And there are certain applications that are being switched and turned on live from an old green screen there as application to the new world of Java and user interface screens that we\u2019ve got. So, things seem to be progressing but that\u2019s a long-term deal as we convert all of our systems, most of which are home-grown into this new programming format. But we\u2019re taking the time to do it in a way to enhance the processing capabilities and overall efficiency that we hope will drive long-term productivity for us and give us a further differentiated advantage in the marketplace. David Ross : But no negative surprises so far and everything, seems to be tracking on plan? Adam Satterfield : Yes, I\u2019d say it\u2019s tracking on plan. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s a big project. Some things are going to go better than expect, some things not as good as expected. And we just continue to work through it every day. And it\u2019s a big coordinated effort from a lot of people involved. And we\u2019ll continue to work at it. That\u2019s just one of these things though that it comes at a short-term cost. And when you\u2019re going into it, if revenue softens, that we got to stay committed to it. Because again we think it gives us long-term strategic advantage. And we\u2019re continuing to do that. So, it\u2019s higher overhead in the short-run but long-term we think it\u2019s going to be beneficial for us. David Ross : I got the June tonnage; it was down 0.3% in July down 1.5%. Did you provide April and May year-over-year tonnage comps? Adam Satterfield : Yes, April was plus 0.1%, May was down 1.0%. David Ross : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : And now we\u2019ll go to Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Rob Salmon : Hi, good morning, guys. Adam, in your prepared remarks I thought you had called out a fringe benefit in the second quarter. Can you remind us what the magnitude is at, and kind of what you guys are expecting with regard to fringe benefit inflation in the back half of the year? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I mean, the benefit costs are what they are and there is a lot of different things that they go into. The past couple of quarters I\u2019ve talked about it initially in the fourth quarter of last year that our cost had ticked up as a percent of salaries and wages. So to add a line with what the previous quarters had been. So it had ticked up sort of 33% to 34%, as a percent of salaries and wages in the fourth quarter of \u201815 and first quarter of \u201816. It was 31.9% and an element of that is retirement plan benefit cost that is linked share price. And that share price decline we got a little bit of more benefit but there is a lot of moving parts and pieces. I would just expect that we continue to see higher group health benefit cost. And our pay time-off benefits are continuing to be higher as well. So we\u2019re not necessarily giving a hard fast number but I would just expect it to be higher than that 31.9% that we saw this most recent quarter. Rob Salmon : Okay, that\u2019s helpful just from a contextual standpoint. What do you guys think is the right optimal capital structure for Old Dominion from a debt-to-cap or a debt-to-EBITDA perspective? If I think about the first half of this year, despite really front-loading the CapEx for the full year, you\u2019re still at just 11%. Basically, what I\u2019m trying to get at is how should I think about the use of that free cash flow in the back half of the year, given the lower CapEx needs? Adam Satterfield : We continue to look at that. And obviously we won\u2019t optimize our balance sheet. We finished our $200 million repurchase program early and marched into an up-sized $250 million deal. I think the last few quarters, the last 12 months I guess we have purchased close to $150 million. Our capital allocation strategy is one to invest and LTL, we think that\u2019s where the best returns have been. We\u2019ve said that we\u2019ll continue to look. Secondly, M&A opportunities, and we haven\u2019t had one since 2008 because they\u2019re just the ones that we look at haven\u2019t made sense for us. And then we\u2019ll look at returning capital to shareholders. So, I think that in absence of the right M&A opportunity, we\u2019ve increased that pace of repurchasing. But we continue to look at ways that we can make strategic investments in the company as well and we want to maintain some dry powder. But our debt-to-cap did move up to 11% at the end of the quarter from where it had been in lower single-digit. Rob Salmon : Right, makes a lot of sense. Nice execution in the tough quarter, guys. Adam Satterfield : Thank you. David Congdon : Thank you. Operator : And now we\u2019ll take a question from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. Adam Satterfield : Good morning Scott. Scott Group : So, Adam, if we assume that normal sequential volume trend continues in August and September, do you have a sense, what does that imply for third-quarter tonnage? I think it\u2019s a little bit better than the down 1.5% in July, but just want to make sure we\u2019re thinking about that right. Adam Satterfield : On a 10-year average basis, third quarter\u2019s weight per day is generally up 2%. So, if things continue to move in August and September according to normal sequential trend, that\u2019s the number that you would get. Scott Group : You\u2019re talking sequentially up 2%, so down slightly, but not down as much as 1.5% year-over-year? Adam Satterfield : Yes, the year-over-year is again, last year, we\u2019re looking at it, I think that we were a little bit stronger sequentially than just slightly than sort of the long-term average. But we\u2019ll just have to wait and see, I guess we\u2019re not ready to give a range on what we think that our total tons for the quarter would be. But again, we\u2019re looking at it. I guess now we\u2019re trying to look more as getting back on to a consistent sequential type of change with our volumes knowing that we\u2019ve mentioned it before, we\u2019ve started out some business. And we\u2019ll continue to look at that that main impact as we were growing in the last year some of the year-over-year trends. Scott Group : Okay, that makes sense. Can you remind us when and how big the annual wage increase was this year, and how that compares versus a year ago? Adam Satterfield : Well, we haven\u2019t talked about. Typically it happens the 1 September. And last year we gave about 3.5% wage increase. And we haven\u2019t announced that to our anything to our employees at this point. But based on current trends we would expect that there would be a wage increase this year. We\u2019re just not ready to talk about the amount. Scott Group : Okay, fair enough. And then, just kind of last question. So, you talked a little bit on the prepared comments about the de-leveraging impact of down revenue and slower tonnage. What is the level of either tonnage or revenue growth, where you can start to see margin improvement again on a year-over-year basis? And given the easier fuel comp, do you think we can get back to margin improvement in the third quarter, or is that tougher, just given the tonnage environment? Adam Satterfield : We\u2019re not really ready to give any guidance on where our OR is going to be for the third quarter at this point. But we\u2019ll still continue to have some headwinds on the top-line basis as we go into the back half of the year. We knew the first half of the year was going to be more challenging than the back. The third quarter will continue to, the fuel should moderate if prices stay where they are on that comparison. But a non-LTL or really it was - it was more so the fourth quarter. Those services were fully out of our number. So we still had close to or just call it $19 million of non-LTL revenue in the third quarter of last year. And while we gave that number in the first quarter, it was about $13 million and that about was what it was in the second quarter as well. So, if that continues to trend we still have that headwind there. Scott Group : But there\u2019s not a good rule of thumb in terms of how much tonnage or total revenue growth you need for to see margin improvement? Adam Satterfield : It\u2019s going to vary every year based on the investments that we\u2019re making, what the contribution to expense or depreciation is going to be, what our CapEx size is and so forth. But obviously we need more growth to start with at this point. Scott Group : Okay, thank you guys. Operator : And now we\u2019ll go to Brad Delco of Stephens. Brad Delco : Good morning, David. Good morning, Adam. How are you guys doing? Adam Satterfield : Hi Brad. David Congdon : Good. Brad Delco : David, I don\u2019t know if maybe this is best for you, but in the earlier comments I think it was mentioned that you believe your tonnage in the quarter suggest you\u2019re still taking market share. And so, I guess the bigger-picture question is, why do you think there\u2019s such disconnect between maybe the ISM data and/or industrial production relative to what we\u2019re seeing amongst LTL carriers? David Congdon : That\u2019s a good question. Obviously we don\u2019t have an answer why there is disconnect with the ISM data. ISM has improved a little bit but we just haven\u2019t seen it come through yet in terms of LTL tonnage. But why, is, I\u2019m not in Congress I have no earthly idea. Brad Delco : Now, and would you subscribe to the idea that we generally see LTL tonnage lag by about three months? I guess July would have sort of been the fifth month of when we saw the inflection to positive territory with ISM? David Congdon : Subscribed areas, they lag with the ISM data and perhaps three months sounds good to me. We had seen some improvement in our sequential trends in the last couple of months. And the logistics of that because I don\u2019t see it, the old better, the daily tonnage, the daily shipments that we\u2019re seeing feel better every day when we kind of look at how much business we get each day. And so, but Adam, touch on the overall sequential trends we\u2019re doing recently. Adam Satterfield : I mean, as we went through the second quarter, our weight per day was up 0.6% in April versus March. The 10-year average was up 0.3% but remember this is, and into the last quarter where I have talked about it, but with the Good Friday in the first quarter, these are thrown off. And we would have expected that number to beef up more. Weight per day in May was up 2.1% versus the 4.7% average and it was up 2.4% in June versus the 2.3% average. And shipments were more in line and we talked about that when we put our mid-quarter update, shipments per day in May was up 2%. And when you just look at years when Good Friday was in the first quarter, the average is 1.4% for us. So we felt good about the way May\u2019s revenue built. From start to finish we saw a similar trend in June. And July pretty much has been very similar as well. And so, things are still a little bit better and perhaps what we are seeing though is once ISM turned back and stayed above 50, pretty much consistently in March forward that maybe supportive of these trends. Brad Delco : Okay, got you. Thanks for the color, guys. Operator : And now we\u2019ll go to David Campbell of Thompson Davis & Company. David Campbell : Yes, thanks for taking my question. This issue of non-LTL revenue, which you too were down, I guess you were down about $6 million year-over-year in the second quarter. And it\u2019s from business services that you terminated near the end of last year. What were those services, and why did you terminate them? David Congdon : It was two things David. One was where we pulled back our ocean container dredge operations off the West Coast. We discontinued those as well as Chicago. The second; non-LTL change has been with our global freight forwarding where we were booking the entire revenue of the additional containers and the purchase transportation against that. And we have partnered with Mallory Alexander to manage our ocean forwarding now. And so we don\u2019t have that top-line revenue. We\u2019re getting a, we work basically off of a commission type basis on the net revenue. So those are the two primary areas. Adam, did I miss anything? Adam Satterfield : That\u2019s it. I\u2019ll add that the decrease in second quarter was $9.7 million, not the $6 million that was mentioned. David Campbell : $9.7 million? Adam Satterfield : Yes. David Campbell : And those are likely to continue in the third quarter, and then be less in the fourth? Adam Satterfield : Right. David Campbell : Okay. So, some of it is in, sort of an accounting thing, where you\u2019re just picking up commissions instead of grossing the revenues. It\u2019s not really a reduced - it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve really reduced services, you\u2019re just partnering with somebody else? David Congdon : That\u2019s correct. David Campbell : Okay, thank you for the help. Have a good third quarter. Thanks for the good second quarter. David Congdon : Thank you. Adam Satterfield : Thanks. Operator : And now we\u2019ll go to Taylor Brown with Raymond James. Taylor Brown : Hi, good morning, guys. Hi Adam, just quick housekeeping item. Can you guys give the service center count at quarter-end, and actually in Q1, if you have it? Adam Satterfield : That was 225 at the end of the first quarter and I think it\u2019s 226. Taylor Brown : Okay, all right. Okay, perfect. And then, David, can we talk a little bit about the real estate CapEx. So, you guys mentioned in the release that you\u2019re looking to spend $170 million earmarked for facilities. I think that\u2019s the highest budget we\u2019ve seen. I\u2019m just curious if you could talk about how tight land and facility availability is, with industrial occupancy nearing all-time highs. Are you guys seeing the cost per door, whether you acquire it or build it, rise significantly? David Congdon : Well, acquiring land and building a freight service center has been a problem, a difficult endeavor for the last 30 years that I could remember. So, and I believe it always will be unfortunately enjoys to close on their back, the foods that they eat, they just don\u2019t want to see the truck bring the products in. But so, our cost per door on construction has definitely risen, of various environmental concerns, neighborhood concerns, landscaping, storm-water run-off, all those kinds of things have caused a cost for a door to rise. As far as the acquisition of used facilities, one of the issues we face today is, most of the facilities that are out there on the market are just not big enough for us. And if we\u2019re lucky enough to find one that has some additional land then we can run them and add doors. We found that to be the case from time to time. So, it\u2019s - real estate is always a challenge. And historically we talk about real estate budget but historically we\u2019re going usually spend what we say we\u2019re going to spend. And year-to-year because of the time delays and acquiring land and getting through the permitting processes and so forth. Taylor Brown : Okay, yes, now that\u2019s great. And then, can you give any sense how much door capacity you guys are looking to add this year? David Congdon : Do you have that Adam? Adam Satterfield : No, and we don\u2019t necessarily break that down Taylor. But I would say that the investments that we\u2019re making are generally more and expanding in existing locations. The fact that we\u2019ve only added one facility this year, it\u2019s primarily been expanding the existing locations in their dollar amount. But we may add a couple of more facilities this year. Taylor Brown : Okay, perfect. Thanks guys. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Ben Hartford of Baird. Ben Hartford : Hi, good morning. Adam interested in any perspective you might have on bids in the back half of the year. Are you hearing any talk from customers regarding potentially pulling forward bids that might hit in the fourth quarter or early next year into the third quarter? Adam Satterfield : We haven\u2019t heard anything like that. Bids for us, it\u2019s not any kind of seasonal thing. They come in on a fairly regular basis throughout the year. And this is something that constant communication that you have with our customer base and between our pricing department and our sales department as well. Ben Hartford : Sure, and then a follow-up on the last question. The long-term service center count, are you still targeting 250 to 260? Adam Satterfield : Yes, I mean, obviously that\u2019s going to vary as we grow and get bigger and we may find that we need spin-off locations. But right now I think that we\u2019ve got another 35 to 40 facilities when we think long-term we may grow to. And there is probably going to be some ebb and flow there as we continue to make our way and achieve our long-term growth objectives. But right now I add to that, probably the capacity in the system that we have is somewhere in the ballpark of 25% plus or minus. Ben Hartford : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : And now we\u2019ll go to Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Jason Seidl : Thanks, good morning, guys. Just a quick one here. In the past, when truckload capacity has tightened its impact at the LTLs, in terms of different freight shifting around the move, if truckload continues to tighten, should we see a similar impact that we\u2019ve seen in the past with you guys? What do you think it might do for your pricing in that sort of in that 3% to 4% range? Could that boost it any? Adam Satterfield : Jason, our pricing philosophy is that we target the increases that we need on a fairly consistent basis to just be in line with what our cost inflation is. And so I think that there have been periods where maybe the industry is going up more, it\u2019s based on capacity or they may be cutting rates from an environment that\u2019s - capacity has flipped. And their needing to get that volume. And I think our customers like our consistent approach. And we\u2019ve had good success with them. Jason Seidl : Okay, now that\u2019s fair enough. I guess, one follow-up. I mean, you guys touched on it briefly about looking at some ancillary opportunities to tack on with acquisitions. What are the ones that you think would fit most? Is it still something in maybe the warehousing mode, or is there anything else that we should be thinking about that would make sense for OD? Adam Satterfield : Yes, it varies. We obviously continue to look Jason and try to figure out what we think would maintain this long-term for us. And we\u2019re doing a couple of different things here as it is. I mean, LTL is really the growth engine of the company. And first and foremost, we\u2019ve only got 8% to 9% market share. So we\u2019re going to continue to focus on this long runway of growth that we have within LTL. There are other services that are complimentary, those other non-LTL services that we have today are the dredge which we\u2019ve changed our business model and we\u2019re trying to focus and be able to capture coming growth and maybe changes in capacity within that marketplace. We\u2019ve got the truckload brokerage operation we can continue to enhance that offering. Really we\u2019re going to focus on things that are complementary to our LTL business. And maybe a service that when we\u2019re making sales calls on a decision maker at our existing customers, that we can leverage those relationships. Jason Seidl : All right. Gentleman, I appreciate the time. Adam Satterfield : Yes, okay. Operator : And we\u2019ll go back to Ari Rosa of Bank of America. Ari Rosa : Hi, guys. Just wanted to sneak one last one in. On some of the pricing initiatives that you took kind of at the end of last year, specifically thinking about the changes in the way or having a change in the fuel surcharge option. And then also looking at some of the surcharges going into and out of California. Just wanted to get a bit of a comment on how those are being received by customers, if you\u2019ve gotten push-back, if they\u2019ve generally responded well? Just thoughts, generally? Adam Satterfield : Yes, I mean, some of those things and changes that were made is just as it always, we\u2019re looking at what our costs are doing. And the industry change, fuel surcharge, rate early in \u201815. And we had just gone through a GRI and felt like that it wasn\u2019t the right thing to do to sit across our customer and say that fuel is going down but we need a rate increase. And so, we\u2019ve worked through that but the fuel surcharge has just become a variable component of pricing. And like David mentioned, earlier in the call, is that we\u2019ve got target ORs for our customers and we\u2019re managing base rates. And any type of auctorial charge based on what the cost of handling that customer\u2019s business is. And so, that\u2019s been a consistent approach that we\u2019ve had. We try to put in spare price in programs that\u2019s beneficial for both parties involved and continue to support the growth of our company. Ari Rosa : Anything on adoption rates of the alternate pricing structure? Adam Satterfield : Are you speaking of that new tariff that we put in? Ari Rosa : Yes, for the alternative fuel surcharge arrangement. Adam Satterfield : Yes, that\u2019s been pretty small in terms of acceptance. But we went through that process of identifying it and working through it because there were some customers that wanted to switch and not have that fluctuation in variance with our fuel and have to update their systems every week as the DOE price is changing.  So it\u2019s been responded to by some customers that really were asking for it. But we didn\u2019t really anticipate that that would become widespread in the most adopted tariff option that we have. Because we\u2019ve got multiple tariff options. But our 559, the most traditional one continues to be what most of that business moves on. Ari Rosa : Okay. That\u2019s terrific. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Operator : And with that that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to Earl Congdon for any additional or closing comments. Earl Congdon : Well, guys, as always, thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and your support of Old Dominion. So, please feel free to give us a call if you have any further questions. Thank you and good day. Operator : And again ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s call. We\u2019d like to thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to the Company\u2019s Executive Chairman, Mr. Earl Congdon. Please go ahead, sir. Earl Congdon : Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. With me this morning are David Congdon, Old Dominion\u2019s Vice Chairman and CEO; and Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we\u2019ll be glad to take your questions. We are pleased with the improvements in our overall results of the third quarter, although the environment remains challenging. We produced new company records for quarterly revenue, net income and earnings per share, in addition our 82.4 operating ratio was just 30 basis points short of our best OR ever in the third quarter of last year. o achieve these results, in a quarter, total tons declined for the second consecutive quarter, and shipments declined for the first time in seven years, it is a real tribute to the hard work innovation and flexibility of our OD family of employees and also highlights the Company's long-term operating strength, which begins and end with our commitment to providing superior customer service at a fair price. We have also maintained would a steady investment in capacity and technology while most importantly continuing to invest in our people, which include providing the tools and training for them to be successful on their job as well as with 3% wage increase that we awarded to our employees in September. I've experienced per share of challenging operating environments and have learned the importance of remembering that the economy will eventually get better. As a result, we are a company that focuses on the long-term. We have built Old Dominion with core operating philosophies that drive long-term success, and we are fortunate to have the financial strength to implement these customer focused strategies throughout the economic cycle. Since our model has consistently outperformed our peers, in both good and bad environments, we continue to keep focus on executing our strategic plan and remain confident that we can increase our long-term market share, profitability and shareholder value. So, thanks for joining us this morning, now here is David Congdon to give you more details on the quarter. David Congdon : Thanks, Earl, and good morning. As Earl mentioned, we did see slight improvement in our financial results for the third quarter and have several reasons to be encouraged, as we enter the fourth quarter. To start off with, we continue to deliver superior service that our customers value with over 99% on-time deliveries and a cargo claim ratio of 0.28% in the third quarter. Our revenue increased slightly for the quarter primarily due to strong yield performance in a stable pricing environment. In addition, the headwinds that we faced in the first half of the year from the declining fuel surcharges and non-LTL revenues have moderated. Our non-LTL revenues declined on average of 9.3 million for both the first and second quarters of 2016 as compared to the respective periods of 2015. The third quarter decrease was 6.4 million. This year-over-year decline should be further reduced in the fourth quarter as we fully cycle through the strategic changes made to our international freight forwarding and container drayage service that began in the second half of 2015. Our LTL revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharge increased 2.7% for both the second and third quarter. The increase in the third quarter felt stronger to us; however, as the 0.5% increase in weight per shipment and the 0.2% decrease in average length of haul, both put downward pressure on this yield metric. We also saw a good productivity improvement on the platform as tons per hour increased 5.9% and shipments per hour increased 4.7%. P&D metrics were flat for the third quarter and the line haul latent load average declined 1.4%, as we continued to run schedules to meet customer service expectations. We are operating at very efficient levels. We have an opportunity to improve productivity in future period, especially as our LTL weight per shipment increases. Offsetting these improvements, we have 1.3% decline in LTL tons for the core following a slight decline in the second quarter. We believe the decline in LTL volume continues to be more a function of soft economic environment than anything else. The decline in volumes caused us the loose freight density, which contributed through the increase in our operating ratio for the quarter, despite otherwise excellent control over our variable cost. As I have said many times, long-term profitable growth requires four key ingredients improvement in density, yields and productivity, all within a positive economic environment. We can't control the economy. We will continue to focus on the disciplined execution of our strategic plan to provide the service at a fair price. We will continue to invest in capacity, technology and people. And we will continue to focus on further controlling our cost. Taking care of our customers and employees, our long-term experience shows that we are positioned to keep the promises we made to our customer and reinforced that they make to their customer every day. We also know from experience that the consistent execution of our strategic plan to help us win additional market share leading to long-term profitable growth and increase share holder value. Thanks for joining us today. And now, Adam will review our financial results for the third quarter in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, David, and good morning. Old Dominion\u2019s revenue was a company record $782.6 million for the third quarter of 2016, which is a 0.4% increase from last year. Our operating ratio was 82.4% which was a 30-basis point increase over the third quarter of 2015. Earnings per diluted share were $1.03 which was a 4% increase from the $0.99 of earnings per share in the third quarter of last year. Increase in revenue for the third quarter reflects increased LTL revenue that was partially offset by the $6.4 million in non-LTL revenue. LTL per hundredweight increased 2.5% for the quarter and increased 2.7% when excluding fuel surcharges, as the pricing environment has remained stable. We implemented our general rate increase on tariff business affective September 26th, and we will continue to target rate increases on our contractual account to average between 3% to 4% to offset our own cost inflation. LTL tons per day decreased 1.3% as compared to third quarter of 2015. As our LTL shipments per day decreased 1.8%, the first such decrease into the fourth quarter of 09 while our LTL weight per shipment increased 0.5%, the first increase into the fourth quarter of 2014. On a sequential basis, our LTL tons per day for the third quarter increased 1.2% as compared to the second quarter of 2016. This was slightly below of our 10-year average sequential trend, which is a 1.9% increase. Month-to-date for October, our LTL revenue per day has increased slightly on year-over-year basis as we continue to see good yields performance. This was offset by a 1.8% decrease in LTL tones per day however. Our operating ratio for the third quarter of 2016 increased 30 basis points as compared to the third quarter of 2015. As we have discussed the past couple of quarters, the increase in our operating ratio was primarily caused by the deleveraging effect on our fixed cost resulting from the flatness in our revenue. In particular, depreciation and amortization cost increased 90 basis points as a percent of revenue in the third quarter. These costs are the result of the long-term investments we have made in real-estate, equipment and information technology. On the positive side, we were once again pleased with the improvement in our variable operating cost as a percent of revenue. While these costs improved in the aggregate, our salaries, wages and benefits did increase for the third quarter, primarily due to increase fringe benefit cost in general wage inflation, as the average number of our full-time employees decreased 1.4% for the quarter. As anticipated, our fringe benefit cost increased to 34.4% of salaries and wages from 32.0% for the third quarter of 2015, and we expect these costs to remain elevated again in the fourth quarter. Old Dominion\u2019s cash flow from operations totaled 117.9 million for the third quarter and 410.1 million for the first nine months of 2016. Capital expenditures were 55.6 million for the quarter and 351.1 million for the first nine months of 2016, which is approximately 87% of the 405 million estimate for the year. We repurchased $34.3 million of our common stock during the third quarter and a 190 million in the first nine months of 2016. These purchases left us with 211.3 million available for purchase under our current $250 million repurchase program. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 37.2% compared to 38.4% for the third quarter of last year due to several discrete tax adjustments. We expect the effective tax rate to be 38.4% again in the fourth quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we\u2019ll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Jason Sidel. Your line is open. Jason Faizal : Quick question about the weight per shipment, I mean, I think, it's a good sign right that we've seen it, pickup for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2004. But I think in our own comments, you mentioned that we're still seeing a very challenging market. Is it challenging, but getting slightly better? I am trying to figure out why the weight per shipment would have picked up because you one other competitor that reported thus far had good results, but there way per shipment trended down again as well? David Congdon : Sequentially, it's staying about the same, it's just that we're' finally lapping over a period last year where, if you recall, it was coming down throughout the year and then stabilized in back half of the year. So, the weight per shipment in the third quarter was \u00a31,551. In the second quarter of this year, it was \u00a31,559. So, we've kind of seen it stabilized around this sort of \u00a31,550 range, and it's been sort of plus or minus \u00a310. But it did drop a little bit in August and then sort of came back in September, and it's trending well in October thus far as well. So, I think, we still continue to see the economy is stable with prior periods, not really improving, not really getting worst, but we're at least happy to see that the weight per shipment has stabilized. Jason Faizal : And my follow-up is going to be around the new overtime law that's coming into effect here, what kind of an impact might that have on your business, if any? Earl Congdon : The total number is not big deal for us. I think we had somewhere in the neighborhood a 150 may be affected people. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Group. Your line is open. Scott Group : Adam, just on the October tonnage, do you have like the sequential change versus the 10-year history on that? Adam Satterfield : Yes, in October or September? Scott Group : I guess we'll take both? Adam Satterfield : Yes, in September, we were up 3.6% over August versus the 10-year average above 2.8%, but recall that August was below trend. And then thus far in October, on a weight per day basis, we are trending down about 4.5%, and that is compared to the 10-year average was down 3.5%. So, it's kind of back to this choppiness and our volumes are little bit lighter in October than perhaps what we thought we might see, but our yield performance is good, and as I mentioned, the revenue per day October this year versus last year is better. David Congdon : Scott, I would like to add, this is David. A little commentary on our sequential averages, our 10-year in particular, you might recall that in the early 2000s, we were expanding geography year-after-year. Our last acquisition was in Montana in 2008, which is -- so, we\u2019ve got some geographic expansion in our 10-year history. And then you might also consider YRC in 2007, 2008, I believe had about $10 billion in sales, and they went to 5 billion or less in sales. And even as their economy has come back, they have not -- and the overall tonnage in LTL has come back. They didn\u2019t get that freight back, so what freight they lost I think has probably shifted around amongst the various carriers. But right now, we don\u2019t have the effect of a $5 billion worth of YRC revenue hitting the market by now because they're stable. So, when we talk about our sequential trends versus a 10-year average, it's a tough comparison. Scott Group : Yes, that actually makes a lot of sense. So, I guess just to follow up on that point, David. Is it fair then to think that the pace of share gains going forward realistically, it's just not going to be the same as what we saw in the past, if you're not expanding geographies and YRC shares more stable? David Congdon : We will continue to expand geographies to it well -- I mean, we are in the 48 states, but we have a plan for 35 or 40 more service centers, which will increase help us increase our density and share of the outbound freight in the markets where we will be putting a service centers. But we've got that that ahead of us, and the fact that we continue to invest in future capacity for growth, and we have the capacity for growth, and we have had the capacity for growth over the last decades. We think that that strategy will allow us to keep winning market share. In the soft economy, our rate of gain of market share has gone down because frankly shippers are economizing. And all those 90,000 active shippers we have every month probably 95% of them have the other LTL carriers and they're stable as well. Pricing that might be cheaper than ours and perhaps they are choosing to ship certain shipments for a lower price. But we believe, we are the best disposition carrier as the economy turns around with most capacity to absorb the growth. Scott Group : If I could just ask one last one. So, we typically think about higher fuel as a positive for your and just broader LTL earnings, is that start to play out in the fourth quarter? Is anything to keep in mind might not be the case, right now? Adam Satterfield : Yes, fuel prices are certainly moving north. We still, in terms of, where prices are today that to the average deal rate price was $2.50 in the fourth quarter of last year. So, we're starting to approach that number the last couple of week, but we are still sort of even or slightly below what the average price was last year. But certainly, it helps leverage all of our other fixed cost, if revenues are increasing. And we saw a little bit of that play out in the third quarter. As prices started to rise, it helped the top line and we did have as much of headwind on top line basis from the decrease in fuel that we've seen in the past two quarters. Operator : Thank you. We will move next to Chris Wetherbee. Your line is open. Chris Wetherbee : I want to get a sense of -- I apology, if I missed it. But did you give September tonnage on a year-over-year basis just want to make sure I got that? David Congdon : On a year-over-year basis, it was down 1.2%. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And so when you think about sort of the dynamic of September versus October, is this sort of indicative of kind of bounce along a bottom or trough in terms of the tonnage dynamic? Just wanted to get a sense, I want to overplay sort of month-to-month comparisons, but just want to get a sense with what's going on the weight per shipment, if you do feel like there is anything different or changed and customers are giving any indication to that respect? David Congdon : I don't think so. Last October was a little bit of an odd months for us. Our weight for shipment dipped down. Weight for shipment in October last year was only 1,529 pounds, and it came back stronger in November and December, but things feel normal. We do have one last workday in this October than last year and sometime that call some slight change with the metrics. But things feel about same to us, and certainly, we're pleased with the way September closed out. We felt good about those trends, but when you look through the economic numbers whether it's industrial production or whatever, we've kind of had some months of up and down. And I think that's what we're kind of seeing in our volume trend. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. David Congdon : Our yield continues to perform very well, so our revenue per day is hanging in there pretty good. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Yes, that makes sense and that was I want to follow up on -- it seems like you might have some headwinds to the reported yields numbers despite that you had sort of flattish on a sequential basis. When you think going forward, can you maintain sort of the pricing dynamic that we're seeing, revenue per hundredweight ex-fuel, is that type of dynamic you've talked about. I think renewals in the three to four range, but just kind of get a sense of maybe how you see that tending out in your next couple of quarters? David Congdon : We certainly are going to stick to our guns and our pricing philosophies that it worked for us in the past. And when you look at it, the absolute revenue per hundredweight number ex-fuel was higher in third quarter than it was in the second. We continue to deliver a value proposition we think and are going to continue to deliver the very best service in as per fair price and return than allows us to continue to make the investments in our company. But we see things as fairly stable in the market, and we'll continue to target increases that we need offset our cost inflation. Operator : Our next question comes from Allison Landry. Your line is open. Danny Schuster : Hi. Good morning. This is Danny Schuster for Allison. I was wondering if you can share with us your updated 10-year average sequential trends for November and December? David Congdon : Sure. In your average in November is a 3.2% increase and the 10-year average for December is a 9.2% decrease. Danny Schuster : Okay. And based on your previous commentary with respect to just YRC and geographic expansion not being and there should we expect sequential trends to be a little bit light of those trends? Or were you just making that comment in reference to the October trends? David Congdon : I think that was just the general comment. I mean, those are obviously based in the numbers. This year, our volume trends have been lower than what the 10-year average when you just look at on a quarterly basis. And I think a lot of that as a reflection of the economy, but for the third quarter you certainly have your normal seasonality played out. And from a weight per day stand point, we were up 1.2% over the second quarter. And as I mentioned that from a quarterly standpoint, that average was at 1.9%. Fortunately getting back to the yield from just overall revenue per day standpoint, the 10-year average increase in revenue per day, over the second quarter is 3.3%, and that's where we're for the quarter. So, we had a little bit softer volume performance than longer term trends. But our yield performance was a little bit better, so our revenue per day was right in line with sort of our long-term average to seasonality trends. Danny Schuster : And then just from modeling purposes, would you mind sharing the quarterly workdays for 2017? David Congdon : Yes, for 2017, we do have one less workday overall. There will be 64 days in the first quarter, 64 days in the second quarter, 63 days in the third quarter which we had 64 this year, and then 62 days in the fourth quarter of 2017. Operator : Our next question is from Ravi Shanker. Your line is open. Ravi Shanker : Are you surprised to see the pricing or stability at the levels you're seeing right now? And does that bode well for bigger GRIs as the market improves? David Congdon : We haven\u2019t been surprised. We talked all year that we thought that LTL pricing would remain stable for a few key reasons, and it's the consolidation of the market. And then, when you look at where average industry margins are and basically where capacity is, we felt like those three scenarios would be supportive of better LTL pricing. Truckload pricing has obviously suffered a little bit this year and there may have been some volume swap from LTL into truckload for that very reason, on some of the higher weighted LTL shipments. But we felt like the industry needed to continue to push price because we feel like the other industry participants need to continue. When you look at some of the density metric, about every carrier has made improvements from the revenue per service standpoint. But it's the improvement that needs to come from the yield that can lead to better margins, and a margin that can support reinvestment. Ravi Shanker : Is there room for upside as the market improves or do you think it's going to stabilize at these levels? David Congdon : That's hard to say. Our pricing philosophy is, we ask for rate increases to really offset what cost inflation and what the profitability on each customer account is. And so we feel like, we can sit across the table and have those conversations and that's what we'll continue to do. And we've mentioned in our prepared remarks, we are going to continue to target contractual increases in that 3% to 4% range that we've been able to get the last couple of years. Ravi Shanker : Great. And just a last one. How do you think about CapEx in the lower term and clearly step down this year? Again, is this the right level to think off on an ongoing basis? David Congdon : Broadly, from equipment standpoint, we overinflated a bit this year for our expected volume. Look and the economy didn\u2019t come through, and so as we look -- we are not giving out the CapEx number yet today. But we are looking more at our equipment number that would be for our replacement program. And then if the economy turns and gets better, we could up that number during the year and start adding some equipment for growth. But right now, we are just looking at our replacement program and equipment for next year. Our real-estate is still fairly substantial and maybe a little bit more than last year. And technology is all a little bit from 2016. So, we do anticipate a lower CapEx, but still substantial CapEx when we finalize our numbers and see how the fourth quarter goes and report to you in January. And we will give that number after then. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Brooklier. Your line is open. Matt Brooklier : So just a question around the truckload market, we've seen improvement on a truckload side of things. So let's call since June-ish directionally, it's been kind of moderate, but there has been some improvement there. So I was just curious to hear, if the change in the truckload market, if it had any impact on your business whether be from a volume or price perspective? David Congdon : Not, any material way. I think that some of that movement just sort of happens on the fringe and I don\u2019t know that we are really only other LTL carriers have seen any significant movement because I still think that there is probably oversupply right now in the truckload area. Matt Brooklier : Okay. And then Adam, do you have the service center count for 3Q? Adam Satterfield : It was 226 service centers. Matt Brooklier : 226 okay, appreciate the time. Operator : Our next question comes from Ari Rosa. Your line is open. Ari Rosa : So, first question I wanted to start on the operating ratio. You mentioned the economy continues to be a bit tepid, but wondering what kind of OR levels you think you might be able to reach, if some volume growth returns. Obviously, there is descent amount of operating leverage embedded in your business and you're hitting at operating levels that are pretty impressive right now. I think you said close to record, so I just wanted to hear your thoughts on what kind of improvements we might see as volume growth returns? David Congdon : We believe that if the economy return and get more positive that -- and we continue improving density yield and productivity that there is more leverage to continue bringing our operating ratio down. How low can it go? We don\u2019t give a number on that. But we do believe that there is more margin improvement ahead, if we have all four key ingredients in the stars aligned, if you will. Ari Rosa : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just, I am thinking about the competitor dynamics, one of your competitors noted in intention to expand their geographic footprint. Obviously, some of your the other competitors talking about being aggressive in terms of growth. Just wanted to hear your thoughts on what the state of the competitive landscape looks like, and if it changed versus say 12 months ago? David Congdon : That hasn't exactly changed because they haven't opened up those service centers up north yet. I know who you're referring to. But I\u2019ll tell you that I think, they got their work cutoff for it. It's a difficult environment and they are up again and extremely strong service competition. We would be number one in that category of strong service competition. And then, you have a couple of other private carriers that are really strong in the East South markets. And if they don't give the service, they're going to have a hard time building the density in the lanes. And if they resort to reducing prices to get density then the profitability won't be there, and they're going to have a tough time with their operating ratio. So, it's not going to be easy. Ari Rosa : And then if I can just speak one more in, I want to understand you mentioned obviously YRC, some of the challenges that they've experienced over the past several years. Looking forward, where do you see market share gains coming from? Is there a singular source or where can market share go from here, I guess, and what would be the source of that growth? David Congdon : We are continually bringing on new accounts that we've never done business with. And we usually start with a lane or a couple of states maybe for an account. And as you build our relationship and prove yourself, you can then grow into additional states for those accounts. The accounts that we do business with to-date, we have a lot of additional market share gains that we can achieve just within our existing account basis well. So, it's just a matter of serving the customer, building your relationships, giving them the premium service at a fair price. And we think that formula, it has worked well for us. We think it will continue to work. Operator : Our next question is from David Ross. Your line is open. David Ross : Adam, can you talk about the insurance market right now? We first-term some other carriers that premiums are going up significantly, but you seem to be holding line flat on the insurance and claim side. Are you not seeing that or is your contract up for renewal later this year? And comments you have there will be great. Adam Satterfield : We've dealt with that earlier this year really in the first quarter and we were right frankly on the bleeding edge of when some of those carriers exited the market and had to go out and get replacement coverage. We've got good insurance programs. We've got good safety records. And that helped us find some replacement carriers. And fortunately, we didn't have to take too much of a premium increase like may be some of our competitors did. But that's already baked in to, we go through our insurance renewal process in the first quarter and so we live through that earlier this year. David Ross : Is that an annual process or multiyear process? Adam Satterfield : It's an annual process. David Ross : Okay. And then David, anything you're seeing on the regulatory sides are floating around DCs being talked about that concerns you or excites you about the business? David Congdon : Yes, I think we have a pretty good chance of getting the hours of service back where they ought to be, where we want them with the 34 -- with unrestricted 34 hour restart. I think we also have a pretty good chance of getting the F4A legislation passed again that cause us for. The states not to be able to create their own laws that affect us when we go into this state or that state with our interstate drivers. So, I think those are two wins ahead, are also going to put a plug in for ATA and Chris Spear. I think he is going to do a heck of good job and he has a heck of good plan for the leadership of ATA. He's built a super team. And I think where we have probably the -- we have and will have the strongest ATA on Capitol Hill that we never had before. Operator : Our next question is from Todd Fowler. Your line is open. Todd Fowler : Can you talk about how much residential or home delivery you are doing and I'm not talking about home moving, but actual delivery to homes probably from B2C type environments? And how you view that market either for you or for the LTL space going forward? David Congdon : You hit a very-very small piece of our customer base delivering to homes. We do have the capability of delivering to homes because we have liftgate trailers in every single one of our service centers, not just one that multiple liftgates. So, we can't go into the neighborhoods and we do. But I guess it will be a growth as projected to be a continuing growing market. The problem is going to be when Amazon and others sell it based on free delivery. There is nothing free about making a home delivery and the numbers have to work out. We have accessorial charges and so forth now for our residential deliveries that work for us but it's not -- we certainly can do it for free. Todd Fowler : So, it sounds like a capability that you have, but it's not an area that you are aggressively focused on or at least you're kind of maybe the margin or the price point right now? David Congdon : Talk about strategically and have for the last several years, but we are not actively focused on it at this point. Todd Fowler : Okay. That helps. Just two expense of cost ones. Adam is the depreciation run rate here in the third quarter is that caught up given the investment and rolling stock in the first half of the year, does that continue to move up? And then just the second one, you mentioned the fringe cost being elevated, can you talk a little bit more about what that's related to and does that remain into 2017 or is that just something from our cost during the back half of the year? Adam Satterfield : First, on the depreciation, there might be a little slight uptick as we go into the fourth quarter. Most of that is in at this point as we've got primarily the revenue equipment that is delivered through the quarter, but still some of that was coming online late in the quarter. And we still got a few some replacement trailers that will be coming in the fourth quarter as well. So that will take up sequentially a little bit, not that much, and then on the fringe side something that we've struggled with really it started its fight in the fourth quarter of last year. And it was related primarily -- there is a lot of movement in those categories, but it's primarily related to our group health and dental and those have just been in unfavorable position for us really back to again the fourth quarter. So, it's something we are working at. I would expect and to be to continue into the fourth quarter, and if you recall last quarter, it was better. But that was really on some retirement benefit plan caused time tied to stock price. So, the health should or likely will continue whether or not, it continues in the 2017 is a question. We are focus on it. We are meeting internally and talking about ways that we can make changes to our programs and put preventative measures in place to help our people get healthier. Really, the increase has been driven, it's not by severity, it's just been a frequency of claims filed this year. So, it's something we've just got to stay after and try to see some improvement. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ben Hartford. Ben Hartford : Adam, just I wonder you can give an update on the ongoing IT initiatives you have? Adam Satterfield : Sure, we continue to work at it. And obviously, it's a big multiyear effort. I think that we have got some little pieces and applications that have gone live and are performing well. A lot of these, the upfront work in this first couple of years was really building our new data center, getting the new boxes in place, and really setting the platform up to start converting our system. So, we are getting into the mid of this thing where more applications, the coding is done and returning them live in pilot programs. But we are certainly going slow with it. I think that it could be detrimental. And we have had competitors to put systems in whether it's a billing system or whatever to their detriment. So, we are going about in a flow in a methodical way and hopefully driving some improvement as we turn any of these applications live. Ben Hartford : Did you disclose the percent of your shipments handle through third-party brokers this quarter, if not, could you give that number? And then, any plans to meaningfully change that number over the next 12 month? Adam Satterfield : It's continues to trend at around 35% somewhere in that ballpark. And it's increased overtime. And it likely will continue to increases as more and more business continues to be handled by the third party logistic carriers. And as they're using their TMS systems and so forth and trying to add value to customer supply chain, we obviously would like to have those customer relationships direct. So, it's not anything that we are targeting, but certainly those strategic third-party logistics companies that we have good relationships with, we will continue to build on those relationships. And that can be a source of market share for us; if they're bringing freight to us, it's being handled by another carrier. If they go out and they are selling our value proposition on our behalf, then that can be an area of growth for us. Operator : We have a questions form Taylor Brown. Your line is open. Taylor Brown : Just want to go back to the LTL dynamic here. And David, I appreciate this is a bit of an odd question, but do you guys track something like a nose load percentage and are you seeing that percentage fall maybe indicating some of those bigger loads or making the way into LT. I guess at high level you've seen anything funny in that 10,000 pound market? David Congdon : Honestly, we don\u2019t track of with a nose load or head load percentage. I've never seen a number on that. Taylor Brown : Is anything they'll funny in that 10,000 pound market? David Congdon : I think that our weight per shipment is staying for the same. We saw a little bit of that in going back all of way to 2014, where we saw some you know increases in some of those really heavy weight LTL shipments that where we were handing. But right now, we look at sort of less than 10,000 pounds shipments or 10,000 and greater, and those are very few there in that greater than 10,000. Ben Hartford : Okay. David Congdon : Probably a lot of that is they can better -- it's easy to find supply. Truckload carrier that will deliver at a much lower rate from miles than what we would. Adam Satterfield : Typically when a customer has a 9,000 or 10,000 pound shipment available, they go out and shop it. And that would show up in our stock quote systems and stock loads and that kind of things. Because I think the average weight of our stock loads was 9,000 pounds last time I saw it. Ben Hartford : Then, I'm just curious of the comments about adding more service centers. So you guys are running let's call it 99% on-time, it indicates that you P&D service is already really good. So, I am curious like why would adding more service center is really help with saturation in any given market, and my guess is, adding those centers would help lower your pedal times. But would that be more of a cost benefits than a revenue driver or how should we think about that? David Congdon : It's both because especially in large markets like Atlanta, Georgia or Chicago or New York Metro even the Dallas or the Metropolis or even in Huston, yes, big market Southern California. When we first started in those markets, we had one service center. And we grew as much as we could and we had a lot of the P&D, cost was really high. We had a lot of what we call, windshield time. The drivers were having the drive out and have freight and then come back. And the cost of that was fairly high. And what we have found is that our market shares on outbound from outline markets as not as good as it is close to the service center. So, when we opened up service centers in those large markets multiple centers, we get closer to the customers and we can increase our share the outbound from those market. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I'll be happy to return the call to Mr. Earl Congdon for any conclusion remarks. Earl Congdon : As always, thank you very much for your participation. We appreciate your questions and your support of OD. And please feel free to give us a call, if you have any further questions. Thanks again and good day. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines and everyone have a great day.",

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to the company's Executive Chairman, Mr. Earl Congdon. Please go ahead, sir. Earl E. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter conference call. With me this morning are David Congdon, Old Dominion's Vice Chairman and CEO, and Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. For the fourth quarter, Old Dominion continued to produce sound financial results although our earnings per diluted share decreased by $0.02 as compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. These results reflect the impact of having one less business day than the same period of 2015. In addition, we had another quarter with higher depreciation and amortization expense along with an increase in the fringe benefit costs that were largely tied to the 25% increase in our share price during the fourth quarter of 2016. On a positive note, our revenue trends improved as the fourth quarter progressed. Net revenue per day increased by 3.2% which is the strongest growth we have seen in the last five quarters. We also returned to the year-over-year growth in LTL tons per day. After two quarters of decline, our LTL weight per shipment increased 2.5% and LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 2.6%. With momentum continuing into January, we believe Old Dominion is well-positioned to benefit from a potentially stronger economic environment in 2017. One reason is that consistent with our long-term strategy, we continued substantial investments in infrastructure and technology in 2016 while also investing in our employees by providing ongoing education and training as well as a 3% pay raise in September. Our cash flow provided by operations allowed us to make these investments while we also returned $130 million of capital to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases. To further improve shareholder return, the company announced today that our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid in the first quarter. Given the long-term strength of our financial position and our cash flow generation, we are confident in our ability to return additional capital to our shareholders even as we continue to fund significant investments in our business to leverage our near and long-term growth opportunities. Thank you for joining us this morning. And now, here is David Congdon to give you more details on the quarter. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Thanks, Earl, and good morning, everyone. Stepping back from the specific quarterly numbers for a moment, I'll begin by saying that the overall fourth quarter operating environment was similar to what we experienced through 2016. We had a slow start to the quarter, but our revenue and tonnage marginally improved on a year-over-year basis, as the quarter progressed. Our LTL tons per day essentially trended in line or slightly above normal sequential trends for November and December. This continued into January as LTL tons per day were also in line with normal seasonality. These trends, combined with the increase in LTL weight per shipment and other improving macroeconomic indicators for the fourth quarter, provided us with a sense of cautious optimism for an improved economy in 2017, which also concurs with economic forecasts or improved GDP. As I mentioned more than once in 2016, and regardless of the economic environment, we remain focused on the things that we can control by continuing to deliver superior service at a fair price while also remaining diligent with regards to cost. Our on-time delivery and cargo claim ratio each improved for the fourth quarter and the full year compared with respective periods of 2015. Providing the superior service that our customers expect can create cost inefficiencies within operations and periods when our volumes are not as strong. We operated very efficiently throughout 2016, however, as evidenced by an improvement in our variable operating costs as a percent of revenue for both the quarter and the year. I think this is a real testament to the value of our team to effectively manage productivity and costs in the face of lower volumes throughout the year. As you've heard me say before, to improve our operating margin over the long term, we need improvements in density and yield, both of which require the support of a positive economic environment. Our yield suffered a bit in 2016 with the decrease in fuel surcharges, but it remained positive in what was a generally stable albeit competitive pricing environment. The pricing environment continued to be stable in the fourth quarter, and our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 2.6% or 1.6% when excluding fuel surcharges. While this rate of growth was lower than the first three quarters of the year, the fourth quarter included a 2.5% increase in weight per shipment and a 50-basis-point decline in average length of haul. These changes generally have a negative impact on the LTL revenue per hundredweight, but as I've just mentioned, we are encouraged by the increase in LTL weight per shipment which is typically an indicator of an improving economy. We obviously didn't have the benefit of a strong economy in 2016, and the reduction in volumes didn't help with density. As a result, we were unable to leverage our fixed costs to improve our operating margin in the fourth quarter and the year. Our OR increased 30 basis points for the fourth quarter and 60 basis points for the year. Even so, we are only 40 basis points above our record fourth quarter operating ratio and 60 basis points above our best annual operating ratio performance. We remain confident that we can increase our margins in the future with improved density and yield, supported by a positive economic environment, and therefore, are encouraged by the potential for stronger growth in 2017. Thanks for joining us today. And now, Adam will review our financial results for the fourth quarter in greater detail. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Thank you, David, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue was $745.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, which was a 1.5% increase from last year. Our revenue on a per day basis increased 3.2% as the fourth quarter of 2016 had one less operating day than last year. The operating ratio was 84.8%, and earnings per diluted share were $0.83 which was a 2.4% decrease from the $0.85 of earnings per diluted share in the prior year. The increase in revenue for the fourth quarter reflects a slight increase in LTL tons per day as well as increase in yield. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 2.6% for the quarter and increased 1.6% when excluding fuel surcharges. I'll repeat what David just said and note that these metrics were impacted by changes in our mix and do not reflect any change in our pricing philosophy. LTL tons per day increased 0.3% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, as our LTL weight per shipment increased 2.5% to offset the 2.2% decrease in LTL shipments per day. On a sequential basis, our LTL tons per day in the fourth quarter decreased 2.6% as compared with the third quarter of 2016. This change was in line with our 10-year average sequential trend. For January, our revenue per day increased approximately 5% on a year-over-year basis, as we continued to see good yield performance and our LTL tons per day increased 2.2%. Our operating ratio for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 30 basis points as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. This change reflects a 60-basis-point increase in depreciation costs as a percent of revenue as well as a 50-basis-point increase in salaries, wages and benefits. The increase in salaries and benefits was primarily the result of a $7.7 million increase in our fringe benefit costs as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, as retirement plan expenses were impacted by the increase in our share price. It is important to note that a portion of the increase in both depreciation and employee-related costs resulted from our reduced reliance on purchased transportation during the year. As a result, purchased transportation costs as a percent of revenue improved 70 basis points. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $155.5 million for the fourth quarter and $565.6 million for the year. Capital expenditures were $66.8 million for the quarter and $417.9 million for 2016. The company currently expects capital expenditures for 2017 to total approximately $385 million, including planned expenditures of $185 million for real estate and service center expansion projects, $155 million for tractors and trailers, and $45 million for technology and other assets. We repurchased $11.3 million of common stock during the fourth quarter and $130.3 million for 2016. These purchases left us with $200 million available for purchase under our current $250 million repurchase program. We intend (12:45) for our share repurchase program to be our primary form of returning capital to shareholders, although repurchases in the fourth quarter were lower than previous quarters this year due to the increase in our share price. We are excited about today's announcement of the quarterly dividend, which provides us with another means to consistently return capital to shareholders, while also leaving dry powder for other investment opportunities that can drive long-term growth. Our effective tax rate was 38.5% as compared to 35.5% for the fourth quarter of 2015, which included certain discrete tax adjustments. We are hopeful for corporate tax reform in 2017; however, we currently expect our effective tax rate to be 38.6% in the first quarter of 2017. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Earl E. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Are we still on? Operator : Yes. And we'll go first to Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Appreciate it. Just going back to the \u2013 just question on basically \u2013 trying to ask about tonnage growth and \u2013 if you have a tightening environment, do you expect to see where market share essentially will go relative to your geographic expansion? I think last quarter you talked about potentially increasing up to 35 to 40 service centers. Is that the case, given maybe a little bit better macro backdrop? And then, just following up on that, in a sort of struggling economic environment, where do you expect market share to trend or where did it go in the quarter given some of the expansion and better service levels of some of the competitors? Thanks. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning. This is Adam. We still have our list of 35 to 40 service centers that we want to add to the network over time. And certainly, we continue to look and evaluate if there are opportunities to purchase land \u2013 if those opportunities present themselves, we certainly would look at taking advantage of that. From a market share standpoint, typically when periods are slower like the economic environment that we were in in 2016, and perhaps price becomes more of an issue for shippers versus looking along the spectrum towards the service side of things, then our market share gains were not as strong as they have been in better periods. So, certainly, our trends turned positive, we felt good in the third quarter. We started out a little slow. October, from a sequential standpoint, was a little bit below what our normal sequential trend is. November came back, was better than our normal sequentials. December was right in line. And January of 2017 is pretty much right in line with those normals as well. So, yeah, we'd look to get some sustained improvement in the economy, and we feel like when that happens, we certainly can get back to growing market share like we have over the longer term. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then \u2013 thanks for that. And then, on the weight per shipment trends, there were some nice sequential uptick, at least. Can you just talk about the sequential change in January \u2013 and is there anything in particular that drove that or was that kind of broad based, and you'd expect that to continue into 2017? Thanks. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Yes, the weight per shipment sort of trended about the same all year long, around 1,550 pounds, kind of plus or minus 10 pounds. We saw definitely an increase moving into November. It increased above 1,600 pounds there in November and December. So, it was a nice increase on a year-over-year and a sequential basis. It dropped a little bit in January to about 1,570 pounds, but that's pretty normal. You normally will see a little bit of, in history, your weight per shipment decline. So, we still feel good. It's been consistent. We're seeing it across the board, and like we mentioned in our comments, we feel like that that's just one more data point that we look at that's indicating that maybe we're turning the corner with the economy and can see some sustained improvement there. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And just last one on the dividend, just wanted to get an understanding on sort of the thought process there. I mean, have you been hearing from your investors that dividend would be appreciated, looking to maybe expand out the share capital base? And it's a pretty obviously nominal amount on a yield basis, would you sort of look to slowly improve that over the next quarters or so, and essentially make this more of a dividend growth story? Just trying to understand, one, the reason for the initiation of the dividend, and then how you see that evolving over time. Thank you. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we felt like that with the quality of our cash provided by operations that the strength of the balance sheet that we certainly had, the room to be able to initiate, and as we mentioned, we continue to want the share buyback program to have the priority in the terms of returning capital to shareholders. So, we have heard \u2013 and over the course of years, when we first put our buyback program in place that that shareholders would have appreciated a dividend, it's something that we evaluated back in 2014, and we've continued to evaluate it. So, we felt like we're in a good position to do so. It is a nominal amount. But as we've said that we still feel like we're a growth company and we've got plenty of dry powder to continue to invest in our business. That's where our best return on invested capital comes from. That's what we're going to continue to focus on. But this is just one of another complementary means of improving the overall shareholder return. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Good morning. This is Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thank you for taking our question. So, we were just wondering if you could clarify what the normal, I guess, historical sequential trends are for October, November and December. I know you mentioned that they were fairly in line with normal sequential trends in November and December 2016. And we're also wondering if you could share the same details for January, February and March. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Yeah. So, the normal sequential trend or weight per day, October would be down 3.5% as compared to September, November would then be up 3.2%, December would be down 9.2%. And then, in the first quarter, January would be an increase of 1.9%, February would be an increase of 1.9%, and March would be an increase of 5%. Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you. And shifting to the capital allocation, it looks like you're stepping up the capital you're putting towards real estate and technology this year, and holding back a little bit on tractor and trailer investments in 2017. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit of a color into what projects you're working on on the real estate and tech areas this year? David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: The real estate projects are \u2013 I think it was somewhere in the neighborhood of the 70 different projects that's involved expansion of service centers, we've got re-paving yards and re-roofing facilities. We've got land in there for our future building projects. It's just a wide variety of real estate projects. I think \u2013 I don't think we've given account on how many new service centers we anticipate opening but there is a handful lot in there. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: There's about four or five new facilities we think we'll open this year. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Yeah. And on the equipment side of the equation, we're \u2013 as we said, we are approaching this year cautiously optimistic. I will say that back in the fall when we first \u2013 in October, when we first did our equipment projections and our growth projections for next year, we were less optimistic about the economy. But when the election results came out, we have become more optimistic about the economy for next year. And frankly, our equipment numbers are basically a \u2013 our replacement program, and we don't have much equipment in there \u2013 there is a little bit but not much equipment in there for growth. Should we see the economy actually pick up, and as we watch our equipment and just volumes going into next year, there could be a possibility of increasing the equipment spend as we get into the year and see how things are actually trending. Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, great. Thank you for the color. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to Todd Fowler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great, thanks. Good morning. Adam, I know you probably don't want to get into giving specific items on the OR for the first quarter, but given some of the moving parts in the fourth quarter with the variable compensation, can you just help us maybe think about the basis point impact from some of those things in the fourth quarter and then what we should think about for the progression into 1Q? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I was going to give you the detail on the first quarter, but since you gave me the out, I won't - Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: One of these days, I'm going to learn just to ask the question. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: One of the biggest things that did really hurt us this whole year was the increase in our fringe benefit costs, and it fluctuated. And this past quarter, it was a little over 36% of our salaries and wages, where it had been 34% of that number for basically earlier in the year, and that started back in the fourth quarter of last year. So, I mean, that's something that we've got some opportunity on, but we don't necessarily see that there is a short-term fix or a silver bullet for that. And so, we're kind of looking at that probably continuing more in the 34% of salaries and wages range. Again, a lot of the increase that we saw just in this fourth quarter \u2013 and overall, it was a net $7.7 million increase, but a lot of that was coming from the impact of the increase in the share price on our retirement plans that are linked to that. So, obviously, we've got wage inflation in those numbers. We've still got \u2013 if you remember last year, we were still in a little bit of year-over-year growth in January and February. It was really March where we started rolling off, we had our top 10 customer. We spend a lot of time talking about last year, but we had a few large customers that rolled off the books. But we still were seeing tonnage and shipment growth in January and February. So, we've got that to deal with. But overall, I think for next year we're probably looking at cost inflation excluding the fuel of around 4%, just with some other things that we've got going on. And then, obviously, from a fuel standpoint where we are today, we're just shy of $2.60 a gallon, and I think the average in the first quarter of last year was $2.80, so we've got \u2013 definitely have a fuel cost headwind that we'll be looking at. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So, you gave me the answer, but I've got to do some work to get to the specifics, I guess. No, I appreciate the color there. And then, just my follow-up I wanted to ask, I got the comments on the January tonnage trends and the revenue per day, so \u2013 but just the thought on the revenue per hundredweight here in January, where are you seeing that trend at and how is that versus where you were in the fourth quarter? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, we don't really talk about the revenue per hundredweight on a month-to-month basis because it can \u2013 there is more impact of mix when you look at it on the month, but we still feel good about the performance of our pricing. I think that our contract renewals, those that renewed in the fourth quarter, were consistent. It was a pretty good size increase in weight per shipment, and we had the decreases only in the fall. So, on an absolute basis, our revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel, was $16.78 in the fourth quarter, and that was down a little bit sequentially from the third. But it was still above where we were in the second quarter, despite our weight per shipment being up between those two periods compared as well, so \u2013 I mean we still feel good about the environment overall. All of the reasons are still \u2013 that we felt good about the pricing environment in the industry last year are all still in place, and you've got an economy that may be improving. So, we still feel good about pricing overall for the industry, and we certainly will continue to look and execute on our pricing philosophy of trying to get an increase that will offset our own cost inflation. But yeah, from a reported yield standpoint, with an increase in weight per shipment just like we saw in the fourth quarter, it's likely that that rate of growth on a year-over-year basis could be lower than 3% to 4% true price increases that we target. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Okay. Thanks for all the thoughts this morning and the time. Nice quarter. Earl E. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Thank you. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Thank you. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to David Ross from Stifel. David Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Good morning, everyone. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Good morning. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Good morning, David. Earl E. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Hello, David. David Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Anymore optimism on twin 33s with the new administration, David? David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I think there is a decent chance that that may go through. Fred Smith is the one that's really leading the charge on the twin 33s. We've been studying our lanes and load averages and so forth, and we are honestly finding that our long-haul lanes where we could get the most bang for the buck are being loaded very, very full, and we don't have as much potential benefit from them as we once thought. So, we're leaving it up to Fred to lead the charge on that. And should the law pass, we anticipate trying to figure out the best places and ways that we could use them in our fleet. David Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then, on the CapEx side, you got about $155 million budgeted for the year with tractors and trailers, are you doing anything different on the replacement front in terms of either equipment vendors or types of equipment that you're buying? David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: The vendors are basically the same. Our freight liners are predominant vendor. We are equipping all of the trucks this year with the crash mitigation systems that have the automatic braking, we believe that that's a very good feature to put on the trucks, a worthwhile safety feature. That's probably the predominant difference in what we're doing this year. David Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Excellent. Well, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Chris Wetherbee from Citi. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, great. Thanks and good morning. I don't know if I missed it, but did you guys give the December year-over-year tonnage? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: December's year-over-year tonnage was 2.6%. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, got it. And then, when you think about the growth in January as well, it seems like a little bit of a pickup, at least on a two-year stack basis, I mean, you talked about the sequential trends and kind of how that's playing out. Generally speaking, when you're talking to customers or at least just sort of seeing activity in the market, are there certain areas where we're seeing sort of pickup is a little bit more broad based? Just want to get a rough sense on maybe how you guys are looking at freight environment, it seems like it's a touch better than it was certainly at some point in the middle of last year. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Yes. I mean, it generally feels better. There is no one particular area that's growing. We've got some that are in pockets growing faster than others, but it's pretty balanced across the system which is good and what we would want and \u2013 but no, we're just getting it sort of across the board, I guess. But we are getting positive feedback from customers. We're starting to see some pickup in some customer wins, and that's already reflected in some of the numbers. But even some of the customers that we lost some business with last year, some of that is coming back. It may not be all of it, and we may not want all of it back. But we are getting some pocket to that. So, we feel like we've got some positive momentum going with us from a revenue standpoint. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, got it. That's helpful. And when you think about the outlook for \u2013 you talked a little bit about pricing for 2017 or at least sort of the environment, and it sounds like you feel good about how things are playing out. I guess I just wanted to get a sense of sort of what you think it takes to maybe accelerate pricing. So, I think some of us might argue that 2016 probably outperformed the tonnage environment, pricing outperformed tonnage environment, was a bit sluggish on the tonnage side, but we saw decent pricing. Do you need a big step forward, you think, in tonnage to be able to see a reacceleration of pricing? I'm just trying to get a sense of maybe how you guys are approaching the market, what you need to see? David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Chris, this is David. The forecast we hear for GDP next year is like 2.5% compared to 1.6% this year, which is not a huge increase. I guess, it's close to 50% more growth than we had this year, so maybe that is a huge increase. But I think you'll see some acceleration in yield that would come with that. But perhaps the biggest potential acceleration in tonnage and yield could be with this electronic logging device mandate that's scheduled for the end of 2017. The predictions that we hear is that some time in the latter half of the year, we're likely to see some capacity come out of the truckload arena. And with the for-hire truckload market being roughly 10 times the size of the LTL market, if you had a 1% falloff in tonnage from the truckload arena, it could equate to 10% increase in the LTL arena with larger LTL shipments. And so, that could be a significant increase in our business in the latter half of the year or a surge. If we have a surge, I would expect pricing will surge along with that increase in tonnage and reduction in trucking capacity. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's really helpful. And one just very quick follow-up on that point, I think it's an interesting one. When you think about \u2013 or when you talk to customers, as we're entering sort of the early part of 2017, are they engaging with you at all in terms of conversations about contingencies for that potential implementation? I just want to get a sense of maybe if it's in the customer conversation on the LTL side yet, or maybe just something that could come later in the year. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: We're not having the \u2013 we're not hearing much about it yet. I guess I hear more about it just at conferences and different things and people speculating, and we're certainly not betting on anything in particular happening, but we'll keep our ear to the ground and stand ready to increase our truck buying, if we need to, in the latter half of the year as it comes along. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: One thing to add to that as well is that we do know that we probably lost a little business that is managed by the third-party logistics companies, with the weakness in truckload pricing, I think they were able to leverage their relationships and maybe find some trucks that were available to move, some heavier weighted shipments that otherwise would have moved through 3PL. So, if you get that general tightening, it may be rate inflection up in truckload, that certainly could be a benefit to the LTL industry. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Let me add one more thing is that we believe, and I believe very strongly personally, that we are in the best position in the LTL industry with capacity across our network because of the investments we \u2013 the continued investments we have made in our real estate over time to stay ahead of the power curve and to build out and expand our centers in the markets where our growth is the strongest and where we see the potential for future growth. So, should there be a sudden surge in the latter part of the year or first part of 2018, we are ready to handle it. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's great. Well, thanks very much for the time, guys. Very helpful. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Ben Hartford from Baird. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, good morning guys. Adam, a few balance sheet-related questions. Did you provide a debt reduction or a debt paydown target at all for 2017, and how do you think about carrying debt levels as you kind of reconsider or consider dividends as an option to return cash to shareholders plus the reduction in CapEx for 2017? Any change as to how you think about carrying debt going forward? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: We don't have any scheduled maturities with our debt in the coming years \u2013 next year, we've got one in January of 2018 that's coming due, so \u2013 and we had about $105 million of debt, there's a little bit outstanding on the revolver at the end of the year but not a lot. And frankly, that's what \u2013 our debt-to-cap was 5.4%, and that's one of the things that we were looking at as we were going into next year and making the decision on implementing the dividend. So \u2013 we feel like we've definitely got some opportunities and we can afford to put a little debt on the balance sheet, but we just want to make sure that we're prudent with our decisions and that we're doing it in the right ways and for the right reasons. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And I guess to that point, and I imagine there is more to come on that front, but if you kind of look back to where you carried debt levels during the previous cycle, it was obviously materially higher, I mean can we think about 1 times debt-to-EBITDA as a reasonable targets, without pinning it down on a specific number? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Yeah, I'd rather not say because we don't just have a stated target. Again, I think that we want to look at ways that enhance the shareholder return, and I think we've done that through the implementation of the repurchase program. We increased our repurchases in early part of 2016 and ended up buying $130 million last year on that. Now, we've added this other component, but we're still looking at ways that we can expand and grow the business. And if that's available real estate that we can take advantage of, above and beyond what's already planned, we will look at those opportunities \u2013 or other opportunities to invest and some are non-LTL business, and try to generate some growth there. But certainly, we know we've got an opportunity with the balance sheet, we just want to make sure that we're using it in a smart way. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And just to finalize that point, you had talked about expanding kind of \u2013 into complementary and potentially non-LTL businesses. Does the fact that you're introducing a dividend reduce the likelihood of \u2013 suggest that you are less inclined to do acquisitions to expand above and beyond LTL? I mean how do you think about acquisitions in the context of organic growth opportunities outside of LTL specifically? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Yeah. Our priority for allocating capital really hasn't changed. I mean it starts with reinvesting in the LTL business, that's where our best returns have been, and that's what we're going to continue to stay focused on. We continue to say that acquisitions are in second place, and granted we haven't had one since 2008, we've looked at a plenty of them and \u2013 the pricing, the valuation, whatever, just didn't make sense or just strategically we didn't think it made sense. So, we haven't executed it, and that's why we implemented the shareholder return program. But to answer your question directly, in no way is the dividend going to take away from that focus, and we're going to continue to look in \u2013 at investing first in LTL, if we can do that at a higher level this year or in the next coming years, we will. And we'll continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities as well. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And last one, if I could. The $7.7 million that you called out this quarter in fringe benefits costs that you kind of tied to incentive comp, if you will, tied to the stock price, is that all of that $7.7 million that you have or was there some other element to that fringe cost above and beyond the share price appreciation related inflation? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: That was a lot of it. It wasn't all of it, and that's something that we wanted to give as information and definitely not something that needs to be adjusted out or anything of that nature. It's just trying to disclose more information about something that changed. I guess our retirement plan expense has been \u2013 or it was kind of choppy this whole year, as there was a lot of volatility with our stock price up and down movements, and most of the annual expense came in the fourth quarter but \u2013 in the third and the fourth quarters, as we saw a good surge in our share price. And so, that \u2013 there \u2013 and you can look and we disclosed in our 10-K the number of vested shares that we have in the Phantom Stock programs and make some calculations on a dollar movement in our share price, and do sort of a back of the envelope calculation with those. But the other costs that we've seen, as mentioned I earlier, we've just had inflated group health and dental costs this entire year, and that's a trend that really is something we can manage to and something we're looking at. We're continuing to evaluate work with our partners in trying to put other wellness programs in place. Other types of preventative programs that we can try to get a good control on the health and well-being of our employees and their families. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, just a follow-up to your responses for a few questions earlier on this call, when do you \u2013 you said that you're seeing the shift from \u2013 in your customers from service to price. What gets them to focus back on service? Is it just going to be ELDs and the potential shortage on that, or do you think that the markets that have close enough to being in a balance that even an improvement in demand with seasonality should get them there? David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I think that some of it, Ravi, will come from just the general uptick in the economy. And the other part is \u2013 we've seen this time and time again through previous down cycles where customers that will leave us because a competitor offers a lower price than ours. And when they get a taste of someone else's service compared to the service levels they had in OD, they come back to us. So \u2013 and we're seeing that happen now. And we believe, as the market and capacity might tighten up going into next year and as orders are picking up and customers are trying to make their customers happy, that they will lean toward our premium service. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And just sticking with the pricing, you altered your pricing strategy a little bit last year, at least a timing of it in terms when you announce your GRI. Can you give us an update on what your experience has been with that, what's your customers' reaction been, and what can we expect for 2017 in terms of timing? David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Are you saying we altered our pricing strategy... Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: The timing of your GRI announcement. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Adam? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I mean, the only thing we did was \u2013 I mean, we pretty much announced for the most part, in line with the industry, it was on a 10-month cycle. We came out at the end of September, in 2015, it was at the end of November, but we pretty much came out in line with the rest of the group really. And I think there was only one large carrier that pretty much didn't go out in that same timeframe. But really nothing's changed in that regard, and I think that the GRI went through, there wasn't a lot of pushback because most of the other carriers were out seeking rate increases as well, which we think they need to continue to push for, if the industry is going to get healthier from a margin standpoint, to be able to support any reinvestment in capacity, and we frankly haven't seen it, on a total basis other than us, we believe that the industry has got to continue to push price up. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then, lastly, you spoke about focus on technology, can you talk about what are you hearing in terms of platooning, are you running any platooning trials out there? And do you have a potential time line for implementation? David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Ravi, we have not joined in on platooning at this point and do not have any plans to do so in the near future. But we're watching how things are transpiring on that front and the autonomous front, and so forth. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Scott Group from Wolfe. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, thanks, morning, guys. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Hi, Scott. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Adam, did you say what weight per shipment is up in January? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I didn't say what it was up but \u2013 let's see, it is about 1,570 pounds versus about 1,540 last year, give or take. I don't have the... Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. We can do that. So, I want to go back to the question on margins. So, if we think about the environment of low-single-digit tonnage and low-single-digit revenue per hundred weight net of fuel and fuel higher and some of the cost inflation, just directionally, is this an environment where we should be expecting year-over-year margin improvement? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: We always expect margin improvement, and we're always focused on it. This year, obviously, we talked about \u2013 or I mentioned earlier, some of the cost inflation, and I think in David's prepared comments, and certainly we think that the ingredients for margin improvement are certainly there. If these trends continue, if we continue to have a strengthening economy, that will be supportive of a positive yield environment and certainly we think that we're already seeing year-over-year tonnage growth. And as I mentioned, those numbers can look a little bit better once we get through March. So, certainly, we've got a density opportunity and we've got the yield opportunity that's in front of us, we just need the economy to really continue to be sustained. I mean, as we went through last year, we'd see a couple of good months, and then you take a step back and it just felt really rocky and sort of bumping along the bottom. So, I think IFCL number that was released yesterday is one of the strongest numbers in a couple of years. There is a lot of things that we feel like are turning, but I can tell you, we're certainly focused on managing our costs, managing productivity. And all of these things are certainly looking better than they looked when we entered 2016. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Another thing is that our fixed cost structure this year includes a lot of investments we've made in IT and also our human resources functions. And those costs should be relatively level going into 2017 and beyond, and as the growth improves a little bit, we should be able to get some leverage against those fixed costs. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Maybe I'll try and ask it a little bit differently. Is there historically a tonnage level that you think you need to see to see margin improvement? And then, when I just think about the mix of weight per shipment going higher and revenue per hundredweight net of fuel, a little less, does that generally help or hurt incremental margin? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: If you look at revenue per shipment, certainly this year, that can be higher and \u2013 I mean that's \u2013 if you look at our revenue per shipment and then compare that with what our costs per shipment and how those are trending, that's the more relevant comparison, I guess. But there's so many variables that go into it, Scott, it depends. And we get asked that question a lot of what tonnage do you need, it depends on what other actions are we taking. I think that that we've had margin improvement in periods with lower tonnage and with higher tonnage, but what level of CapEx do we have? I mean, there are so many other variables that go into it that it's hard to say what's the specific number of tonnage growth we need because you'd have to have that wide variable of what's the yield increase offsetting. Obviously, we'd like to have more yield, that increasing versus the volume. We always use to say that a 1% change in yield or decrease, you would need 5% to 6% increase in tons to offset. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then, just lastly, I think you guys in the past have talked about your goal is to grow tonnage 500 or 600 or 700 basis points faster than the market. Is that still your goal? Is that still a realistic goal once the environment gets a little bit better? David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: It's a little bit harder to get that much tonnage \u2013 I mean that much spread on our growth rate today than it used to be back when we were expanding geography and also when we look back at some of the disruption in the marketplace with the fallout of business from YRC, and we touched on that I think last fall in a conference call. But \u2013 and then, also when the market is soft and the freight environment is soft, our spread in tonnage growth has gotten down to \u2013 and if you take aside one of the carriers who was using price to get tonnage recently or this past year, our spread in growth is down in the 200 to 300 basis point maybe difference between the rest of us and the rest of the LTL industry. Yeah, so, as we \u2013 as the environment is changing and the overall economy is getting a little bit better, maybe 300 to 500 sounds \u2013 is maybe more realistic than 500 to 700 bps of difference. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. I appreciate the time, guys. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to Ari Rosa from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ariel Luis Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning, guys. So, wanted to touch on the competitive landscape, just \u2013 I was hoping you could talk about how competitors may be expanding their geographic footprint has impacted your business, if at all, and what competitors are doing broadly on kind of the pricing front and what you're seeing out there? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I think that on the pricing front, we continue to feel like it's been stable. No signs of increasing competitiveness or anything along that front, and I would say too that we mentioned we're getting some business back from \u2013 that we lost last year. Generally, when we lose business, it's on price. And I think some of that freight is being re-bid. So, some of the carriers that maybe took it at a little bit cheaper price last year figured out it did not operate as well and they're trying to push prices up a little bit more, and that may be contributing again to some of our marginal improvement. But it takes service pricing capacity to grow. And as David mentioned before, we feel like we're definitely in the best shape in the industry in terms of service. We continue to have award-winning service, 99% on time and a low claims ratio each year. We certainly got the capacity in the network, and price is now becoming maybe more normalized. And so, we certainly think that if price is not a factor, that we're going to win on service and capacity. So, we feel good or feel really good from that standpoint. Ariel Luis Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, just switching a bit to the spend and (54:57) capital allocation, you mentioned that the decision to start paying a dividend was a little bit driven by the fact that the share price had risen so much. I mean, I was hoping you could provide a little bit of visibility into what the criteria is that you're using internally as you look at the share price and as you decide what ideal reasonable level to buy back shares and then be allocated (55:19) to shareholder returns, and why you may have decided that this quarter wasn't such a good time? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I got you, you're breaking up a little bit, Ari, so I'm going to answer what I think you asked, but yeah, we did... Ariel Luis Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Sorry about that. I can ask it again. I don't know if you heard, I was saying just what the level is \u2013 what the criteria is that you're using to decide when's a good time for share buybacks, and what's behind the decision to pay dividends instead of increasing the buyback? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I got you. So, we have a grid and we don't disclose the details of that, for which, buying our shares, and obviously we want to buy when the price is lower. And I think when you look at the average price, as we put this program in place, we bought shares at about an average price of $65, and that doesn't mean that that's our ceiling. We certainly have bought when the price is higher, but we continue to execute on that grid. We changed it a little bit at the beginning of 2016. And if you go back into 2015, we had not bought more than $35 million in a quarter, and we stepped that up in the first half of 2016 when our share price was lower and bought about $90 million in the first half of the year. So as the price increased, we've started buying fewer shares, that's the way our grid is designed. And we've been out of the market of late, and we'll continue to evaluate the change in landscape and perhaps make changes to our grid this year, but we would rather buy it when the price is cheaper. That didn't impact \u2013 the decision on the dividend is not to replace, but anything with the buybacks, and as I mentioned, we continue to think that the buyback is a better form of returning capital, and that's our intention and that would be the primary means of doing so. But the dividend \u2013 just \u2013 is one complementary means of returning capital that's consistent, and that was some of the decision-making in adding that cash dividend. Ariel Luis Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. That makes sense. And then, (57:43) about deregulation, I was hoping you guys could talk on what you think the impact of that might be across the industry, and if there are any regulations in particular that you guys are targeting as going away and what impact that might have on your cost structure? David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: You broke up a lot, and I think you were asking about that regulatory reform that's... Ariel Luis Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Exactly. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I don't think any of us know exactly what that regulatory reform might look like. I know one thing in particular that there was a proposed rule-making last year for speed limiter devices, you know for the trucking industry, and that is highly, highly contested by different parties within the American Trucking Association, it was \u2013 and we like to see that thing rolled back right now. Most all of the fleets out there today have speed limiting devices already on our fleets, but due to the wide variance in speed limits across the nation, there is no perfect speed that could be uniformly applied across the United States. And so, that's one that needs some attention. But other regulatory reform, who knows what's going to come down the pipe. Ariel Luis Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Okay, great. And then, just one real quick housekeeping, could you just give the number of working days by quarter in 2017, and also just say the number again of what LTL tonnage per day was up in January? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Sure. The tons per day in January was up 2.2% on year-over-year basis, and mostly workdays \u2013 let me get to it, by quarter for 2017, it's 64 in the first quarter, 64 in the second quarter, 63 in the third quarter and 62 in the fourth quarter. Ariel Luis Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Matt Brooklier from Longbow Research. Matt S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Is 3% to 4% price growth, is that still a good bogey to think about for this year? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Well, as I mentioned before, that's what we target with our contractual renewals, and our pricing philosophy is \u2013 that we look at our own cost inflation and that's what we ask for in the form of a price increase to offset. Now, from a revenue per hundredweight standpoint, that yield metric, as it was in the fourth quarter, is likely to be lower than 3% to 4% because of mix changes. And when you got an increase in weight per shipment like we had in the fourth quarter, that certainly going to put a \u2013 have a negative effect on that reported metric. It doesn't mean that underlying core pricing is weaker at all or in any way. So, we still feel good about being able to get those sort of 3% to 4% targeted increases next year or this year. Matt S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And then, can you just remind us when the weight per shipment comps, when those get easier this year? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Easier in terms of like when it will comp with where we were in the fourth quarter? Matt S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah, when do we lap \u2013 I mean I can look back in my model, but when do we lap the increases in weight per shipment that we saw last year, the beginning of that? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Yes. So, well, it trended again sort of ballpark about 1,550 pounds in each of the first three quarters. So, we've been closer to 1,600 pounds in the fourth quarter. So, if \u2013 depending on if we stay at around 1,600 in the first three quarters of the year making that assumption, then obviously we'd have an increase there and an impact on \u2013 that impact on yield for those first three quarters. Matt S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And then, just a question on head count, I think head count was down in fourth quarter. You guys did a good job of managing head count into kind of a less robust growth environment. Now that tonnage is picking up, how should we think about head count going into first quarter? I think traditionally head count has grown sequentially, but are you at a point, with where tonnage starting to pick up again here, meeting that heads in first quarter? And then, maybe just some color on the progression of potential head count growth through the rest of the year. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Yeah, I think we're in pretty good shape with the workforce, where we are and the volumes we have. Certainly, at the local level, it's up to each terminal manager to make decisions on what their volumes are and what their head count needs should be. We always \u2013 to protect service, we like to add our employees before the volumes are picking up because we want to make sure that they've had suitable time to train and to be able to protect our own service. So, certainly, if we continue to see volumes picking up, there could be an increase in head count for that reason. Matt S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC : Okay, but you're not getting pinched right now, just given the fact we're kind of in the initial stages of tonnage reaccelerating potentially? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: No. I think we're in pretty good shape, and our head count overall was down slightly in December compared to September, which a lot of times could be normal. But I think the shape across the network with where we are today, but certainly we're finally starting to see some year-over-year growth. And we'll continue to be mindful of what those labor needs should be in each particular area. Matt S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And then, last question, where did the service center count end the year? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: It was 254. Pardon me, I am sorry... David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: 226. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Wrong number. Matt S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC : 225, you're already \u2013 it's a couple years out there, Adam. Okay. Thank you for the time. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Yes, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to David Campbell from Thompson Davis & Company. David Pearce Campbell - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Yes, thank you very much. My questions have been answered. I think you may report it in your press release that you haven't seen a number of employees at the end of the year. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Yes, the number of employees, the actual number at the end of the year was 17,543 full-time employees. David Pearce Campbell - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Well, thank you very much. All my other questions have been answered. Thank you. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: All right. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Thank you, David. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue at this time. Unverified Participant : Okay. As always, thank you, all, for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and support of Old Dominion. Please feel free to give us a call if you have any further questions. Thanks and good day. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to the Company\u2019s President and Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir. Greg Gantt : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. I\u2019m here today with Adam Satterfield, our Chief Financial Officer. David Congdon could not be here today, and they asked me to step in. I\u2019ve met many of you previously at conferences or here in our office, and I look forward to meeting more of you in the future. But for now, let\u2019s get started on our call, and after some brief remarks we\u2019ll be glad to take your questions. We\u2019re off to a good start in 2017 and produced our best financial results in terms of year-over-year growth in revenue and earnings per share versus the second quarter of 2015. We believe this is a welcome sign of an improving economy and are pleased that momentum with our revenue has continued to date in April. As we said in our fourth quarter conference call, we believe Old Dominion is well-positioned to benefit from a stronger economic environment. We have the capacity to absorb an increase in demand for our superior service which is consistently delivered by a team of employees that are dedicated to exceeding our customer\u2019s expectation. In the first quarter, we delivered 99% on time, and produced another company record for our cargo claims ratio at 0.2%. Looking ahead, we remain cautiously optimistic about the economy, and will continue to be prudent with our approach to managing labor and equipment capacity. Regardless of how the operating environment unfolds, however, we are confident that by consistently providing our customers with superior service at a fair price, we can extend our long-term record of consistently gaining market share. We believe an increase in market share adds network density, which combined with an improvement in yield can allow us to earn an appropriate return to support our business model and growth strategy. Our long-term growth strategy includes continued investments in additional service centers and equipment capacity as well as our technology infrastructure, while also providing consistent training and education for our OD family of employees. Having refined our business model for the past 2 decades, we are stronger and more capable of executing on our strategies than ever before. We believe that customer demand for the basic value proposition that we provide at all times, claim-free service at a fair price will continue to grow over the long-term. We\u2019re confident in our ability to continue meeting this demand in the years ahead, which we expect to drive long-term growth and earnings and shareholder value. Thanks for your time this morning, and now Adam will discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion\u2019s revenue increased 6.6% in the first quarter of 2017, to $754.1 million. We had a 20-basis point improvement in our operating ratio and as a result, our earnings per diluted share increased 11.1% at $0.80 per share. The increase in revenue for the first quarter reflects an increase in both yield and LTL tons per day. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 4.9% and increased 2.4% when excluding fuel surcharges. Our yield metrics were impacted by both the increase in LTL weight per shipment and decrease in length of haul, which generally puts downward pressure on our revenue per hundredweight. LTL tons per day increased 2.4% as compared to the first quarter of 2016. With LTL shipments per day increasing 1.4% and LTL weight per shipment increasing 1%. On a sequential basis, our LTL tons per day in the first quarter decreased 1.3% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. This change was slightly worse than our 10-year average sequential trend, which is a decrease of 0.8%. Although the quarterly average was below our long-term trend, our volumes accelerated as we finished March, and have trended favorably into April as well. For April, our LTL tons per day have increased approximately 4% on a year-over-year basis and our yield continues to trend favorably. Our first quarter operating ratio improved 20 basis points to 85.7% as compared to the first quarter of 2016. This was the first improvement in our quarterly operating ratio since the third quarter of 2015, and occurred despite the 40-basis point increase in depreciation cost as a percent of revenue. Our operating ratio benefited from a 30-basis point improvement in insurance and claims expenses as a percent of revenue as well as improvement in our variable operating cost. The operating ratio also benefited from the increase in revenue, which helped create leverage on certain fixed costs. As we enter the second quarter of 2017, we anticipate a higher rate of cost inflation due to planned increases in spending. Among other things, these additional expenditures will include cost related to our strategic vision to become the official freight carrier of Major League Baseball, which we expect to generate opportunities for increased brand recognition and market share growth. Old Dominion\u2019s cash flow from operations totaled $110.8 million for the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $57 million, and we continue to expect total capital expenditures of approximately $385 million for the year. We returned $8.3 million of capital to our shareholders during the first quarter, which included $8.2 million in the form of a cash dividend, our first ever dividend payment. The average closing price of our common stock at $88.74 during the first quarter, we only repurchased $50,000 of our common stock. These purchases left us with approximately $200 million available for purchase under our current $250 million stock repurchase program. Intend for our share repurchase program to be the primary form of returning capital to shareholders over the long-term, although, there may be periods when our repurchases are limited. With an average share price in the lower 80s, to start the second quarter, we have repurchased $2.6 million of shares so far in April. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 38.6% as compared to 38.4% for the first quarter of 2016. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be 38.6% in the second quarter of 2017. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we\u2019ll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Brad Delco from Stephens. Brad Delco : Yes. Good morning, Greg. Good morning, Adam. How are you? Greg Gantt : Hi, Brad. Adam Satterfield : Brad. Brad Delco : Greg or Adam, could you talk about what you think the drivers were or what geographies are seeing strength with your comments about acceleration in late March and into April? And then Adam, could you give March tonnage, and that April tonnage number you gave of plus 4, is that adjusted for Easter or is that with the tougher comp? Adam Satterfield : That\u2019s just what the number is today, not the actual comp. Brad Delco : Okay, thanks. And then in terms of just the general, where you\u2019re seeing the strength and what you think really drove this late quarter acceleration into April? Greg Gantt : Brad, we\u2019re fairly consistent across our network. Obviously, there are some better than others but it\u2019s fairly consistent. We may have one here there that needs some support and there\u2019s reasons for that but our sales folks are on top of it. But for the most part, it was fairly consistent across the network. Adam Satterfield : The other part of your question, Brad, the March volumes, on a sequential basis, March was up 5.6% over February. Our 10-year average is plus 5% and when you think back in the middle of March, we had some weather issues in the Northeast, but we just really finished that month out really strong. In April, the normal increase is 0.5% above March and at this point, we are churning pretty much in line with that normal trend, maybe even slightly above despite the \u2013 how well we performed in March. Brad Delco : And would that be unusual considering you probably had what, a half day on Good Friday? Adam Satterfield : I mean that Good Friday is baked in to those long-term trends but you\u2019re right. Good Friday always is impacted pretty significantly. Good Friday, as you know, was in March of last year. But nevertheless, that\u2019s what the trend is right now. Brad Delco : Okay, great. I\u2019ll leave with that question and get back in queue. Thanks. Operator : And we will take our next question from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. Brian Konigsberg : Yes. Hi, good morning. Greg Gantt : Good morning, Brian. Adam Satterfield : Good morning, Brian. Brian Konigsberg : Hey, just wanted to touch on the revenue per hundredweight. I think, good result again in the quarter. I think you noted like the haul was down and you kind of performed despite that. Maybe just talk about what you see as far as trend in the remainder of the year, and how we should be thinking about pricing as the year progresses. Adam Satterfield : I mean we think the pricing environment continues to be stable. We haven\u2019t seen a lot of competitiveness. You always see some spotty pricing issues but it just \u2013 it feels a little bit better. But I think we\u2019d still characterize it as stable. I think that we had good performance in the first quarter. There\u2019s no exact algorithm to normalize for changes in mix with the weight per shipment increasing and length of haul decreasing. But when you just look at the absolute revenue per hundredweight, with and without fuel, they were both higher than where we were in the fourth quarter. Regarding our weight per shipment, if you just look sequentially, it decreased from the first quarter into the first, but even going back to last year, and say, the third quarter, when weight per shipment was more in line with that quarter, I still think our absolute level is right in line or slightly better. So we will continue to target as we\u2019ve always said, 3% to 4% increase to price increase with our contractual accounts as they renew. And then when we evaluate new business and we brought on a fair amount of new business in the first quarter, we go through our normal costing and pricing process and look to ensure that each account spends on its own from a profitability standpoint and that we earn a return that\u2019s necessary to allow us to be able to reinvest in the business and execute on our strategic plan. Brian Konigsberg : Great, that\u2019s helpful. If I could just have a follow-on. Just kind of thoughts on the ability to add terminals this year. I know you were planning to add, my number is, 4 to 5, I believe. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong on that one. But how is that shaping up as far as you see it today? And any visibility as far as the cadence over the next several years like 35 to 40 you\u2019re targeting over the longer-term? Greg Gantt : We are on target with what we had planned for this year. I think you probably know we are adding in some of the major markets. We\u2019ve got one underway in Houston, 1 in Dallas, Chicago, suburbs of those, but we\u2019re well \u2013 those are well underway. But we\u2019ll see how it goes. It\u2019s difficult now to add real estates. It\u2019s hard to find land, there\u2019s not very many existing structures available like there were 10, 15 years ago. So it\u2019s difficult, but we will add as we see the need, and as we have opportunities. We\u2019re always opportunistic if we can be. But it\u2019s well underway. And I\u2019m not sure about that 35 to 40 number. But we\u2019ll see how that goes. But we are adding as we see the need. Brian Konigsberg : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Chris Wetherbee : Great, thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to touch on the yield dynamic in the month of March. Just want to make sure I understood, sort of how that was playing out, I think your quarter-to-date, your February was almost 100 basis points or so lower than what you ultimately finished out for the year, so just \u2013 was there \u2013 was it the new customers coming off of the network that got sort of that revenue per hundredweight boost. Just want to understand that a little bit better if we could. Adam Satterfield : Yes. Some of it, we know, I talk often about. It\u2019s hard to just look at yield on a 1-month basis and certain mix changes can have more of a pronounced impact. If you look back into last year, going from February of 2016 into March of 2016 our weight per shipment decreased in those months, and so the absolute level revenue per hundredweight was a little bit lower in March. And so it made the month comparison a little bit easier, if you will, and so then that obviously brought up the quarter. But we \u2013 like I\u2019ve said, and we continue to say, we still, we always target earning the appropriate amount of revenue per hundredweight, if you will, and it\u2019s really that\u2019s not how we price, but we just look at all the business that comes to us. And we had a lot of the growth that we had in the first quarter came from existing accounts and some of our 3PL accounts that were bringing new business to us. So that is going to have an underlying impact on mix. But we feel good about our performance with pricing. And what we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re going to continue to target those same types of increases that we always have to ensure that we\u2019re offsetting our own cost inflation. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the color. And then just wanted to circle back on your comment around the cost side and specifically, I think the baseball contract. How should we think about that and maybe how that plays relative to your typical sort of strong incremental margins in a growing volume environment? Just wanted to get a sense if you could help us quantify some of those dynamics that would be great. Adam Satterfield : Yes. I don\u2019t want to give specifics on the numbers. But obviously, we\u2019ll probably see increases in our general supplies and expenses, and our miscellaneous expense line items as well in the income statement. But on the last call, we talked about cost inflation for the year, and we generally say 3% to 4%, and I mentioned at that point that we anticipated cost inflation more in line of 4% per shipment this year because we had some planned increases in spending that we were evaluating basically and we\u2019ve got the 3% wage increase that\u2019s driving most of our cost. But now we\u2019ll have a little increase from a sequential standpoint in the second quarter in those miscellaneous \u2013 the general supplies and expenses and miscellaneous expenses. So that would take us up of that 4% level kind of for the year. But yes, some of that, and frankly as we get more volume growth and we talked about this, it\u2019s creating leverage on our overhead cost. And so obviously, we would like to see continued increase in shipment counts and that could help offset that cost inflation as well as we had good productivity in our operations in the first quarter, and we had improvements in our line haul productivity. We had improvements in our P&D. Our dock was flat. But if you recall last year, we had a really good productivity improvements in our docks. So that continues to be very efficient productive operation. And so those obviously will all go into to help in our cost. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That\u2019s helpful color. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Greg Gantt : Thanks, Chris. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Seldon Clarke : This is Seldon Clarke, on for Amit. Adam Satterfield : Hi. Seldon Clarke : Can you talk a little bit about your headcount growth in the quarter? And why we saw that come down while shipments were up last quarter? And do you still expect us to grow in line with shipments over the longer-term? Adam Satterfield : Oh, it never grows exactly in line. And we obviously, a lot of times, you\u2019ll see changes in our headcount in a growth environment increasing prior to the growth in shipments, but I think that we just continue the \u2013 it was \u2013 headcount was just down slightly really from the fourth quarter, March compared to December, but it\u2019s just an ongoing evaluation of where we have people, and where we make changes and some of that could \u2013 it can be just spread across the country based on volumes in any particular location or even here in the offices. But anyways, typically, our headcount increases are generally ahead of growth in shipments because we like to get our people in and get them trained on our systems, and how we handle business so that we don\u2019t have any letdown in service, knowing that service really has been the key driver to our long-term growth in market shipment. Seldon Clarke : Okay. Yes, that kind of, is the reason why I thought headcount would be up in Q1. You typically don\u2019t expect it to go the other direction. And then I guess, next, are you seeing any sort of shift in mix giving the ongoing changes in retail and e-commerce? And do you think that\u2019s part of the driving force kind of behind the decline in weight per shipment and shorter length of haul? Adam Satterfield : Yes, retail for us is about 25% of our revenue. We did have some growth with some of our retail accounts in the first quarter. I mentioned we had some growth in our 3PL maintenance business as well, whether or not that\u2019s kind of 3PL or retail-related or industrial. It\u2019s sort of under the covers of all the accounts they bring to us. But long-term, I think that you\u2019ll see the industry continue to benefit from e-commerce trends and it just depends on where you are on the supply chain. For us, we\u2019re not doing the final mile delivery to home. We\u2019ve got some residential delivery, it\u2019s less than 2% of our deliveries, but most of our freights going to be further up supply chain going into distribution centers or fulfillment centers. Seldon Clarke : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks, guys. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jason Seidl with Cowen. Jason Seidl : Thank you, Adam and Greg. Hope you guys are well this morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about, sort of, the mix of business and how it might relate to a potential tightening in the truckload capacity as we go throughout the year and moving to 2018. Is this something that we should expect? Is this something that Old Dominion expects to happen? Granted it would be more of a late impact for this year versus the rest of the quarters. Greg Gantt : Jason, we\u2019re expecting that. We will just have to wait and see. We keep hearing anecdotally of some small carriers fall away already. So don\u2019t know that we can count for a whole lot at this point but we are expecting that later in the year. We\u2019ll see where it goes but definitely have that on the radar. Jason Seidl : And you guys think this will help actually improve the pricing dynamics, which have admittedly been very, very solid for the LTL sector? Greg Gantt : Yes. Jason Seidl : Okay. On the Major League Baseball contract... Greg Gantt : If it tightens like we expect it or like it could, it would have an effect on the price. Jason Seidl : Now, the contract for Major League Baseball that you called out, you didn\u2019t obviously get into some specifics on exactly how much it was adding. But could you talk a little bit about, is it just going to be a one-quarter cost? Or is this something that\u2019s going to impact 2017 in terms of just upfront cost? Adam Satterfield : It\u2019s more so over the second and third quarters. If you think about the baseball season, that\u2019s where we\u2019ll be spending the money during that season. So the first quarter didn\u2019t have those costs in it really and there may be some in kind of the beginning of the fourth quarter but the majority of it will be in the second and third. Jason Seidl : In the second, third. I\u2019m assuming you guys in the second quarter right now are going to take all the bats out of Shea Stadium because apparently my team is not using them right now. All right. Gentlemen, that\u2019s all I have. I appreciate the times always. Greg Gantt : You bet. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just sort of a bigger picture question. I mean this debate on soft data versus hard data there when it comes to broader economy. Given what you\u2019re seeing on the ground and the trends in March and April, are you kind of feeling confident that, that soft data strength is translating into a hard data pickup as well or do you think it\u2019s too early to tell for the rest of the year, I mean? Adam Satterfield : We\u2019ve talked about this before where we started seeing the pickup in ISM and industrial activity. And we started seeing that in our volumes going back into the fourth quarter we\u2019re all trending favorably and then we took a little bit of step back in February where we were under normal sequentials and February, that was a bit of an odd month with only 20 work days, and we had some weather in it and just the way the days fell. Certainly, the pickup in March and then the way March finished, and then the acceleration again into April, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about that. But as Greg mentioned, we continue to be more cautiously optimistic because we want to just make sure that we really see, not only the same momentum with the economy but also in freight volumes and so we continue to stay on top of it and managing capacity both from a people standpoint and an equipment standpoint. Certainly, we\u2019ve gone through this many times before and we will make sure that we have the people in place, be it our drivers and those working on our docks to be able to handle our customers\u2019 freight and pick up in their business and so forth. But it seems like now some of our numbers are coming in line with these macro industrial numbers, 60% of our business is industrial-related. So those now are going hand-in-hand, and it\u2019s kind of reconciling with feedback that we\u2019ve received from our customers and from our salesforce in the field as well that have been indicating for some time that our customers seem a little bit more optimistic about the pace of the economy and maybe the direction that we\u2019re headed. Ravi Shanker : Great. And just one maintenance follow-up. Did you give us the trends for weight per shipment and revenue per hundredweight in April so far? Adam Satterfield : Yes. The tonnage, I didn\u2019t give weight per shipment. I just indicated that tons are up about 4% to date through April. And that, yield, yield continues to perform well and pretty much in line with the performance that we\u2019ve seen in first quarter. Ravi Shanker : Okay, got it. Thank you for the follow-up. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison Landry : Good morning, and thank you. Just a quick clarification on your last comment. The April tons down or I guess up about 1%. Was that a sequential reference? Adam Satterfield : I said 1%. I meant to say 4%, we\u2019re up. Tons on a year-over-year basis, the tons in April were up about approximately 4%. Allison Landry : Okay. Year-over-year? Okay. Adam Satterfield : Right. The normal sequential, I think I gave this earlier. The normal sequential increase in April from March is a plus 0.5% and we\u2019re right in line with that, just slightly above it, is kind of how we\u2019re trending right now. Allison Landry : Okay, perfect. Thank you for the clarification on that. So thinking about the incremental margins, right around 19%. With the uptick in pricing and tonnage, could you talk a little bit about maybe why you didn\u2019t see little bit stronger contribution margins? Adam Satterfield : I\u2019ll say we felt pretty good with the 19% after the year we just went through. Allison Landry : Sure. Absolutely. Adam Satterfield : So getting back to that point and actually having some overall improvement feels good to us, and a lot of that just comes from the top line, but the normal sequential change in our operating ratio from the fourth quarter into the first is about 100-basis point deterioration. That\u2019s pretty much where we were, it\u2019s really about 130 basis points. So we did a little bit better from a normal sequential standpoint, but the reality is, while we feel better the revenue is up 6%, and we\u2019ve still got a lot of cost in the business, and we added a lot of CapEx last year, and the depreciation continues to be a headwind for us from an OR standpoint, and that may moderate a little bit. We\u2019ve talked about it, we just got to grow into some of the investments that we made last year. So we still got a little bit of growth anyway. Allison Landry : Sure. Okay. That actually \u2013 that makes a lot of sense and understood on the sequential change in the OR and certainly on finally getting to a point where you\u2019re seeing the year-over-year margin improvement. And just in terms of, just a last question here. I guess, it was back in September of 2015, you held an Analyst Day, and highlighted for us several of the different technology initiatives that are underway and \u2013 just wondering if you can provide us with an update on where that stands? And I think, one of the bigger projects or perhaps the biggest project, Operation Delta, but the progress is tracking like there. And then, is there a way to frame the productivity benefits that you\u2019ve realized so far? And how we should think about that going forward? And hopefully, within the context of an improving freight environment? Adam Satterfield : We did talk about that at the Analyst Day and the reality is we\u2019ve put a lot into it, it\u2019s reflected in our numbers. We\u2019ve done a lot of hiring. We\u2019re just finishing up kind of the first phase of some of what we\u2019ve done, and a lot of it was really just getting the infrastructure right, and some of the different data center build outs and boxes put in place. But we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s probably taking longer than what we initially anticipated to go through this conversion product of change in our code, and the most important thing we didn\u2019t want to do is impact our current systems, the technology that we\u2019re providing to our customers delivering every day. And so we\u2019ve continued to program in the old environment to meet customer needs and we felt like that was important. So it\u2019s kind of adding to this overall modernization initiatives. So with that said, we\u2019re just kind of finishing this first phase on it. Honestly, we\u2019re going through an evaluation right now of what\u2019s going right, what hasn\u2019t gone as well as we would have liked and trying to reassess kind of where we are and how we think we\u2019re going to get this total project accomplished. But again, the most important thing was making sure that our systems, and I think from a technology standpoint, if you visited our docks, we\u2019ve got a high utilization of systems in place for managing our freight, and we want to make sure that nothing impacts that overall and obviously, in an optimal best case scenario and what the intention of the project was, was not only getting to this new environment but as you mentioned, would be generating some operating efficiencies and so forth. So we\u2019re not there yet but \u2013 certainly we hope to be. Allison Landry : Okay, thank you so much for the clarification. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Ross with Stifel. David Ross : Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Greg Gantt : Good morning, David. David Ross : Can you talk about your average fleet age, right now on the tractor side. What your targets are? And then any maintenance issues you\u2019re having? Adam Satterfield : The average fleet age at the end of last year was about 4.5 years and that was a slight improvement from where we were the year prior, those are all the investments that we made last year that continue to bring it down. But we\u2019re continuing to see the maintenance cost or maintenance per mile as trending favorably as we bring in new equipment into the network and generally those costs are from a maintenance standpoint are better. And if you think about kind of where we are in the lifecycle and you know the way we use equipment for kind of 10, 12 years for our tractor, we\u2019re getting to the point where we\u2019re cycling through, if you think about 10 years ago, was when we went through a major engine change. So some of those units we have had some maintenance reliability issues with and maintenance cost increasing. So a lot of that $155 million of CapEx this year on equipment, we might could have got by with a little bit more. But we felt like it was the right thing to do to go ahead and cycle out and maybe more of those older pre-\u201907 type engines that we had in the fleet. David Ross : And you guys do all the maintenance in-house? Or the majority of it? Adam Satterfield : Yes. We do most of it in-house with the shop locations that we\u2019ve got spread throughout the country but there are certain places where we\u2019ve got to outsource that. David Ross : Are you seeing any issues with recruiting technicians? Greg Gantt : It\u2019s difficult in some places, David. But you just have to work harder at it but it is difficult in some places. David Ross : Better or worse than the driver situation? Greg Gantt : Place to place, it varies. It just depends. But we\u2019re doing fine. David Ross : Excellent. Thank you very much. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Fowler : Great, thanks. Good morning. Adam, to your earlier comments about growing into investments that you made last year, how do you think about the sort of number of quarters or tonnage growth right now than you could sustain and keep the leverage on a depreciation line before you\u2019d have to maybe making sizable investments again? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of, I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s a question about excess capacity but it\u2019s probably more of a question about it feels like you\u2019ve got some leverage in the model now based on the investment last year and if you continue to see this sort of tonnage growth, can you sustain that leverage? Adam Satterfield : I still look at it as we\u2019re making sizable investments this year with a $385 million CapEx and $155 million on the equipment side. But where we were in the first quarter, just to get depreciation back to just a flat basis, would require double-digit growth in revenue. Going into the second quarter, and kind of the back half of the year I think we\u2019ve got an opportunity for that depreciation line to start normalizing if we can continue to see a strong revenue growth, I think, in the second quarter than where we are, a similar type of thing would take about 10% or so for our depreciation to kind of normalize at 6.2% last year in the second quarter. And to get to where we are, the good thing about this year, last year if you recall it was not a necessity but we accelerated the delivery cycle of our equipment and so we started having depreciation hitting the books a little bit sooner than normal. This year, we\u2019re really just starting to take delivery in April on the equipment side. So we\u2019re back to more of a normalized cycle and maybe taken a little bit of heat off of the sequential change in depreciation. Todd Fowler : Is the thought process that you can get depreciation back down to 100 basis points lower than where it is right now as a percent of revenue? I think that\u2019s where it\u2019s been, maybe going back 3 or 4 years ago. Adam Satterfield : Todd, I don\u2019t think that we will get back to that level. A main reason why is think about some of the operational changes that we\u2019ve made with purchased transportation. And so there\u2019s an element in that transportation that was spent for equipment for those owner-operators or truckload substitution that we were using. So there\u2019s an element of that, that now will be in our depreciation line. Whether that\u2019s just again in our line haul operations and we\u2019re pretty much 100% using our own people and our own equipment for line haul and then in our container drayage operation where we had previously used owner-operators and today we\u2019re running that model, we\u2019re using employees and our own equipment as well. Todd Fowler : That\u2019s a helpful reminder, thanks, Adam. And just for my follow-up, weight per shipment has been pretty stable. Really going back through the better part of last year. Is this where weight per shipment is going to settle out kind of in a new environment or would you expect it to drift back up if the economy picks up particularly in some of the heavier weighted industrial-type shipments? Adam Satterfield : I would like to see it increase. That was the other element that gave us some confidence in the fourth quarter on our weight per shipment. It has been trending around 1,550 pounds and it went up to 1,600 pounds in the fourth quarter, and now we\u2019ve kind of trended back down a little bit, and I don\u2019t think that, that is related to the economy. Generally, you would think rising weight per shipment is better economy, when I look through, and I\u2019ve said this a couple of times now but some of the changes follow up sequentially in weight per shipment. Many of those are coming from customers, particularly 3PLs that we had some pretty good growth with. And so I think it\u2019s just new business that\u2019s been brought into it. So it\u2019s not necessarily an existing customer that got fewer widgets on each shipment. It\u2019s just we\u2019re getting a different mix of customers within that 3PL maintenance business. Todd Fowler : Okay. That makes sense. And then, of course, I think that there was \u2013 it\u2019s pretty well documented some available truckload capacity here in the first quarter as well. So, okay, thanks for the time this morning. I appreciate it. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. So just a follow-up on weight per shipment. Adam, can you give us the monthly sequential change in weight per shipment? And then anything you can tell us about weight per shipment sequentially so far in April? Adam Satterfield : Yes. The weight per shipment, it had decreased from where we were in December, decreased down about 1,570 pounds in January and then 1,557 and 1,559 in February and March, respectively. And so those were what we did, it\u2019s pretty much kind of in that same category in April. Somewhere \u2013 it\u2019s kind of just trended back to that 1,550-pound range, and again we would like to see that moving north right now. Now I think with the shipments and the tonnage, we got more tonnage in the first quarter than shipments, and that can be a better thing, but you start getting to a point where the weight per shipment stays kind of flat, we can have more shipment growth than weight like we did in \u201815. Scott Group : Okay. So if weight per shipment then is, call it flattish year-over-year, kind of in the second quarter so far. Should \u2013 I\u2019m guessing, rev per hundredweight should be better in the second quarter than what we saw in the first quarter. Is that fair? Adam Satterfield : If weight per shipment stays about the same as in the second quarter as the first then I think the revenue per hundredweight would be around the same point. We would like to see it increasing a little bit sequentially as we\u2019ve got contracts that turn over and we\u2019ll be getting increases on those. Scott Group : I was thinking on a year-over-year basis. Adam Satterfield : Year-over-year basis? Scott Group : Yes. Adam Satterfield : Even on a year-over-year basis, in the second quarter of last year the weight per shipment was 1,559. And so we\u2019re right in that same ballpark, so perhaps from where we are, you may see some acceleration in that year-over-year change there. Scott Group : Okay. Okay. And then... Adam Satterfield : 2.4% that we just did in the first quarter. Scott Group : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then if I look typically from the first quarter to the second quarter, it looks like you get \u2013 the operating ratio improves 4 points maybe 5 points. Adam Satterfield : It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve done 5 points, Scott. Scott Group : Okay. So 4 points, that\u2019s right. Yes. Okay. So 4 points. Given kind of what you\u2019re talking about of some of the incremental costs, should we be expecting something more muted than that or are there any other kind of factors that we should be thinking about as we\u2019re thinking about normal margin progression 1Q to 2Q? Adam Satterfield : The average is about 400 basis points. As you said, the last 2 years, it\u2019s improved about 360 basis points, I think, in 2015 and 2016. So I think based on the comments that we made about increased cost into the second quarter from the first that we really haven\u2019t had in years past. It\u2019s going to be more of a challenge, I guess, to get to that number than we had in other years. Scott Group : Okay. But you\u2019re not quantifying how much of an impact that cost inflation is going to have? Adam Satterfield : We did say that we anticipated inflation now at about 4% for the year, really. And it was, if you take cost, and I\u2019m excluding fuel from that, obviously fuel is up over 20% in the first quarter. But it was about 3% cost inflation on a per shipment basis in the first quarter. It would be 4-ish or so in the second quarter. Scott Group : Okay. And just last thing real quick. Do you think fuel on a net basis was a positive or negative for you in the quarter? Adam Satterfield : That\u2019s always a hard one and a slippery slope, I think. It was something that we deal with as the prices go up and down. And last year, it was down all year, and we deal with that when you go through your pricing conversations with your customers, and what\u2019s the ultimate, what\u2019s the revenue that a customer brings to us, and what are the costs associated with handling that business. Now in the short run, obviously, if you got a little bit more fuel surcharge revenue then that creates probably a little bit of leverage on nonfuel-related, petroleum-related product costs, but certainly we\u2019re seeing tremendous cost inflation in the operating supplies and expenses line, and it\u2019s not only fuel but it\u2019s other lubricant, tires, any kind of petroleum-based products. We generally get cost increases when fuel is higher. Scott Group : Okay. Thanks a lot for the time guys. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ariel Rosa with Bank of America. Ariel Rosa : Hi, good morning guys. Nice quarter and in challenging environment. So first question, wanted to touch on the cadence of CapEx. Throughout the year, what you think it might look like? And also if you could touch on what you think your ability might be to add trucks\u2019 profitability in this environment? Adam Satterfield : It will expand, $57 million in the first quarter and most of that was on the real estate side, very little in the equipment. And so generally, that starts picking up in the second and third quarters. Obviously, the new equipment that we\u2019re bringing in and cycling out the old, we\u2019d rather have it in our operations, and all of our new trucks, as you know, start out in line hauls. So we\u2019re putting the most fuel efficient equipment on the road to get the most mileage out of. So we would like to have that in place as business starts picking up through the second quarter. And on the real estate side, it really just \u2013 it varies from year-to-year based on any kind of projects or if there is a large item that is in the mix that may have been a leased facility that we buy and so forth, but on the equipment side, that\u2019s the one that\u2019s more standard in the spend, so that\u2019s what impacts the income statement the most as well. The land and structure is not a significant of an impact. Ariel Rosa : And Adam, could you touch maybe on that question about ability to add to the fleet profitability? Greg Gantt : This is Greg. Right now, we\u2019re expecting if business continues to accelerate, we\u2019re expecting to hold some trades if we need to. We\u2019ll see where that goes. We\u2019re not getting rid of the old part of our fleet as our equipment comes on, we\u2019ll hold that and get rid of it as we deem that we need it or not. So that\u2019s where we are right now. We know we can add to the fleet if we need to. How quick? We just have to wait and see at the time. But right now, there are no plans to do that. Our first attempt will be to keep our trades a little bit longer till we get in the slower season. We\u2019ll keep them as long as we need to. Ariel Rosa : Okay, fair enough. That\u2019s a solid answer. And then just quickly if you can just talk about kind of what the competitors\u2019 environment looks like, and if you\u2019re seeing opportunities for new bids coming in the door? If you\u2019re seeing customers switching more frequently given kind of what\u2019s going on with ELDs and maybe some flow-through from truckload? Adam Satterfield : None that we\u2019re seeing anything different from normal at this point. Especially, on the ELD side, I think it\u2019s probably a little early for that. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty as to what that\u2019s going to do from a current capacity standpoint and long-term capacity standpoint in the truckload environment, but I\u2019ll say that we are well positioned, and we think, maybe the best positioned LTL carrier from the investments that we\u2019ve historically made in network capacity, in our ability to hire and bring on drivers and so forth to meet growth. We\u2019ve done it before and we think that we\u2019ll be able to do it again. But we are sitting, I would say, with at least probably on average 25% capacity in the real estate network and so we think that gives us a tremendous advantage and heads-up and handle growth if it comes our way. Ariel Rosa : Okay. Great. That\u2019s really helpful. And then just really quickly, my last one. A number of carriers mentioned about some challenging conditions in California. Just wanted to hear if you guys experienced any of that? And if those challenges have abated? Adam Satterfield : Every day. Ariel Rosa : Fair enough. But it sounds like it was pretty bad at the start of first quarter and maybe now has alleviated a little bit? Is that fair to say or are you guys still seeing some network fluidity issues? Adam Satterfield : Nothing we can\u2019t deal with. It\u2019s not stopping us, we\u2019re dealing with them as they come up, but nothing we can\u2019t work around. Ariel Rosa : Okay, fair enough. Thanks for the time. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ben Hartford with Baird. Ben Hartford : Hi, good morning guys. Adam, a few modeling questions. Did you provide the actual tonnage growth year-over-year in March or for March? Adam Satterfield : The actual for March was 3.5%. Ben Hartford : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then can I confirm the working days progression this year and next year? Adam Satterfield : Yes. Hang on a second. Let me get to it. So 64 days in the first quarter, 64 days in the second, 63 days in the third and 62 days in the fourth quarter. Ben Hartford : And then next year, do we get a 64, 64, 64, 62? Adam Satterfield : Actually 64, 64, 63, 63. Ben Hartford : Okay. The tax \u2013 relatively effective tax rate for the balance of this year and any placeholder for \u201818? Adam Satterfield : Well, we said 38.6% for the second quarter, but I guess we will have to continue to wait and see what comes out of Washington and your guess is good as ours in terms of where corporate taxes go. But right now, if trends continue, 38.6% is kind of what our annual effective tax rate is. Ben Hartford : Okay. That\u2019s great. And then now that you instituted the dividends, how do you think about, from your standpoint, how do you think about any sort of progression from that $0.10 per share quarterly dividend? Is there a dividend yield target that you have in mind? Are you taking a wait-and-see approach? How are you thinking about planning future dividends here going forward? Adam Satterfield : Yes. It\u2019s more of a wait-and-see approach. And like I said we want our share repurchases really to be the primary form of returning capital. But obviously we\u2019ve got a very strong balance sheet with debt-to-capital at 4.7% and we continue to look for opportunities along our capital allocation plan for where we can allocate additional capital and we\u2019ve got a heavy CapEx spend again this year. But we\u2019ll continue to look at ways primarily to invest in our LTL business first and we\u2019ll continue to look at the other ways to invest in some of the other smaller businesses that we have, the non-LTL services are mainly drayage, our truckload brokerage. And see if there\u2019s anything else along those lines. But \u2013 and kind of \u2013 there will just be a continual evaluation, I guess. We\u2019re still early with the dividend, and we will continue to look at it and talk about it with the senior management through the board. Ben Hartford : Sure. Makes sense and last one if I could. The other revenue line item was down about 50% year-over-year. What was the driver of that and what\u2019s the representative number for an annualized other revenue figure for \u201817? Adam Satterfield : Yes, actually the non-LTL revenue was $13.9 million and that compares to $13.2 million in the first quarter of 2016, and I think a lot of people \u2013 I think, we\u2019ve talked about this before, but the statistics that we give, in our earnings release, they do not include the adjustment that we make at the end of every quarter for revenue recognition. And the reason we do that is we want the revenue to be a match with associated weight. So I think a lot of people are using our revenue per hundredweight and our weight to try to back into what LTL revenue is, and then the non-LTL piece. So a lot of times, people will miss and have that revenue recognition impacting the non-LTL. But it was actually an increase and most of that is coming through, we\u2019ve had a little bit of growth in our truckload brokerage business. Ben Hartford : Okay, that makes sense. Thank you, I appreciate it. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Campbell with Thompson Davis & Company. David Campbell : Hi, thank you very much. I was wondering if you could explain to me exactly what you\u2019re doing for Major League Baseball. In terms of delivering cargo, are you doing it to all baseball teams? And what percentage of the gain in freight in April would come from Major League Baseball? Is it a material number? Adam Satterfield : It\u2019s just another marketing and advertising opportunity just like any other opportunity along those lines that we might have. And so it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t know, if it\u2019s ever possible to say that one piece of freight came from a commercial or a trade publication or what not, but we felt like it was a good opportunity. You\u2019ll start seeing the MLB logo on some of our trailers. There are opportunities with certain games, an All-Star Game, World Series and so forth. And we have separate deals with several teams that we use for various marketing and entertainment activities. So certainly, the objective with this is to continue to show an increase in brand recognition and ultimately we believe that it will be able to help us achieve some of our longer-term market share growth objectives. David Campbell : So it\u2019s more of a promotional cost than it is a revenue growth? Adam Satterfield : Well, certainly, we hope and believe that it will lead to revenue growth. But I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just like any type of marketing advertising. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint a one-for-one relationship. Greg Gantt : We have multiple forms of advertising. Adam Satterfield : Okay, thank you very much. All the other questions have been answered. Thank you. Operator : And we have one question remaining in queue at this time. We will go next to Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Tyler Brown : Hi, good morning guys. Adam, I know you noted a higher weight, lower length of haul negatively impacting the yields. But I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re seeing any changes in the more let\u2019s call it the less talked about characteristic of class and specifically, are you seeing any downward pressure in class as the industrial economy is kind of stabilized here? Adam Satterfield : Not per say, nothing that stands out from one material direction or the other in movement there. But you\u2019re right. I mean class is the other element of mix that really is never talked about but they can certainly have an impact there. Tyler Brown : Okay. And then can you quantify the improvement in line haul and P&D? Greg Gantt : Quantify the improvements? Adam Satterfield : Yes, we had in the line haul, our latent load average improved 0.9% and our P&D shipments per hour improved 1.6%. Tyler Brown : 1.6%, okay. Then Adam, this is a bigger picture question, and I know you don\u2019t give guidance, but can you just talk about whether you think the OR can improve for the full year. I mean, if you\u2019ve got unit cost inflation tracking up 4%, your contract renewal of say, mix adjusted or whatever are probably up less than that. Do you feel that there is operating leverage that can make up the difference or just any thoughts there if you\u2019re willing? Adam Satterfield : You know I may borrow a line from my mentor Westfried to say, yes, we don\u2019t give guidance on the OR. But \u2013 obviously, every day, we\u2019re focused on trying to drive productivity and improvement to the bottom line and we want profitable growth and we\u2019re managing the business to generate that. So certainly, we\u2019re focused on it and a lot of it is going to be just dependent on the revenue growth for the balance of the year. And as we said earlier, and even in this quarter, we had a big headwind on the depreciation line and so that\u2019s just sort of getting things right sized and kind of growing back into the network, the investments that we made last year, and certainly, we didn\u2019t think it was a wise decision. We could have eliminated a lot of equipment last year. And we think that, that would have been very shortsighted. But now, we are getting back into it. And we think that we can generate leverage. We\u2019ve said many times, the long-term key is for margin improvement on improving density and improving yield. But you need a positive macro and economic environment to support and pricing environment to support those initiatives. And certainly now, we\u2019re getting the benefit of added volumes and network density. The yield is still trending in the right direction and the economy seems to be improving. So perhaps we get all of those ingredients working for us this year. Tyler Brown : Okay, I appreciate the time. Operator : There are no further questions from the phone. I will turn the call back to Adam Satterfield for closing remarks. Adam Satterfield : Well, thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and please feel free to give us a call, if you have anything further. Thanks and have a great day. Operator : And this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you again for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to the company's' Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David Congdon. Please go ahead, sir. David Congdon : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter conference Call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our Chief Financial Officer. After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. I'll point out that I'm off-site today, so if we're not totally smooth with taking your questions and doing the responses, please forgive us.  So Old Dominion's operating momentum accelerated during the second quarter as strong growth in tons in revenue per hundredweight generated company records for revenue, EPS and operating ratio. The 11.2% increase in revenue and 21.4% increase in diluted earnings per share are the best growth rates for these metrics we have had in over 2 years.  Our growth for the quarter, again, validated the strength and soundness of our long term business model which we've discussed with you for many years now. The 6.1% growth in tons for the quarter produced better freight density and improvement in our yield as reflected in the 3.8% increase in revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge. The combination of density -- increased density and yield, along with incremental improvements in productivity for the quarter drove the 140 basis point improvement in our operating ratio to an 80.9%. The success of our business model is no surprise to us or anyone who has studied our historical results over the economic cycles of the past 20 years, but that success is not automatic and required significant effort and commitment. First and foremost, our success is dependent on the consistent long term and high-quality execution by each of our outstanding employees. The commitment and hard work of our team is reflected in our industry-leading service with on-time deliveries in excess of 99% and a cargo claim ratio that has improved to a new company record of less than 2/10 of 1%.  In addition, we strongly support our team's ability to deliver superior service through our long term capital expenditure strategy which is designed to create operating capacity that can absorb anticipated gains and market share. This investment is not only for tractors, trailers and service centers, but also includes substantial expenditures on technology infrastructure to enhance both our pickup and delivery visibility for our customers and our internal operating efficiencies.  Looking ahead, we remain cautiously optimistic about the economy and other industry dynamics that could affect supply and demand. While we will continue to be prudent with our approach to managing labor and equipment capacity, we believe Old Dominion is in the best position -- Old Dominion is the best positioned company in the LTL industry to benefit from an improving economy. We've consistently demonstrated our ability to win market share by continuing to deliver a value proposition of superior on-time claim-free service at a fair price. We're confident that continued execution, combined with our financial strength and available capacity will produce additional long term growth and shareholder value.  Thanks for your time this morning. And now, Adam will discuss the second quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, David and good morning. The second quarter of 2017 turned out to be a record quarter in many ways for Old Dominion. We set new company records for revenue, operating ratio and earnings per diluted share.  Our revenue increased 11.2% to $839.9 million and our operating ratio improved 140 basis points to 80.9%. The combination of these factors allowed us to increase earnings per diluted share by 21.4% to $1.19. We believe our results for the quarter were due to continued improvement in the domestic economy as well as the consistent execution of our long term strategic plan.  Three basic elements of superior service, fair price and network capacity, all worked in harmony to produce profitable growth. Our revenue increase for the second quarter reflects an increase of both LTL tons per day and yield.  LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 5.1% and increase 3.8% when excluding fuel surcharges. LTL tons per day increased 6.1% as compared to the second quarter of 2016 with LTL shipments per day increasing 5.6% and LTL weight per shipment increasing 0.5%. We were pleased with the strength of our volumes as we finished the quarter as June LTL tons per day increased 7.8% as compared to June of 2016. This was higher than our year-over-year growth rates for April and May, primarily due to a 1.2% increase in LTL weight per shipment for June.  Our revenue growth in July had continued at a double-digit pace, although it is slightly below the overall pace of growth for the second quarter. Month-to-date, our LTL tons per day have increased 6.7%. As a reminder, the third quarter of 2017 has 63 workdays which is 1 less than the third quarter of 2016. Our second quarter operating ratio improved 140 basis points to 80.9%, primarily due to the improvement on variable operating costs. Salaries, wages and benefit cost as a percent of revenue improved 150 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2016. We were extremely pleased with the efforts of our team members to manage this volume growth, while also maintaining superior service. As stated in our release this morning, we do intend to hire additional employees in the third quarter in anticipation of continued growth, while we know that there could be a short term negative impact on productivity metrics as a result.  While most of our operating costs improved as a percent of revenue, general supplies and expenses increased 40 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2016. Among other things, the 24% increase in these costs reflects additional advertising and marketing-related costs that were mentioned in our first quarter earnings call. We expect the similar level of general supplies and expenses for the third quarter.  Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $127.7 million for the second quarter and $238.5 million for the first half of 2017. Capital expenditures were $131.3 million for the quarter and $188.3 million for the first 6 months of 2017.  Due to our current volume trends and increased confidence for further growth, we increased our capital expenditure plan for 2017 by $15 million to purchase additional revenue equipment. As a result, we now expect total capital expenditures of approximately $400 million for this year.  We returned $15.3 million of capital to our shareholders during the second quarter and $23.6 million for the first half of the year. We have $192.8 million still available for stock repurchases under our current $250 million stock repurchase program.  Our effective tax rate for the second quarter is 38.6% as compared to 38.4% for the second quarter of 2016. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be 38.6% in the third quarter of 2017. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor at this time for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Fowler : Adam, your comment about the additional investments into the third quarter. Can you give us an order of magnitude either what you're thinking about from headcount or maybe the impact on the OR sequentially that the potential investments that you have to make going forward could have? Adam Satterfield : Yes, sure, Todd, this is Adam. And right now, when you look at where we were in the second quarter, our shipments were up 5.5% to say, 5.6% and our average number of full-time employees is only up 1%. So we're somewhat lagging from a headcount standpoint with shipment growth when typically we like to lead with headcount growth to make sure that we've got people in place and trained because the most important thing for us is to make sure we don't have any sacrifice in service. So we certainly had employees working hard during the second quarter to manage the volume growth that we had and we actually had to use a little bit of purchase transportation as well. So we've got a little -- we did some hiring. We actually the -- actual headcount growth at the end of June was up about 280 employees over March. But we've got to catch up a little bit with where we're. So we're thinking somewhere in the magnitude of probably a couple 100 employees, maybe a 2% to 3% increase, somewhat it's just a measure of continuing to manage our labor with our volume growth. And we always do a good job with managing labor to revenue, but we may have got a little bit behind the curve, a little bit on our hiring. Todd Fowler : Okay. That helps and that makes sense. And I guess, maybe just to quantify if the third quarter OR versus the second quarter OR is typically down, let's call it 50 basis points or so, would the expectation be then that because of that catch up, maybe something different than the historical trend? Adam Satterfield : It could be a little bit. And going back to what happened in the second quarter, obviously, with managing the additional volumes that we had with our people, we leveraged up hours and we didn't have to incur the -- that fringe benefit cost. But going into the third quarter, we mentioned, we're going to have to buy some additional equipment and that was primarily on the trailer side and we had to do some rentals last quarter. And so we're making up for some of that. But as we add people, achieving the normal 50 basis point increase going into the third quarter could be a little difficult. But as -- I think, we've said many times before, it always comes back to volume growth which drives density and yield performance in terms of what we can do on the overall operating ratio and I think that we performed very well in the second quarter. And we've got some good growth trends happening thus far into the third. We do -- this is a little bit of an anomaly with only 63 days in the third quarter. So we will have 1 less day of revenue as well. Todd Fowler : Okay. And then maybe just for my last one. David, if you have any comments just on contract renewals and industry pricing here in the quarter. Obviously, it's a good quarter from a yield perspective. But it looks like a little bit of benefit from a shorter length of haul. So can you speak a little bit to what you're seeing with your contract renewals and just some general comments on -- your thoughts on industry pricing, I think that would be helpful? David Congdon : We generally -- our contracts achieved 3% to 4%, pretty much tied to inflation and cost. That's -- part of our formula is be fair and equitable with our customers. So there was no real major change there. But the industry pricing dynamics, I think, we're still in a very disciplined environment right now. We don't see any major irrational pricings with the exception of the occasional irrational behavior you might see just -- I mean, it's very spotty and usually when you see a competitor put in a price that's drastically cheaper than ours, I just don't know the handling characteristics or I think their shipment in the dark. But there is no irrational players out there at this moment. We're happy about that. Operator : We will go next to Allison Landry at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Allison Landry : I wanted to ask about e-commerce and the broader trends that we're seeing sort of in the retail supply chain, whereby sort of moving away from a traditional supply chain to one, where you have more fulfillment centers and distribution centers that are closer to the end consumer, more inventory, faster turns. So as you think about that, for the secular trend, the longer term, do you think that ultimately, LTL benefits from like a model shift away potentially from long-haul trucking. Are you seeing that now? Or is that something that you would expect to happen over time? David Congdon : We think it will happen to some degree over time. If a shipper goes from 2 major distribution centers, 1 in the east, 1 in the west to 15 or 20 fulfillment centers more closely located to their customers, they're not going to need as many full truckloads into those multiple fulfillment centers. And you would think there would be a shift toward more LTL as a consequence. And second part of that is that our value proposition -- our 99% on-time service, very fast transit times and regional, inter-regional long-haul lanes, our cargo claim ratio, all of that, I think, plays into the LTL that moves into both DCs and fulfillment centers because whoever's product it is, they certainly want it on the shelf quickly and they don't want damages. And that's where we shine. Allison Landry : Are you seeing any customers whether it's an e-tailer or a brick-and-mortar, are you seeing any customers approach you to sort of figure out ways outside of using small package, for example? Have you seen any of that. And what are you hearing sort of from customers in this respect? Adam Satterfield : Yes, not so much on really small package side, Allison, but certainly, we're, every day, talking with customers and as they continue to transform their businesses and supply chains, we're dealing with that, where we've got packages going into the distribution centers and fulfillment centers, as David mentioned. And we're getting some good growth in those next-day and second-day lanes as evidenced by the decrease in our length of haul. The other piece of this is on the middle mile side as well, where you've got the goods going from a fulfillment center closer to a final delivery agent for those larger bulky-type items and that's usually a sold good. So as David mentioned earlier, service is going to be critically important. So we feel good in that regard in terms of the service product that we have and the available network capacity. The critical piece though is just ensuring that you are getting paid appropriately for committing that level of capacity to the customers. Allison Landry : Right. And then just one last question on this. As FedEx has talked about using, I think, 24-foot trucks in their LTL division so that it is easier to actually deliver some of those larger items to residents. Is that something that you guys would be able to participate in as well? Adam Satterfield : Right now, we've talked about home deliveries and so forth in the past as part of our strategic planning process and we still evaluate it. And there are certain customers that may demand that we have an option. And if you recall, we had a white glove service offering years ago and we ended up -- we were using agents and it wasn't at the same level of service offering that our normal LTL product is. So we moved away from it. But I think there is other opportunities for us in terms of committing capacity. We're making some residential deliveries today that's less than 2% of shipments and there are add-on fees that go along with that and certainly it can be difficult haul in a 48-foot van through a residential neighborhood. But as we continue to look in terms of that final mile delivery into homes, it's just what are the profit potentials there in terms of the rate that can be charged, what the handling characteristics and density [indiscernible] and ultimately we've had a profitable business or not to add on to our existing suite of services. Operator : We will go next to Scott Group at Wolfe Research. Unidentified Analyst : It's actually Rob Salmon [ph] on for Scott. I was curious if you could give us a little bit more color in terms of the July update. Could you talk to the impact of the fourth and just sequentially June to July. How that's compared to your historical trends that you've seen over the years? Adam Satterfield : Sure. Yes, I mean, certainly, that first week, the way the days fell for this -- really for June and for the rest of the year, it set up nicely to finish June on a strong note and then we started out that first week of July a little bit softer. So we've been seeing nice growth as we move through the month of July, though. Yes, when going back to June, the normal sequential increase from May to June on the weight side is 2.1%, we were actually up 4.3%. Now part of that was shipments were above what the normal sequential trend would have been as well. Shipment, the 10-year average is 1.4% increase over May, we were up 2.3%. So what we saw was a nice increase in weight per shipment as we finished June. And I think that as you've seen from truckload reports for the second quarter that things are probably getting a little bit tighter out there. Our weight per shipment so far into July has cycled back down a little bit closer to where we were in April and May. And so some of that is we're managing some of these volume flows in those business moves that are coming in to make sure they are not disrupting our other LTL business and many of these moves that we're doing are for existing LTL customers and they are just heavier weighted LTL shipments. But anyways, we would have expected with that 4.3% sequential increase into June that July would be below trend. So normally July is 2.1% decrease and we're having a little bit more decrease on the weight side, but a piece of that is related to, as I mentioned, that weight per shipment is below where we were in June. Unidentified Analyst : That's really helpful. I guess, if we're thinking about kind of incrementals, they were very strong in the quarter in excess of 30%. If I'm kind of aggregating the impact of 1 fewer working day as well as the expected headcount growth, how should we be thinking about incrementals this quarter in relationship to the performance in Q2? Adam Satterfield : That's a good question, Rob. And we've certainly had quarters in the past, especially when you are in accelerating type of environment where we've had around 30% incremental margins. And -- over the long run, we say that we're more focused on 20%. Now going into the third quarter, we've got to see will these volume trends continue to hold and show nice acceleration that will be a big piece of it. Certainly, those other factors, will we keep it at that 30%, that might be a big ask. Will it be as low as 20% in 1 quarter's time, I wouldn't expect. So somewhere probably in the middle. David Congdon : Yes my comment to that, Rob, would be that we're experiencing just solid, yet moderate and very manageable growth right now. It's kind of putting this in a sweet spot. And when you combine the quality of the revenue that we do handle with the cost structure that we have against that revenue, continued slight improvements in productivity. And the headcount is less than -- is probably 2.5% maybe. Overall, we're anticipating less than 3% anyway. And with the shipments increasing at a -- shipments and tonnage at probably a greater rate than the headcount, I would hope that you'll continue to see -- I expect that we will continue to see some pretty strong incremental margin. So things feel really good right now. Operator : We will go next to Amit Mehrotra at Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : So just wanted a follow-up on the comment you just made about things looking really good right now. On one side in the quarter, we did finally see pull on industrial production and truckload capacity is -- finally appears to be tightening. But kind of on the other hand, there is a lot of like industrial activity, energy sector activity growth in the quarter that may be kind of driving growth in excess of maybe what you would see normally. And that piece of it doesn't necessarily look like it's sustainable at least in the current oil price environment. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on -- you guys are ready to start ramping up labor and investing in fixed asset, but you have kind of all the stars that are aligned in the second quarter that may not necessarily be extrapolated into the back half. So just wanted to get your thoughts on the -- as it relates to industrial production and then also the energy economy? David Congdon : Yes, I will take that one. We -- I was just reading a pretty detailed report this morning, for example, that GDP is expected to be 2.2% in '17 and grow to 2.4% in '18, manufacturing from 1.7% in '17 to 2.4% in '18, TL capacity in terms of tractor count is all about -- a little less than 6% which means the capacity is tightening there. Housing start have gotten back up to an average level. The ISM at 57.8% appears as strong as it was in the positive cycles of 2010 and 2014. Construction spending is up. Retail sales is up. All that sales sounds good to me. But -- so I'm -- as we said in the release, we're cautiously optimistic that the economy will continue to behave nicely. And with that combined with rational behavior of the industry and from a pricing standpoint, I think we're set up right now to have a good year this year and a good year going into '18. Amit Mehrotra : Yes, I certainly hope that's the case. And just maybe for our own help, if you could help -- Adam, could you help us with trying to understand, if you look at the business as a whole, whether it's shipments or revenue, in terms how much of that is exposed to rig counts completion derivative effects on that? And how much is exposed to a lot of the just broader stuff that you just talked about and which obviously is signaling at least positive growth over the next 1.5 years? Just to help us sort of sensitize ourselves to maybe the exposure there would be helpful? Adam Satterfield : Yes, about 60% of our revenue is industrial related and we don't have a tremendous amount of exposure to rig counts and really the energy industry. And I mean there is an element of it that's there. I think just to tag on to what David was saying though was that we've started seeing improvement in ISM numbers and we were kind of waiting around for it to see when it is going to really be translated into our numbers and especially you go back into last year, it just seemed like the economy was so choppy, we couldn't get any sustained momentum really with the economy, nor could we get it in our own volume trends. And I think we're finally starting to see some things at least from a sustainability standpoint. Our volume trends staying in line with where we'd expect they would be. I think the other thing is just as some freight is potentially coming back into the LTL environment that you're seeing some volume increases with some of the other carriers. And as a result, rates are going up. And over the last 1.5 years, we talked about the fact that and we were questioned often about our market share gains and we said if you look along the price and service continuum that maybe shippers were weighing price more than they were service. And I think now that some of the other carriers are increasing rate that you're seeing a shift maybe back to equilibrium. And so -- and I think when pricing is more in line, we feel that, that we have a service advantage and that's demonstrated in our 99% on-time and claims are less than 0.10% and we certainly have got available network capacity. So we're back in the sweet spot of growth of -- we built up all the network capacity. We're able to grow into it. We're getting more and more customer feedback of coming back to us for service. And so we feel good about just the industry dynamics and, as a result, our positioning for some continued growth. Certainly, we're not going to go out. I mean, we increased our CapEx by $15 million for equipment. And equipment capacity is a little easier to get. We long have a long term plan of investing in our real estate network and maintaining excess network capacity. We can get the equipment capacity, now the final piece is making sure that we've got the people in place to be able to continuously pickup and deliver our freight on time to make sure that [indiscernible] jeopardized in any way and that's what we're addressing right now. Operator : And we will go next to David Ross with Stifel. David Ross : So ABF came out with cubic minimum charge which we think is opening the door for similar dimensional pricing in the LTL system. What are you guys thinking on changing the rate structure, pricing structure and the potential for going to an all DIM pricing model sooner rather than later? David Congdon : Yes, we created and have a density tariff that we've had for, gosh, little over 5 or 6 years ago, maybe even longer. And we've just not seen that much demand for that particular tariff, but I mean, logic says that we can't keep raising base rates and raising discounts and it makes no sense to have 90% discount. So at some point in time, there's either got to be a reset of the rate structures to bring the discount levels down or some move toward dimensional pricing. So we're prepared for it and can accommodate dimensional pricing now. David Ross : I think it's not really a demand issue. Shippers were demanding that UPS and FedEx change their DIM divisor or that they change their fuel surcharge program. It's just a matter of, I guess, willingness on the carrier side to make the pricing change. David Congdon : Adam, you want to take a shot at that. Adam Satterfield : Yes. I think it's just going to come back to you when you've got so many shippers, especially the -- your smaller mom and pops that just don't have the systems in place and in many cases, may not even have scales. And so it will just be an added element of complexity, perhaps and we're not sure that the shipper community is ready for. We've been talking about it for probably a decade and trying to get ready for. Somewhat we've managed to it by having the dimensioners in our facilities and costing to make sure that we're accounting for the cube space in our trailers. It's just going to be a matter of, if anyone and others in the industry like to push for, I don't think that we would be out there to push and demand and say, this is the only way to account for it. But the way we try to account for it is measuring the weight and density and audits and inspections of the freight that we're handling and then going back to our customers and saying this may not be the type of freight we that agreed to from a pricing standpoint and making adjustments in real time. I think we've been pretty successful with that. And that's why we've had such good yield performance. But we're probably not there to necessarily go out and draw that for the industry. Operator : We will go next to Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Christian Wetherbee : I wanted to ask a little bit about sort of the cost cadence, again, as we think about, but specifically on so the advertising, I think it's sort of a seasonal dynamic that's going to run through into the fall. But give us a little bit sense of how we should be thinking about -- I don't know, if you can give us a specific number from 2Q, but maybe how we should think about that lapping or maybe falling off in 3Q? Or does it stick around and then go away in 4Q? Just trying to get a sense of maybe how that specifically plays out. Adam Satterfield : Yes. And in my comments this morning, I mentioned that in general supplies and expenses, we had about a 24% increase compared to the second quarter of last year. And it was a pretty good step-up in pace from where we were in the first quarter. And we expected that. I mean, it's in line with the seasonal build of freight and so some of the things that we were doing were targeted in that regard. So -- and I would expect our general supplies and expenses to be in a similar type of range in the third quarter as they were in the second. And then you should have some cycling down as we go into the fourth, similar to a bell curve with lower cost in the first and fourth quarters and little bit higher cost in the second and third. Some of those costs that are in those -- that line item are variable in nature. So there is certainly some natural fluctuation that's going up and down with our volume trends there as well. Christian Wetherbee : Okay. That's helpful. And when you talked about them last quarter, I think there was some expectation that there could be some revenue attached to it and obviously, tonnage growth was solid in the quarter and this is getting, I guess, maybe a bit too granular, but trying to get a sense of maybe what your initial impressions have been with the sort of push higher on the advertising side, noticed mostly on the MLB side, but -- how the revenue sort of uptake or results have been from this push in advertising? David Congdon : It's hard though -- that's -- measuring the return on marketing expense is one of the most difficult calculations you can try to make. And we're really still very new into our relationship with MLB and we plan to have a long term relationship there too. So we watch our marking budget every year and it's just an expense item that's on the -- makes a part of our cost structure. But we think it's a very necessary thing to continue to build our brand awareness and build customer loyalty. So we remain committed to marketing. Christian Wetherbee : Okay. And so from market share perspective, what we see in the quarter on performance has been, you probably call, consistent with your typical ability to gain share within the market. David Congdon : I think we haven't seen all of the results for the second quarter of our competitors. So it will be interesting to see how our growth rates stack up. But going back to my comments a little bit ago, the good news is that we're bringing on the truck line, is -- it's solid, well priced. It's in our cost structure and is generating incremental margins. So others might grow equal to us or maybe a little bit faster. But you were not seeing the growth come with solid growth in yield and solid growth in tonnage. And we've got both. Operator : We will go next to Ravi Shanker at Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : A few follow-ups here to some of the prior comments. First, on the kind of e-commerce collections. When you're going to look at with your business and gets LTL as a whole, just how much of revenue do you think comes from, I know just filling inventories for retail stores or doing the FC to store move. And kind of why should that change over time from being, what I believe, today is more of a TL business to be more of an LTL business? Adam Satterfield : At this point, retail for us is somewhere in the 25% of our revenue ballpark. And we're not doing as much of the fulfillment center to store and so forth that you mentioned. But I think for -- in terms of the general big picture of why it may move from truckload into LTL, I think David hit at it earlier, when you think about the increased number of fulfillment centers versus larger scale distribution centers covering the region, these fulfillment centers are managing a significant number of SKUs and they are not going to be bringing in multiple or large quantity of goods. It's going to be more of increased number of SKUs, rapid inventory replenishment. We think that really bodes well for us and our service capabilities. But naturally unless there is change in dynamics within the truckload industry with shift to lower weighted goods in the LTL industry, we just think that that's going to be a continued change in dynamic. Now in terms of whether or not we stay so focused on that, it's certainly an opportunity and again, it's an LTL opportunity. But lot of things will come back to industry capacity and where other carriers are, what carriers focus on some of those retail growth. We anticipate there will be continued growth within the industrial segment of the business. And so that may free up and other opportunities with existing customers and new customers across other elements and businesses. So until you see any measurable increase in capacity by the other carriers, we see opportunity across multiple fronts. Ravi Shanker : Got it. That makes sense. Second, on ELDs, I think you mentioned that you're obviously looking forward to truck capacity tightening later this year. Do you think that the kind of spillover of the pricing impact from TL to LTL is concurrent? Or do you think there is a little bit of either? Adam Satterfield : There probably was a little bit of some spillover in our numbers in June and I mentioned, our weight per shipment going up. And that's something that we've got to manage and control here. I think, I mentioned earlier that some of these volume loads that we handled were with existing LTL customer accounts and perhaps that we're struggling to find a suitable capacity in the TL sector. Some of this too may have been and we talked about this the last few quarters, that we think that there is a fringe element of truckload carriers that were out looking for 10,000, 15,000-pound shipments that normally would move by LTL and especially in the 3PL segment, they were able to secure capacity at a lower rate on the TL carrier. And you may find a TL that was willing to handle multiple stops and doing some different things that may have been outside of their sweet spot, absent other volume. So some of those dynamics come back into the play where normal shipments that will move LTL moved by LTL and TL stays in its world and that bodes well for everyone. We've just got to be careful and I mentioned this earlier that we're not taking on volume loads at the expense of other LTL shipments such that it may impact service in any way for us and any volume loads that we're taking on have got to be priced accordingly for the capacity that we're taking up. Ravi Shanker : Understood. Very helpful. And just lastly, I think you mentioned earlier a 6.7% tonnage growth in July which was a bit of a deceleration sequentially. Can you just confirm that, that is not adjusted for the 4th of July holiday? Adam Satterfield : Yes, that -- we don't do adjusted. So that's just the rate of growth where we're. And certainly, that first week I mentioned was a little bit slower and that plays into the month-to-date average. But that's just where we're and keep in mind too what I mentioned about the fact that weight per shipment is down a little bit. So -- and our shipment growth in July is slightly below, but there is multiple factors that come into play with these things. The shipment is -- right now is up a little over 5.5%. Shipment growth in June was up 6.5%. So it is a slight deceleration, but all-in, I mentioned that our revenue is growing. It's just slightly below the pace. The revenue in July is slightly below the pace that we had for all of the second quarter. So you've got the volumes and the yield components coming into play. And on the yield side, there will be some compression in terms of fuel surcharge revenue in the third quarter as well as fuel is more normalized where it was increasing last year and it's -- actually the last few weeks been decreasing. Operator : We will go next to Brad Delco with Stephens. Scott Schoenhaus : This is actually Scott Schoenhaus on for Brad. I just wanted to follow-up on the pricing environment. Some of your peers recently putting GRIs. Just wanted to see how you're thinking about rates to noncontractual customers. And as a follow-up, do you think we're set up as of right now for another round of GRIs in early 2018, particularly if we do get that TL spillover that seems to be already happening or setting up to be happening in the tightening capacity? Adam Satterfield : Yes, Scott, we haven't made any announcements at this point. If you remember, our GRI last year went into effect on September 26 and we're normally on a 10- to 11-month cycle. So we've had discussions along those lines and certainly, we've got cost increases that one would expect to have an increase, but we haven't made any announcement in terms of that as of yet. And second part of your question, whether or not some of the other carriers tried to go after the second rate increase or not, if you look kind of over the long run, the yield performance and kind of where industry margins are, we maintained all of last year that we felt like industry pricing would stay stable because of the fact of industry consolidation and where industry margins are and so I think some of the other carriers will continue to have a need to push for price. And certainly, as other carriers do that, we look at our ourselves, what we need to cover our cost inflation and that could bode well for us from a volume standpoint, if we don't need as much price as perhaps some of our competitors do. Scott Schoenhaus : That's very helpful. I guess, my last question is on driver pay. I think, you usually do a increase around September or October, usually around 3% to 3.5%. How should we think about this for this year, similar timing, similar rates? Or is it going to be a little bit more given it seems to be the LTL environment is more competitive? Adam Satterfield : Yes, we typically have an increase in the -- at the 1st of September. We haven't announced anything to our employees as of yet. We normally don't give the rate, but certainly, the factors that go into play when we make those decisions are how the company is performing, where we're at. And we take those into play. They've averaged 3% or so and I think that's what the increase was last year. And so we will make that announcement on the fourth quarter call, at least to the investment community once we go out and announce our plans to our employees. Operator : And we will go next to Ariel Rosa at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ariel Rosa : So just to start with, I was hoping you could address where some of the strength is that you're seeing? And what are some of the kind of regional differences across the country? So is it gaining share in the markets where you're strong? Or is it really kind of increasing penetration in some of the markets where you have less of a presence, that's really driving this -- the strong growth? Adam Satterfield : It has been pretty balanced actually which is what we would want and expect. We're probably -- we're getting some really good growth in the midwest region of the country. If you think about it, that's where we've added some capacity. Our Gulf Coast region, that's also seen a nice growth. We did just recently open our fourth terminal in the Chicagoland area. And it seems that as we continue to add capacity really around the country, there is demand there for our service product and we're able to increase growth. And we've talked about that's part of our long term plan for market share growth and we're continuing to look and evaluate real estate opportunities. We've got a far good list of about 35 to 40 service centers or so. And we continue to keep our eyes open to the demand for real estate. Typically in the markets where we're looking was continuously increasing. So we certainly will continue to look to add to our network where we can to make sure that the network does not become a limiting factor to our growth in any way. Ariel Rosa : And there was some chatter about competitors entering markets in the northeast. Could you maybe address kind of what you're seeing there? Are you seeing additional pressure in that market? David Congdon : We're not seeing any pressure as of yet in that market from the expansion of other carriers. Ariel Rosa : Okay, great. Very helpful. Just last one for me, obviously, the share buyback activity was a little bit slow this quarter, at least relative to kind of what we were expecting. Is that kind of trying to sort the balance sheet and prepare for this increased CapEx spending? Or is there something else kind of driving the thinking there? Adam Satterfield : No, I mean, I think our balance sheet is in really good shape. And with where our debt to cap is, it's just a measure of where the stock price has been and kind of what our thinking has been in the past of buying the stock when it's at a little lower price. And we bought fewer shares when our price has increased. So it's stepped up a little bit in terms of comparison to the first quarter, but it's still been light, I guess, in comparison to the pace of repurchase in 2016. But we will continue to evaluate sort of our strategies around capital return to our shareholders. We're continuously doing that. Operator : And we will go next to Tyler Brown at Raymond James. Patrick Brown : Adam, you made some high-level comments on 3PLs. But can you talk specifically about the trends there? Was that segment up in tonnage? It seems like they have been a bit erratic this year. Adam Satterfield : Yes, we actually had nice revenue growth in the third quarter -- or second quarter with our 3PLs and I think some of that maybe coming back to just shipper demands, available capacity within the industry and shipper demands for a little bit increased focus on service over price that I mentioned earlier. So yes, probably a little bit faster rate than the overall revenue growth for the company in the second quarter. I can't [indiscernible] on the 3PLs. Patrick Brown : Perfect. Okay. That's good color there. And then just a quick housekeeping item. But David, you mentioned P&D or linehaul productivity this quarter and how that trended, I assume both were fairly good. David Congdon : Yes, Adam, do you have those number to share? Adam Satterfield : Our P&D shipments per hour were increased 2.1% in the quarter. Our linehaul laden load average was up 1%. On the dock, we -- it was a little mix. Our shipments per hour were down about 0.6%, but our pounds handled per hour were up 0.6%. Again, we had an increase in weight per shipment and so forth. But those were a little mix there. But -- I think that we continue to be very efficient. We were hiring new people and there will be a productivity impact from those new hires, that's something that we anticipated. It could have a little bit of a dampening effect on the improved productivity that we just saw in the second quarter. Patrick Brown : Okay. No, that's great. And then just lastly, just a bigger picture question. But David, I always think of you guys as kind of industry pacesetters. And I'm just wondering if you've given any real contemplation regarding automation and I'm not talking about necessarily over the road, but do you think that automation could play a role on the dock or in the yard? And do you think that that's something realistic in the intermediate term? David Congdon : Well, as far as automation on the dock and in the yard, we already have it. I think, one of the steps that has been talked about for years, but we've never quite gotten there that could help on the dock might be some kind of RFID tags on each -- a pallet level RFID tag, not carton level, but a pallet level RFID could improve some productivity there. But -- and for the most part, we've got what it takes to -- we've got everything that's available to the industry right now on our dock and in our yards to manage those activities. Adam Satterfield : Tyler, just to add a little bit to that, in terms of some of the new technologies that come out, yes, we certainly stay focused on what's available. I think that we have evaluations of technologies and on the dock in terms of automated forklifts and things that we'll continue to look at it, but in a warehouse environment, it's a little bit different. I know you are familiar with a freight dock in the middle of the night, especially on a breakbulk location, is pretty hectic. There ever been a possibility of yard switchers and -- that's something, whether it's the technology for the switchers, whether it's technology in the trucks and we already have lane departure warning systems and [indiscernible] a radar collision mitigation system. But I think we will continue to see and we will continue to implement safety features on our trucks as they become available and they are viable. But that's something that we're always focused on. Certainly, we've got the strength to make the investments in when they are available. Operator : And at this time, we have no further questions in the phone queue. So I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Congdon for any additional or closing remarks. David Congdon : All right. Well, thank you all, for participating today. We appreciate all your questions. Feel free to give us a call, if you have anything further. We -- thank you and have a great day. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to the company\u2019s Executive Chairman, Mr. Earl Congdon. Please go ahead, sir. Earl Congdon : Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me today on the conference call is David Congdon, our Vice Chairman and CEO; and Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we\u2019ll be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion produced very strong operating and financial results for the third quarter of 2017, the second quarter in a row we reported double-digit revenue growth, improved our operating ratio by over 100 basis points and grew earnings per share by more than 20%. We have said many times before that we believe Old Dominion is the best-positioned company in the LTL industry. We continue to focus on winning market share by delivering superior on-time claims-free service at a fair price while maintaining network capacity to support our long-term growth initiatives. With favorable economic and industry trends continuing to date in the fourth quarter, our revenue growth has continued, and we are optimistic that we can complete 2017 on a strong note. Before turning the floor over to David, I want to recognize and thank the Old Dominion team for their performance during the third quarter. We faced plenty of challenges in the quarter, and yet, our team once again exceeded expectations. Thanks for being with us this morning, and now here is David to discuss the third quarter in greater detail. David Congdon : Thanks, Earl, and good morning. I second Earl\u2019s comments about the performance of our employees throughout our company. While we were very pleased to see the continuation of favorable economic environment, it takes strong and consistent execution to leverage these conditions. And the OD family continues to deliver 99% on-time delivery and achieved yet another record-breaking third quarter cargo claim ratio of 2.1%. Our third quarter results once again validated the financial profile we have discussed with you for many years. Our revenue growth that included increases in both freight density and yield, combined with other efficiency improvements, generated the operating leverage to improve margins by 120 basis points and produced a company-record third quarter operating ratio of 81.2%. How about that? I\u2019m pleased to report that the pricing environment has continued to remain rational. As you are all familiar, we have maintained a long-term, fair and consistent pricing strategy that focuses on increases necessary to offset the company\u2019s cost inflation. Our revenue per hundredweight as the metric most often used to talk about industry pricing is the yield metric and not always a true indicator of pricing. This detail is important because we don\u2019t manage our business to a certain revenue per hundredweight. Our yield management process instead focuses on individual account profitability that ultimately determines the profitability of the company. Along those lines, our revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 2.4% for the third quarter, which was a lower rate of growth than prior quarters. This rate, however, was impacted by a 1.8% increase in LTL weight per shipment for the quarter and a 6.5% decline in length of haul. Rising weight per shipment and lower length of haul typically have the impact of reducing revenue per hundredweight. While we have said this many times in the calls of its importance, we want to emphasize that we have not changed our pricing philosophy. As we make our way through the fourth quarter and start thinking about 2018, we intend to continue focusing on the execution of the various elements of our long-term strategic plan which has driven the success of our LTL business. We have consistently demonstrated our ability to win market share by continuing to deliver a value proposition of superior on-time claim-free service at a fair price. Anticipated growth will require continued investments in our service and our network, equipment capacity, and most importantly, our people, who are focused on exceeding our customers\u2019 expectations every day. We are confident that continued execution, combined with our financial strength and available network capacity can produce additional long-term growth in market share and shareholder value. Thanks for your time this morning, and now Adam will discuss the quarter in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, David, and good morning. Much like we did in the second quarter, Old Dominion set new company records for revenue and earnings in the third quarter of 2017. While we had one less operating day than the third quarter of 2016, our revenues increased 11.5% to $873 million, which is a new quarterly record. Our operating ratio also improved 120 basis points to 81.2%, and earnings per diluted share increased 20.4% to $1.24. Our revenue growth for the third quarter once again included a nice balance of increases in LTL tonnage and yield. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 3.6% and increased 2.4% when excluding fuel surcharges, as David mentioned in his comments. LTL tons per day increased to 8.6% as compared to the third quarter of 2016 with LTL shipments per day increasing 6.7% and LTL weight per shipment increasing 1.8%. LTL tons per day increased well above normal seasonality in September with a year-over-year increase of 11.3% as compared to year-over-year increases of 7.2% and 7.5% for July and August, respectively. Our revenue per day also increased at an accelerated pace in September. Our revenue growth had trended between 11% to 11.5% from the beginning of the quarter until mid-September, but we experienced a material increase in business for those last few weeks of the month. This accelerated pace of year-over-year growth has continued thus far into October with month-to-date revenue increasing between 27.5% and 18% with a 13.9% increase in LTL tons per day. Our third quarter operating ratio improved 120 basis points to 81.2% with improvement in both variable operating cost and our overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Salary, wages and benefit costs as a percent of revenue improved 140 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2016, although we were required to increase our utilization and purchase transportation and keep pace with the 6.7% increase in shipments per day. Stated in our release this morning, we intend to hire additional employees in the fourth quarter in anticipation of continued growth. We can\u2019t say this enough, but we have been extremely pleased with the efforts of our team members to manage our volume growth while also maintaining superior service and high levels of productivity. Old Dominion\u2019s cash flow from operations totaled $149.5 million for the third quarter and $388 million for the first 9 months of 2017. Capital expenditures were $100.5 million for the quarter and $288.8 million for the first nine months of 2017. We expect total capital expenditures of approximately $400 million for the year, subject to the timing on certain real estate projects; returned $9.1 million of capital to our shareholders during the third quarter and $32.7 million for the first 9 months of the year. We have $192 million still available for stock repurchases under our current $250 million stock repurchase program. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 37.8% as compared to 37.2% for the third quarter of 2016. Our annual effective tax rate changed during the quarter as a result of favorable discrete tax items. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be 38.3% for the fourth quarter of 2017. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we\u2019ll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Brad Delco with Stephens Inc. Brad Delco : Good morning overall David and Adam. David Congdon : Hi Brad. Brad Delco : I wanted to, I guess, touch on that October number first, Adam. And maybe this question is for Dave. 13.9% seems like a big number. Dave, how do you think about taking that much market share relative to price? I know you get the question a lot of how you manage tonnage and yield, but is that too much tonnage, you think, for the network to handle? Or do you think you should get more aggressive on price? Just big picture, how should we be thinking about that? David Congdon : Yes. We \u2013 as we\u2019ve said in the past, we don\u2019t turn the price/volume knob, one way or the other, to try to raise prices to slow down tonnage or to lower prices to raise tonnage. We have to be consistent with being fair and equitable with our customers on price, so we\u2019re just honestly winning market share because of our superior service right now. And we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve gotten ourselves geared up. You can see in the release that I think our total full- time employee count was up, what was it, Adam, over \u2013 nearly 1,000 in the last year, maybe 74.4% we geared ourselves up enough to handle through the peak of this fall season and maintained our 99% on-time service. It\u2019s been a challenge, but we\u2019ve done it. And we\u2019re \u2013 as we stated in the release and mentioned just earlier, we still \u2013 we continue to have some open positions within the company that we are filling in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s not a huge number of people, but we\u2019re getting geared up to get ready for the first quarter of next year. And we want to bring on folks and put them through our driving schools and make sure we\u2019ve got ample number of drivers to get us into the first quarter next year. Brad Delco : Great. And then maybe one quick follow- up. When we think about sequential margins, I guess, to some degree, you cautioned folks about meeting the ramp for hires in the third quarter. In addition, we had a lot of hurricane noise that you guys didn\u2019t call out. So how should we read the commentary on ramping employees further in fourth quarter? Should it change sequential \u2013 historical sequential trends in margins, you think, from 3Q to 4Q? Adam Satterfield : Brad, it\u2019s hard to say. Obviously in the third quarter and I think going back to last call, we talked about \u2013 we felt like with the hiring that we might not achieve the normal 50 basis point increase from the second to third quarter. And a lot of what we saw with that acceleration of revenue to finish out the quarter, I think that really helped us leverage some of our fixed costs that were in the system and end up with only a 30 basis point increase. Normally, we go from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, it\u2019s about a 200 basis point increase in our operating ratio. As David mentioned, normally we\u2019re not \u2013 our headcount is typically set as we\u2019re working through the peak and going into the fourth quarter, but we still probably got about 500 positions that we think will add, too. So it will be a little out of the norm that we\u2019re adding headcount in the fourth quarter. And really, it\u2019s going to be dependent upon where volumes do. We\u2019re well ahead of what normal seasonality would be from a revenue and weight standpoint, so we\u2019ll just see how the market share continues to come into us and just manage to those levels. Brad Delco : Great. Thanks for time and I will be back into you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Chris Wetherbee : Hi, thanks. Good morning guys. I want to come back to the hurricanes, just weather generally. I don\u2019t know if you can put some parameters around what maybe some of those disruptions look like from an expense perspective on a network, but any color you could give on that would be helpful. Adam Satterfield : Chris, this is Adam. We \u2013 honestly, we\u2019ve managed to it. We had a plan before the hurricanes. I think we talked about the fact that Harvey hit in our Gulf Coast region, and our Gulf Coast area is not as big of a percent of our overall revenue as the Southeast is. And that just goes back to where we got our start. The Southeast, in general, is about 25% of our total revenue. But certainly, there were costs that we incurred related to repositioning and equipment and doing some other things to prepare for the storms and probably some inefficiencies within our line haul network that we incurred as well and get things geared up and being network that we incurred as well and get things geared up and being able to get back to service on expedited basis and making deliveries and pickups when our customers were ready for those. And certainly, we incurred some of those costs that was a little bit of an impact on revenue as well. And certainly, we saw that in the middle part of September, those \u2013 about 4, 5 days of impact when the Southeast was \u2013 and we had some terminals closed and so forth, but that\u2019s when we get to that latter part of the month. I think that our ability to restore our operations, get back on track and the lack of reliance of purchase transportation within our network and being able to manage our freight with best-in-class service, we think is \u2013 was a big driver in that acceleration in our revenue growth for those last few weeks of the month. And that\u2019s continued to date, thus far, into October. Chris Wetherbee : That\u2019s great. That\u2019s really helpful. And just sort of picking up on that, when you think about the pickup into October, I don\u2019t know if you can sort of break this out. But do you think that this is sort of pent-up demand that\u2019s now coming to your network because of some of these disruptions? Do you feel like this is sort of pre-peak season type of inventory restocking that\u2019s going on? I know there\u2019s clearly some market share dynamics underneath all of that, but I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of maybe how you guys are reading the demand environment into the fourth quarter. David Congdon : Chris, this is David. I was studying our regional register this morning. We break our company internally into 10 regions. October is solid, really solid growth everywhere. And it is especially interesting that the hurricane hit Southern and Gulf Coast regions have the highest rates of growth among all 10 regions, and they are right in the middle of the pack in terms of being the fourth- and fifth-largest regions. So it\u2019s not a high growth rate on a low denominator. It\u2019s a high growth rate on a high denominator, and I\u2019m talking about outbound revenue in particular. But \u2013 so we\u2019re just \u2013 our story has been every time we have one of these calls, we see good growth across the whole company. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. David Congdon : Okay. Chris Wetherbee : That\u2019s really helpful. David Congdon : And we turned over to our next question. Thankyou. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. David Congdon : Thanks operator good job with that last name. Amit Mehrotra : Hey guys, good morning congrats on a good quarter. So I just wanted to follow-up on the last question a little bit, maybe differently. So obviously, the businesses is firing on all cylinders in terms of, I guess, the most recent data points at least. Can you just talk about maybe the drivers of the recent surge? You talked about sort of broad- based growth but also wondering if you\u2019re actually seeing any spillover volumes from maybe traditional truckload freight this early? Or is that maybe some potential further growth divers next year? Any thoughts there and what you\u2019re seeing. Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Certainly, we think that there was tightness in the industry in general, and I think that it\u2019s been documented that the truckload environment is tightening, and perhaps, there is a little bit of some spillover freight that\u2019s coming back into LTL. Some of that may have been freight that moved from LTL into the truckload last year. We did have a big increase in our weight per shipment in September. In fact, our shipment count growth, pretty much, it was slightly ahead of normal seasonality. But the weight per shipment was really what drove that weight growth above normal seasonality. And we actually had, from August into September, about a 4% increase in weight per shipment. And so some of that \u2013 our weight per shipment increased to 1,620 pounds in September, and that\u2019s getting back to \u2013 closer to some of the levels that we saw in 2014. So whether or not we\u2019re getting a little bit of spillover, I can tell you it\u2019s not in volume quotes, the spot quotes that we\u2019re getting in. We\u2019re not seeing an acceleration there. We\u2019re actually controlling that freight through rate, and we can change the rate from spot quote business every day. And so we\u2019re wanting to make sure that we protect our consistent, long-term LTL business and not taking any transactional type of heavy-volume shipments that may be disruptive to service. But as David mentioned, we\u2019re seeing good growth across all regions. I think it\u2019s balanced. And certainly, most of our business is tied to industrial end markets. We\u2019re seeing good growth in the Midwestern regions, really through the middle of the country, I think. And that would be supportive of the industrial growth that we\u2019re seeing. And when we look and sort of break down the revenue, I think it\u2019s coming pretty balanced from industrial and retail-related type of counts but probably geared a little bit more to industrial than anything. And I think when you look at some of the macroeconomic numbers, that would be supported. But we\u2019ve long told the story that it takes service, price and capacity to gain market share. And certainly, we continue to deliver best-in-class service at a fair price. We\u2019ve got network capacity. And maybe while others are seeing some tightness, we\u2019re able to win some market share. So those three elements are working together in perfect harmony right now and singing a beautiful song. Amit Mehrotra : Can I just ask one follow-up? Sorry. That caught me offguard. Just one follow-up on pricing or to actually more, Adam, related to your incremental margin discussions. In the past, you\u2019ve really talked about sort of straddling 20% to 30% incremental margins, and that could be at the high end early on and kind of melt down. But given this kind of surge in the mix of the business maybe moving towards more heavier shipments which obviously accretive to the network, do you think \u2013 I know you\u2019re adding some people in the fourth quarter. Do you think that you can stay at this higher level of incremental margins for longer given what you\u2019re seeing on the demand side? Or do you think we should expect kind of a melting towards that midpoint of that range as we move out into next year? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I honestly thought that the incrementals at 29%, I thought they were very good for the quarter. I expected it to honestly be a little bit lower, but we had such strong revenue growth, particularly there in September. So that came in favorably for us. But when I look at our revenue per shipment, as you mentioned, the weight per shipment, that\u2019s driving increased revenue per shipment. When I look at our cost on a per-shipment basis, we probably experienced a little bit more cost inflation than what I was originally anticipating. And some of that is \u2013 and we talked about it last quarter when you\u2019re bringing on new employees and also when you\u2019re dealing with these high volumes of growth and above, maybe what you are initially expecting, it can create a little bit of inefficiencies. And we will have some dock efficiencies during the quarter, and that\u2019s fairly typical when you\u2019re bringing in new employees. So we\u2019ll continue to stay focused on looking at driving some productivity improvements in the fourth quarter. We see the normal, seasonal kind of slowdown that will allow us to get our employees in and get them trained and so forth, but the reality is, is we\u2019re not seeing any slowdown at this point. So they just keep at it, managing the freight, and the focus is on continuing to deliver best-in-class service. So obviously, it\u2019s been nice to see the incremental margins staying at this 30% range, and we\u2019ll stay focused on doing the best we can to controlling our costs and managing good quality revenue and putting it to the bottom line. Amit Mehrotra : Okay, thanks Adam. Thanks everyone congrats on good quarter and appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Thanks and good morning everyone. Not to belabor the point about the post hurricane strength, but it makes sense that historically you guys would have kind of gained share during force majeure events like this that caused shippers to focus on service more than price. I\u2019m just wondering, historically, if you kind of go back to a similar situation, just how long that halo has lasted before it\u2019s normalized? And do you think that this is a similar normal environment? Or do you think with the impact of ELDs, it\u2019s going to continue for a while? Adam Satterfield : That\u2019s probably the million-dollar question. Certainly, we\u2019ve been through periods like this in the past, and I think it\u2019s beneficial for us and we keep repeating it, but having ultimate control of all aspects of our operations and primarily controlling our own destiny with managing our internal line haul. We\u2019re not subject to changes in other environment and whether truckload capacity tightening and increasing in rate is having an impact on our competitors that maybe make use of increased reliance on purchase transportation for their line haul network. Certainly that\u2019s a contributing factor. We\u2019ve talked about our long-term and historical investments in network capacity, so we feel good there. And we\u2019re going to continue to invest. We keep this element of capacity about 25% on average in our service and our network to make sure that\u2019s not a limiting factor to our growth. And when we see periods like what we\u2019ve been going through, and it\u2019s somewhat similar to the issues we went through back in 2014 where volume comes to us at an accelerated pace, and we continue to be able to handle it. But that\u2019s why we got to keep a focus on the threee elements : the capacity, the service and our network. We continue to invest and maintain that access there on the equipment side. We had to make some operational changes. We had equipment that was destined to be sold off this year, and we\u2019ve kept that in the fleet to be able to accommodate the growth. And then finally, you\u2019ve got the people capacity. And certainly, going back to last quarter, when we started seeing some acceleration there, we got on board with trying to hire and bring in good quality drivers, get drivers though our training program and get them in place. And we dealt with the accelerated growth to the third quarter, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to continue to stay focused on to make sure that our workforce is in position for 2018. Ravi Shanker : That\u2019s helpful. But if you also kind of expand that to your characterization of the broader competitor environment right now, especially in Northeast. Given the tight environment, kind of is it in pretty good shape? Adam Satterfield : Are Northeast in good shape? Ravi Shanker : Just broad competitor environment, especially the Northeast, yes. David Congdon : I think we\u2019re one of the best carries in existence that serves the Northeast. It is one of our \u2013 it is, in fact, our largest region by revenue, and we are certainly not being impacted by any of the new entrants into that market. Ravi Shanker : Very helpful. And just lastly, we are seeing a number of new electric trucks being launched with something like 100 or 200 miles of range. I think Daimler just showed us a heavy-duty version of electric truck, and Tesla is supposed to launch something else soon. Before these heavy-duty EV trucks become long-distance line haul trucks, do you see potential to use them for pickup and delivery operations? David Congdon : I would say we will wait and see on that whole thing. Until we see something concrete, improvement in the marketplace, we\u2019re not going to be an early adopter of electric trucks. Ravi Shanker : Thank you Operator : And our next question comes from Matthew Brooklier from Buckingham Research Group. Matthew Brooklier : Thanks and good morning. Adam, I think you talked to it little bit, but I\u2019m going to ask the question anyways. Where do you think you are right now from a capacity utilization perspective? Maybe talk to potential areas where you may have to add, either on the service center side or the equipment side. I guess my question is how full is the network right now? And how much more freight could you handle over the next 12 months? David Congdon : Matt, this is David. As far as equipment and people capacity, I would say we were pretty big and strong in the third quarter, and we\u2019re strong with business levels in October, and we\u2019re damn near 100% there. In the last week of September, we were 110% capacity, I think, on that \u2013 in that regard. But \u2013 so we\u2019re tying. And this is why we have said we\u2019re hiring people and we\u2019re getting our equipment orders in for next year to be able to build up our equipment capacity. But our network, as Adam stated earlier, we maintain 20% to 25% excess capacity in the network with our doors and yard space, et cetera. And that\u2019s what we try to do. Adam Satterfield : We\u2019re going through \u2013 just to add to that, Matt. We\u2019re going through and getting ready to go through a process for looking and developing our CapEx plan for next year. And as we always do, we look at the service centers that may have more door pressure than others. And we try to stay a couple of years out ahead of a growth curve, anticipated growth curve. And \u2013 but those service centers will be the ones that we begin addressing early into next year when we develop that plan. Matthew Brooklier : Okay. Good problem to have here. And then maybe, I think historically, you\u2019ve pushed through a wage increase to your Employees. I\u2019m just curious to hear if that was the case this September? And if you\u2019re able to talk to the magnitude of the pay increase. Adam Satterfield : Yes. We gave basically an average increase of 3% the 1st of September. But typically, we give our increases beginning of September every year. Matthew Brooklier : Okay appreciate the time. Operator : And our next question comes from Todd Fowler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Fowler : Great, thank good morning. Just on the comments on the headcount. With the anticipated growth in the fourth quarter, is that continuing to kind of chase where shipments are and getting staffed up with where your shipment levels currently are? And then how do we think about what your planning would be as you go into next year, how you think about what you\u2019d anticipate from growth and what you\u2019d be on a headcount standpoint, which slowed down a little bit in the first quarter to get some efficiencies? Or do you continue to ramp the headcount as we move into the first part of \u201818? Adam Satterfield : The positions that we need to add are a little bit of both. We\u2019re still trailing a little bit with our increase in headcount. We were up 4.4% versus the 6.7% increase in shipments per day, and that was average. If you look at where we finished the quarter, at the end of September, we are probably at about 5.5% over September of last year. So we\u2019ve added 762 positions during the third quarter. And as I mentioned, we probably got about another 500 to add. We want to get ourselves into a good spot, one, to manage the freight levels that we have today. We\u2019re making a little bit of use of purchase transposition in our line haul network that I mentioned in my prepared comments, and we\u2019d like to eliminate that if we can and continue to have the freight ourselves with our people and our equipment. And then just \u2013 we\u2019ll take it day by day as we go through next year. We generally put the hiring decisions to the local service center manager level. They know what their freight opportunities and their individual markets will be and how they need to staff. And as we start building out forecast and our sales personnel are out polling their customers and looking at what their opportunities into 2018 will be, that\u2019s essentially how we\u2019ll manage our staffing plan. Todd Fowler : And, Adam, is it a labor availability standpoint? Or is it just the fact that the business has been growing so quickly that makes it difficult to be caught up with where the shipment count is? Adam Satterfield : When we came into this year, we had some \u2013 we were cautiously optimistic about what the trends are going to be. And remember, coming off of last year and even in the first quarter, we were seeing pretty modest revenue growth. And so we\u2019ve been playing a little bit of catch-up all year as we\u2019ve made our way through. And we get a \u2013 on the driver side, we get a pretty nice balance of bringing in experienced tires. And then we\u2019re also using our driver training program to get people through, and that obviously takes time, bringing someone in that can hit the streets immediately. But certainly, we want to make sure that we\u2019re bringing the right people on board that live and breathe the OD family spirit and buy into our culture and really want to be out and have the head and the heart connected, as David said, to deliver best-in- class service. We\u2019ve probably got a few spots around the country where it may be a little bit tighter than others, finding some drivers, but I think we give a \u2013 we\u2019ve got a great wage and benefits package. I mentioned the 3% wage increase. We\u2019ve also made some improvements to our benefits package that I think will help us, not only retain our existing employees, but attract new employees as well employees as well. So we\u2019re going to keep pushing and making sure that we\u2019re appropriately staffed to deal with the volume growth. Todd Fowler : Okay. Just a quick follow-up. For the working days in the fourth quarter, how do you think about the timing of the holidays? And I know you guys are usually pretty good about not saying or not adjusting for holidays. But when you compare it to the fourth quarter of last year with Christmas on a \u2013 I think it\u2019s a Monday this year, is there \u2013 should we think about on an OR progression again, maybe some impact from when the holidays fall this year? Adam Satterfield : I don\u2019t know. I mean, the last day of the month this year is a Friday, and that\u2019s Friday the 29th. Last year was Friday the 30th. We don\u2019t make too much \u2013 I mean, this year, I think when you look at how the days fell, the end of the quarter have probably been a little bit stronger because they\u2019ve generally been a Friday. But we don\u2019t make too much, heads or tails, of that for our quarter and for an annual perspective, to be honest. Todd Fowler : Okay, yes understood okay thanks lot for the time nice quarter today. Operator : Our next question comes from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Allison Landry : Good morning thanks for taking my question. So maybe just to switch gears a little to the topic of e-commerce. Of course, we all know that Amazon continues to build out their fulfillment centers, et cetera. But I think we\u2019ve seen a rapid shift from the sort of large brick and mortars that at least appear to have successful online strategies, basically building out various ways to compete with Amazon, whether that\u2019s shifting stores into distribution centers or new facilities located next to a FedEx, for example. Are you guys seeing any of that play out sort of in the marketplace? And is that something that you see impacting LTL and whether it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t know, near term seems probably a little too short term to think about but midterm or long term. And then maybe if you could comment on the news that came out a couple of weeks ago that Amazon\u2019s basically taking over the logistics of some of their third-party sellers at \u2013 starting at the warehouse. Is that an opportunity for LTL? David Congdon : Well, couple of things, Allison. The \u2013 first of all, we deliver to homes now. We have liftgate equipment in all of our service centers. And it\u2019s not a big part of our business, home deliveries, but \u2013 so we do that, and we see maybe a little uptick in that kind of business. But the \u2013 serving these multiple fulfillment centers across the country, as companies have gone from large distribution centers to multiple fulfillment centers, we think that, that shifts business from truckload to LTL. And if those fulfillment centers want to turn their inventory rapidly, they need an accurate, fast, claim-free LTL service into their fulfillment centers. And we believe that, that plays into our hands very well. So to that degree, we should do well and do a good service to the e-tailers. As far as what you mentioned about Amazon taking over their logistics, I don\u2019t have any \u2013 their statistics providers. I don\u2019t really have any comment on that. Allison Landry : Okay. Are you seeing any retailers approach you for any sort of collaborative initiatives or anything like that? Adam Satterfield : We have. I mean, obviously, we manage retail business. And many retailers are struggling with their own kind of e-commerce product and delivery, but David Congdon : Nothing in big way. Adam Satterfield : That\u2019s right. Allison Landry : Okay. I guess I\u2019m not sure if I missed this, so I apologize. But did you guys provide the monthly tonnage and yield numbers for the quarter? Adam Satterfield : You want the monthly, like, sequential or year-over-year? Allison Landry : Either. For tonnage or ton per day and yield. Adam Satterfield : Yes. The tons per day was up 7.2% in July, and that\u2019s on a year-over-year basis; up 7.5% for August and up 11.3% for September. Allison Landry : And the sequential. Adam Satterfield : The sequential, July was down 2.7%, and that compares to the 10-year average being a negative 2.1%. In August, it was plus 0.2% versus the long- term average of being 0.6%. And then September, that was what we talked about. It was up 7.3%, and the long-term average is a positive 2.8%. We had that material increase in weight per shipment. And when you look at shipments, and I think I mentioned this before, shipments were pretty much in line with what normal seasonality was for the most part for the quarter. It was just that big step-up in weight per shipment that drove that weight change. Allison Landry : Okay got it, excellent thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from David Ross from Stifel. David Ross : Not too much to ask here because [indiscernible] OR, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re making any bad decision on pricing or market share gains. But when customers do come to you with extra freight noncontract business, maybe truckload in a tight environment, and they want it moved, what\u2019s the process? How do you deal with existing customers that might just have a little bit more freight to give you versus new customers that don\u2019t use Old Dominion in terms of managing the potential inflow to what you allow into your network? Adam Satterfield : Dave, it\u2019s really on a case-by-case basis is how we manage it. And we always talk about LTL\u2019s relationship business. And so we look at the account that have been good long-term accounts. And if they\u2019re struggling to find capacity in some ways, we look and see how we can help them and manage their supply chains and provide any measure of capacity that we can. But certainly, we want to make sure that we\u2019re doing it in the right way and not jeopardizing the service or any other good accounts. And some of that, it varies. It\u2019s accounts that we\u2019ve got contracts with, and we see some fluctuation. And we\u2019re seeing a little fluctuation with the 3PL managed business as well. And I think that in the 3PL world, last year, that was some of the business where we saw some decreases in weight per shipment. And perhaps where the truckload environment was a little looser, they were able to find some truckload carriers that were willing to take smaller shipments or do some multi-stops. Whereas this year, some of that freight is coming back to us. But it\u2019s all \u2013 it\u2019s like anything, it\u2019s a case by case and the relationship that we have with the customer and doing everything in the right way. David Ross : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Seidl from Cowen. Jason Seidl : Real quickly guys. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve covered this. But where is contractual pricing for you in the quarter? And where do you see it going given the tightness in the truckload marketplace? Adam Satterfield : We still target \u2013 that, too, is account by account, but we still target the 3% to 4% increases. And going back to David\u2019s commentary, when you go back to 2000 and our revenue per hundredweight, excluding the fuel, has averaged a little over a 3% increase. And so our price and philosophy is we want to be fair and consistent with our customers. And certainly, we\u2019ve got OR objectives that we look at and buy accounts, and that\u2019s how we manage and that\u2019s what our pricing philosophy is. We\u2019re not going to [indiscernible] manage what the current marketplace is. When we\u2019ve got certain accounts that are operating, we just continue to focus on getting those consistent increases that we need, but we do the same thing when markets are on the flip side. And so that\u2019s where \u2013 if you got a good relationship, accounts are willing to give you the increases that you need to invest in the capacity and the information technology tools that they\u2019re demanding from us. So we\u2019ve got to continue to invest and we\u2019ll all go up front and we need an appropriate yield to do so. Jason Seidl : Given your \u2013 given quarters like this, I doubt people will argue with your pricing philosophy. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research Scott : So, Adam, did you give the weight per shipment increase for the \u2013 for October? And did you give revenue per hundredweight, ex fuel, for October? Adam Satterfield : I didn\u2019t give any yield for October. And we\u2019ve talked about trying not to really focus on the monthly yield metrics. I think it\u2019s just drilling down too closely. But for October, I said that our revenue is trending up month to date between 17.5% and 18%, and actual LTL weight per day is up 13.9%. So you can kind of back into what the yield is to get you there. But I guess if I had to make clear that when you\u2019ve got changes in weight per shipment and length of haul and so forth, and that\u2019s kind of what we saw. I mean, we gave our mid-quarter update and what our yield was at that point. And you can see that, that compressed a bit as we finish the third quarter, but we\u2019re still putting good incremental margins up, I think. And it\u2019s all about managing the operating ratio. We had significant increases in revenue, especially with some customer accounts. And it\u2019s taken on freight and locations. And as mix changes, the revenue per hundredweight is going to change. Scott: Okay. And what\u2019s weight per shipment up in October? Adam Satterfield : Weight per shipment 2.5%. Scott: Okay. And did you see that continue to increase sequentially from September to October? Adam Satterfield : Decreased a little bit. I mentioned that we were at 1,620 pounds basically in September, so it\u2019s pulled back a little bit. And typically, it\u2019s a little flattish normally when people get September and October\u2019s weight per shipment. But the way it increased so much there is basically to finish out the month, it wasn\u2019t surprising to see it pull back a little bit. We were still averaging in July and August. I mean, our weight per shipment was still about 1,560, which we\u2019ve been in this 1,550, 1,560 pound kind of weight range for sometime. So that increase above 1,620 pounds is a nice thing to see, and we\u2019ll see how long that it stays there. Scott: Okay, helpful. Is there a good rule of thumb for how much 1 less operating day costs you on margin in the quarter? Adam Satterfield : I mean, when you think about our revenue per day and kind of what \u2013 how that\u2019s trending, typically we talked about when you break our operating ratio down 60% to 65%, closer to 60% these days with the operating ratio at an 81% is variable operating cost. So you can kind of use those metrics to figure out what that contribution margin of the 1 extra or 1 less day would be. Scott: Okay. And then just last question, I want to go back to that question about the truckload pricing environment getting better. I understand your philosophy is not changing, but do you think the broader LTL pricing environment should accelerate from here because the truckload pricing environment is getting better? Or do you think maybe that doesn\u2019t apply right now because LTL pricing didn\u2019t turn negative when truckload pricing turned negative the past couple of years? Adam Satterfield : We\u2019ve long said that I think industry pricing needs to increase, and I think that we\u2019re starting to see a little bit of that this year. And we\u2019ll see \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s some of the feedback that we\u2019re getting from customers is that they\u2019re experiencing increases with other accounts. And so that\u2019s opening up a bid process. But when you look at industry margins and where they are, I think one of the easiest ways to improve margins would be for the other carriers to increase their rates. market continue to increase. Scott: Okay. But your thought is if industry pricing accelerates and other carriers raise pricing more, we\u2019ll stick with 3% to 4%, but that\u2019s when we\u2019ll get even more share. Adam Satterfield : That has been the formula that we\u2019ve used for many years. Scott: Perfect Okay. Thank you guys appreciated. Operator : Our next question comes from Ariel Rosa from Bank of America. Ariel Rosa : Hey, good morning guys nice quarter. I wanted to start. First question, just if you could give us an update on what the fleet age looks like and any equipment sales during the quarter and just your views broadly on the status of the used truck market. Adam Satterfield : The fleet age, we finished last year at 4.5 years, and we don\u2019t necessarily update it as we go through the year. But I had anticipated that our fleet age would get younger. As I mentioned before, though, with the growth that we\u2019ve had this year, some of the equipment that we were planning to sell, we\u2019ve had to keep in operations. Now a lot of the equipment, I think we mentioned that while we entered this year, our CapEx was primarily for replacement equipment, but we were going to take out multiple years of the pre-\u201907 engine changes where we are experiencing some increased cost, operating cost per mile. So we\u2019ve kept those units in the fleet. We\u2019re continuing to operate them, and we\u2019ll evaluate our fleet as we go through and putting in our orders, as David mentioned, for next year, looking at what our replacement needs will be and what are growth. But we would like to get some of those older units out of the fleet. And in regards to used truck market, we don\u2019t have really a big exposure there. We use our equipment 9, 10 years, and so they\u2019re really at scrap value when we\u2019re trying to dispose of those older units. Ariel Rosa : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I just \u2013 I wanted to ask, I guess, a little bit more of a philosophical question. Looking at the cyclicality in your business, it seems like \u2013 so if 2016 ends up being kind of a trough year, it will have been far more benign than other years and certainly a lot more benign than what other carriers experienced. Do you think is that something that you guys can maintain? Have you found a way to kind of operate where you\u2019ve kind of mitigated the impact of cyclical downturns? Or is that \u2013 or was it just kind of 2016 was a one-off because of some favorable moves that you guys made or some other factor? David Congdon : Not quite sure what you\u2019re getting at. But we operate through cycles. And we have a real good control, good measurement systems and good control on our costs, managing down-cycles. We think we did pretty darn well last year, considering how flat the year was. But it\u2019s all about staying true to your core business, principles and processes through strong periods and weak periods and do the best you can when the going gets tough. Ariel Rosa : Yes, Well, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth following up on that. I actually was agreeing with you there, David, that I think you guys did manage exceptionally well through the downturn. I\u2019m wondering if maybe what kind of the balances between fixed cost versus variable cost and your ability. To extent that there are future downturns in the cycle, do you think those are going to be more benign or the downturn for you guys might be \u2013 the effect of that downturn might be more mitigated than was been in the past? David Congdon : I think it\u2019s mostly mitigated by a low 80s operating ratio. We can withstand a cyclical downturn a whole lot better than anyone else. Ariel Rosa : Okay. That\u2019s all for thank you. Operator : And it appears there are no further are questions. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Earl Congdon for closing for closing remarks. Earl Congdon : Well, we thank you all for your participation today, and we appreciate your questions. You had some great ones. And please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. So thanks again, and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to the company's Executive Chairman, Mr. Earl Congdon. Please go ahead, sir. Earl Congdon : Good morning, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter Conference Call. With me on the call today is David Congdon, our Vice Chairman and CEO; and Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion had an outstanding fourth quarter to complete a very strong year of profitable growth. Building on the accelerated growth that began in September, we produced revenue growth of 19.5% for the fourth quarter. This growth rate is the strongest we have had since the fourth quarter of 2014, and the overall environment feels about as positive as I can remember.  Given the favorable environment, we continue to believe that Old Dominion is uniquely positioned to win market share in 2018. We can do this by remaining fully committed to the core business strategies that put us in our unique position, which include providing superior service at a fair price, investing in the success of our employees and continuously investing in equipment and service center capacity to support our growth initiatives. The disciplined execution of these strategies for more than two decades has created a long-term record of profitable growth, which continues to validate our business approach and differentiates us from our competition. Our success also reflects the strengths of the Old Dominion team. We again recognize and thank each team members who has been responsible for continuously improving all aspects of our business. Thanks for being with us this morning, and now, here is David Congdon to discuss the fourth quarter in greater detail. David Congdon : Thanks, Earl, and good morning. I will begin by adding my thanks and recognition to all of our OD family of employees for their contributions to our success in 2017. We grew our team this year by adding 1,640 new full-time employees. Of this total, we hired approximately 1,400 in the second half of the year as our volumes accelerated. These additions have increased the capacity of our employee base and has prepared us well for 2018.  I'll also add that I couldn't be more proud of our team's performance this past year. We operated with great efficiency in handling our growth, but most importantly, we maintained our superior service standards and won the Mastio Quality Award for the eighth straight year. This may sound like a broken record at times, but we believe that our ability to consistently deliver superior service at a fair but equitable price has been critical for our long-term profitable growth. There are, of course, many other ingredients in our formula for success, including the consistent and long-term investments in capacity to ensure that our network is not a limiting factor to our growth.  We reported to you about a year ago that we were feeling cautiously optimistic for 2017 based on customer conversations and improving macroeconomic trend. I don't know, however, that any of us anticipated that our revenue would be growing at a 19.5% rate to close out the year. Our revenue growth in the fourth quarter included improvements in both density and yield, which generated operating leverage that allowed us to improve our operating ratio by 90 basis points to 83.9%. LTL tons per day increased to 14.4% for the fourth quarter, which was our first double-digit increase in 11 quarters, and the pricing environment continued to be favorable. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 5.1% and increased 3.1% when excluding fuel surcharges.  The increase in our yield is consistent with our core pricing philosophy that focuses on obtaining price increases necessary to address individual account profitability and offset the company's cost inflation. We believe that industry conditions will continue to support a favorable pricing environment during 2018, which could support additional market share growth during the year. The 2018 budget for capital expenditures reflects our expectations for continued growth, as well as our ongoing commitment to giving our employees everything they need to succeed, whether it be investment in their continued education and training or in efficiency and productivity-enhancing technology. In summary, Old Dominion completed 2017 with substantial profitable growth with the fourth quarter including more actual revenue growth than we have ever achieved before. We're carrying a lot of momentum into 2018. We feel like domestic economy is in great shape. We are confident that the company is well positioned to leverage this momentum through disciplined execution of our proven business model, which we expect will produce additional gains in market share, earnings and shareholder value. Thanks for your time this morning, and now, Adam Satterfield will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, David, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue grew 19.5% in the fourth quarter to $891.1 million, which is the highest quarterly revenue we have ever recorded. Fourth quarter included $13.9 million of non-LTL revenue. Our operating ratio improved 90 basis points to 83.9%, and our income before tax increased 29.2%. Earnings per diluted share increased 188% to $2.39 for the quarter.  As we noted in our release this morning, a couple of items related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act impacted these fourth quarter results. These include a special bonus paid for our nonexecutive employees of $9.8 million and the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability that resulted in a net tax benefit of $104.9 million. Our revenue growth for the fourth quarter once again included increases in LTL tonnage and yield. LTL tons per day increased 14.4% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 with LTL shipments per day increasing 11.4% and LTL weight per shipment increasing 2.7%. Trend for both LTL tons per day and LTL shipments per day were well above normal seasonality for the fourth quarter. LTL tons per day increased 2.6% when compared to the third quarter of 2017. This was the first time since 2005 that our fourth quarter tonnage exceeded the third quarter in the same year. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the fourth quarter were as follows, October decreased 2.5% as compared with September; November increased 4.3% versus October; and December decreased 7.6% as compared to November. The 10-year average change for the respective months are a decrease of 3.6% in October, an increase of 3.2% in November and a decrease of 9.3% in December. On our last earnings calls, we discussed how our year-over-year revenue growth accelerated in September, and we are pleased to report that accelerated pace of growth continued throughout the fourth quarter. The improvement in the domestic economy contribute to our growth throughout 2017, but we believe our recent growth rates reflect the inherent opportunities of our business model that we have so often discussed. Update you on our first quarter of 2018 trends, our revenue per day increased approximately 19.5% on a year-over-year basis and LTL tons per day increased 14.4% for January.  Operating ratio for the fourth quarter improved 90 basis points to 83.9% with improvement in both our variable operating cost and overhead expenses as a percent of revenue. Salaries wages and benefit cost as a percent of revenue improved 190 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 despite the impact of the employee special bonus. We will remain focused on matching our labor capacity with growth in LTL shipments during 2018, and we would expect to see changes in our headcount and volumes trend closer together as they historically have. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $148.3 million for the fourth quarter and $536.3 million for 2017. Capital expenditures were $93.3 million for the quarter and $382.1 million for the year.  Based on our anticipated growth for 2018 and the execution of our normal replacement cycle, we expect total capital expenditures of $510 million for 2018. This total includes approximately $200 million for real estate and service center expansion projects, which should increase our service center network to 235 to 240 facilities by the end of the year. We returned $8.2 million of capital to shareholders during the fourth quarter and a total of $40.9 million for the year. Today, we announced that our quarterly dividend will increase 30% to $0.13 per share in the first quarter. This increase was higher than what we originally anticipated prior to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but allows us to maintain a similar dividend payout ratio. Annual effective tax rate for 2017 was positively impacted by the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability as well as other favorable discrete tax items. We currently anticipate an annual effective tax rate of 26.5% for 2018 as a result of the changes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This rate is subject to change, however, as clarifying guidance becomes available.  This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor at this time for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will go first to Brad Delco with Stephens. Albert Delco : David or Adam, I mean, you guys have historically always given us guidance on incremental margins of, call it, 20%. You guys keep moving your OR lower. Any chance you can update us on what you think incremental margins can look like? Because, Adam, I heard your comments about the employee count kind of increasing at a similar rate to your tonnage. I'm just trying to figure out where we're going to get the -- where we're going to get leverage in 2018 in this great environment. Adam Satterfield : Yes. Thanks, Brad. If you go back to 2010, our incrementals have averaged about 25%, and that's probably the rate that we're most closely tracking towards. And there may be some periods where it's a little bit lower, and so the 20%, 20% to 25% is probably more likely range. And it can vary, obviously. In periods of higher growth, it becomes a little bit harder to -- just from the mathematics of the equation. But certainly, we're always focused on putting as much money to the bottom line as we can. And I think we did a nice job of that as we progress through this past year and does -- as the environment was accelerating for us, I think the last few quarters were pretty nice, beginning with really just starting with an incremental margin in the first quarter and then that accelerating. But I think we talked a little bit about in the back half of the year that we're playing catch up a little bit with hiring. And I thought that the hiring that we had planned to do in the fourth quarter to get our employee base where it needed to be might be a bit of a headwind. But we just had such strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter that, that helped us put more of that revenue growth to the bottom line. So we felt like fourth quarter was a great quarter in the sense of the growth and what our bottom line performance was as well. David Congdon : And Brad, I'll add to that and say that the -- our revenue and cost structure is a pretty healthy mix, I'd say. And as we've said in the past, when we can put additional density across the network with a good yield environment and a decent economy, that our operating margins can continue to improve. I think that showed up very well in the fourth quarter, and we believe that the economy and our ability to win market share in 2018 is there. The pricing environment is good. So we should see adequate incremental margins to continue to be able to improve our operating ratio. Albert Delco : Great. And then maybe one quick follow-up. I mean, everyone tends to always think about you guys having latent capacity in your network because of all the investments you make. Can you just quickly give us an update on where you think your incremental capacity is now with your fleet and with your real estate and with your employee base? Adam Satterfield : In the network, which that's probably the most important, our service center network, we try to keep about 25% capacity. Given the acceleration and the growth, that's probably maybe now down closer to 20%. We usually say 20% to 25%. It may be 15% to 20%. But I think we executed a lot of good projects last year, and we've got a good plan for this year. And as David mentioned, we always want to make sure that we stay well ahead of our anticipated growth curve, so that the network is not a limiting factor to our growth. And I think we made good progress of getting our employee base positioned well. And we were lagging our shipment growth with the increase in our headcount last year, and so now we should be in a more normalized pace where you see headcount and shipments trending a little bit closer together. And typically, you would see headcount actually leading the shipment growth. So we've got employees in and trained before the -- really, the shipments are picking up. So I think we're in good shape with our network. I think we're in good shape with our employee capacity. We probably got a little bit tight with our equipment in the fourth quarter as well and had some rentals in some places, in which the cost of those are increasing, but we tried to have very little of that. And I think that we've got a good CapEx plan this year that will address any specific needs, and those are usually localized in any particular place. We've got 229 service centers now, and we're going to keep -- we've got a good CapEx plan at $510 million and keep adding where we need to, to make sure we've got the necessary capacity. Operator : We'll go next to Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Adam, could you just talk about the sequential change in tonnage in January, both actual 10-year average? I think you gave year-over-year. And then just given the growth and pricing dynamics in the quarter, I would've probably expect that incremental margins to have accelerated from where they were in the third quarter. You did add -- I saw you added 6% year-on-year growth in employees. Is that employee count now reflective of maybe the growth that you're seeing in January as well and so maybe we can see a reacceleration in incrementals in the first quarter? Are there other puts and takes in terms of the benefits costs? Just if you can just help us out, that would be helpful. Adam Satterfield : To start with the first part of that question, the sequential change on the weight going into January, so I mentioned that we had a 14.4% year-over-year increase there. It was an increase of 0.8% compared to December. The 10-year average is an increase of 1.9%, so it was somewhat below average, but it's not surprising when you only look at that on a 1 month basis. And we've had really performance well above normal sequentials going back to September when, if you recall, our weight in September over August was a positive 7% when it's -- the 10-year average is a 3%, and then we performed above trend for each month through the fourth quarter. So typically, when you got 1 month that far ahead of the average, the next month might be under and not complete the price. But I think our volumes just -- they continue to be really strong, and we had a really nice January. In regards to the incrementals, I mean, just like what I was discussing with Brad, I think that the fourth quarter was, we consider, a good performance. And we knew that we had some cost headwinds that we were anticipating, but frankly, we had such strong revenue growth through the quarter that we think that offsets some of the cost headwinds that were in place. But we typically -- going back to David's comment about our cost structure, there are quarters where the incrementals may be 30 and, in some cases in the history, up to 35%, but we've never said that over the long run, that that's what we're targeting for. I think that the 25% is a good metric. When you break down our operating ratio, 60% to 65% of our costs are kind of direct variable operating costs. And then in our overhead base, you've got some variable costs there as well. But that's how we've been able to get to that 30%, 35% range. Right now, if we can continue to target 25%, I think that's a healthy incremental. David Congdon : One thing I'll point out, Amit, is that mathematically, the higher our revenue growth is, the incremental looks lower for, call it, 1/10 of an operating point change. It's a mathematical thing. So don't let the percentages fool you. When we had very low revenue growth, we were kicking out from really high incremental margins. And it's just the mathematics of it, a little bit more than it is the reality. Amit Mehrotra : Yes. I guess a lot large numbers. One quick follow-up for me with respect to the market share comment. The tonnage growth that you're seeing, you talked about kind of a market share, it seems like -- it certainly seems like it's a market share grab relative what it was some of the other LTL companies were reporting. But the question really is, are you also seeing spillover volumes from heavier truckload shipments, which I guess would benefit you given sort of your disproportionate exposure to the sort of the industrial production, industrial economy? Any thoughts there in terms of are you seeing those spillover volumes? Is that -- has that started to occur yet and maybe that's driving some of the very, very strong tonnage growth? David Congdon : We cannot really identify the spillover very well. We have spot quotes and things like that, that come in, and those -- a lot of those shipments weigh in the 8,000 or 9,000 pound category. Maybe it's spillover from truckload, but we haven't seen a tremendous increase in those spot quotes. Our overall weight per shipment, I think, grew, what, 2.7%. Is that what it's about? I think that was the number we reported this morning. And we think that is more related to the economy improving and buyers ordering larger quantities in their orders because the weight per shipment increased. I believe the industry is up as well but the last number I saw there, the industry is up a little bit less than we are on weight per shipment, but that's primarily economically driven, I believe. Operator : We'll go next to Allison Landry with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Allison Landry : So you guys talked about the January tonnage and sequential trends, but I apologize if I missed this, but did you speak to the yields in January sequentially from December? Adam Satterfield : I didn't. I mean, I gave that overall revenues is about 19.5% and then you've got the tonnage number, which was 14.4%. So you can kind of back into. But it's trending in about the same range where we've seen it or at least this most recent quarter. Allison Landry : Okay. And weight per shipment is coming off a little bit sequentially in January. Did I hear that right? Adam Satterfield : You did. Compared to December, our December bumped up, that was the highest. It was at 1,661 pounds. It trended back to 1,644 in January. And so we initially saw that bump in September where we had been continuing to see 1,550 pounds weight per shipment, plus or minus, for the longest time. And then we got that nice bump in September, and it stayed fairly consistent from there. So we're back in the range really where we kind of saw for most of 2014 and kind of the early part of '15. So we think that it's just some heavier weight of shipments, to David's point, on the economy. And definitely some shippers -- we've got some customer feedback that can't necessarily fine truckload, and it may have been the multi-stock kind of truckload shipments that should've been in LTL anyways and so shippers now with truckload capacity tightening up or moving freight in the mode that where it really should, we think. Allison Landry : Okay. So sounds like the December trend, which was what you would characterize as maybe unusual, could've been driven by TL spillover. Any -- is there any trends that you saw to suggest that online heavy goods are moving more in LTL networks? Is that impacting you guys at all? Adam Satterfield : It may be a little bit early for that still, but we're continuing to see good success with our retail shippers. And I think that in the fourth quarter, we probably saw a little bit more revenue growth with retail-related shippers than industrial. But keep in mind that, that 60% about -- of our revenue is industrial-related, 25% retail. So it's a smaller component today as it is for many LTL carriers, I think, but we're certainly starting to see some success there. And it really just goes into the long-term thesis of -- we believe, is more fulfillment centers are built, it's going to be more conducive to LTL, quantity of freight and supply chains become more sophisticated and delivery windows are tighter. That plays more to a high service carrier like ourselves. And so I think that for many of those reasons, when you start thinking about fines that are charged back to the shippers, it changes the conversation from just a discount point on a freight deal from one carrier to the next to what can be the total value proposition. And we think that's a big part of why we continue to win market share. Allison Landry : Okay, that's definitely interesting in terms of that long-term trend. And maybe following up on that, do you, see at some point in the future, yourselves, I guess, going into residential at all? I mean, of course, you'd need smaller trucks. But is that something that you guys are looking at? Or does that not fit within what you think your core competency is? David Congdon : We do residential deliveries now with multiple -- we have multiple liftgate trailers at every service center. And we have some that are short that go into neighborhoods. And so we do that business, but we're not really focused on trying to grow residential deliveries. And we don't -- not to say we won't get into it someday in the future, but it's not our priority right now. Allison Landry : Got it, that makes sense. And then lastly, I just wanted to ask about how you're thinking about productivity in 2018, maybe if there's any buckets that you've carved out. And to the extent that you have, if there's any way to quantify it in either dollar terms or as a percent of sales. Adam Satterfield : We believe we've got opportunities for continued gains in productivity. This year, we saw pretty nice performance with our P&D and line-haul operations. In the most recent quarter, our P&D shipments [indiscernible] were up about 2%. Our line-haul load average was up just a little under 2% as well. Probably the biggest opportunity for us next year is on the dock in the fourth quarter. Our dock shipments per hour were down about 3%. So I think that we've got an opportunity there. But some of that dock performances, we hired an awful lot of people this year and the newer employees that were hired as volumes were really accelerating, most of the employee additions were in the back half of the year, so it was sort of jumping right into the fire, aren't and weren't as productive. So we certainly got some opportunity there, and we're always focused on continuous improvement in ways we can get better with running all aspects of our operation. Allison Landry : Okay, got it. So it sounds like at least from the employee productivity standpoint with another year under their belts, you potentially could see more productivity in the second half of the year? Is that fair in thinking about the cadence? Adam Satterfield : I think that the employee base is in place now. We're starting to see, in some of the later months, some improvement there, and so we certainly would expect to see it. But I mean, overall, for cost inflation going into next year and that we mentioned in our release, that we may have some increased benefit cost, we believe it's probably going to be more in the 4% to 4.5% range on a per-shipment basis when you take fuel cost out of it. And obviously, fuel right now is trending higher on a year-over-year basis than where we were in the early part of 2017. So if we can keep total cost in check, and we're always focused on opportunities there, and as well as other costs that we can control, discretionary types of spending, we'll do our best. And we were thinking that this year going into the year, that cost inflation might be about 4%. And I think we finished just about there, maybe slightly better. And then on the flip side, and consistent with our pricing philosophy, we've got the target increases that will offset that cost inflation for us. Operator : We'll go next to Ari Rosa with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ariel Rosa : So just wanted to start with the new hires. Maybe if you could give us a little more color on which divisions you were hiring new employees into and kind of what the breakdown was between sales versus dock versus drivers. And then remind me again what's the usual time line for those -- for kind of a new hire to ramp up to full levels of productivity consistent with kind of experienced hires. Adam Satterfield : Yes. I mean, it was mainly productive labor with drivers and our dockworkers that were hired, not as many salaried and clerical-type positions. And that was just consistent with the growth that we started seeing. And remember, in the early part of last year, our revenue was only growing at 6.5% in the first quarter. So we saw acceleration in the second, third quarters and then a pickup again in the fourth quarter. And so we were -- like I mentioned before, we were just kind of playing catch-up a little bit. It required us to use a little bit of purchase transportation, last year to help take some of the pressure off our line-haul operations primarily. So I think that we like to have our employees in place. And the training can take a couple of months, a couple of 3 months. It would be perfect to make sure everybody is delivering that superior service. David Congdon : Yes. And if a guy has never worked freight before and never packed a trailer before, there are awful lot of things that they learn over a long period of time before they become totally productive. And the way that we handle freight and pack trailers and use our dunnage and our racks and drafts and all that stuff, it takes time to learn how to put the puzzle together as you're loading a trailer and to do it in -- and do it quickly like the old-timers can. It could be 6 months before someone becomes really productive. And then over the next year, they even become more productive but not quite as the rate -- at the rate that they would have in first 6 months. Ariel Rosa : Sure, that makes a lot of sense. And then just wanted to switch gears a little bit. On the pricing side, you obviously talked about market share wins in 2018 or expected market share wins. Should I read into that, that maybe the pricing strategy is going to be a little bit less aggressive in terms of relative to the market overall with the objective of maybe gaining some share and then getting to that double-digit type of market share target that you guys have held? David Congdon : We do not plan to be less aggressive in order to gain more market share. We expect to continue our fair and equitable pricing strategy, looking at each individual account on its own merit and being fair with our customers and not overly aggressive on raising prices, but not overly aggressive trying to give the store away just for the sake of gaining share. Ariel Rosa : So let me just maybe be a little bit more specific. I think in the past, you guys have spoken about, I think, a 3.5% to 4% price or rate increase target on an annualized basis x fuel. Is that still consistent? David Congdon : Yes, sir. Ariel Rosa : Okay, great. And then just last question for me. There's been a lot of talk on the truckload side about risks of -- the benefits from the tax cuts maybe being competed away as people add capacity. Just wanted to get your thoughts on whether you think that's a risk in the LTL space and/or if maybe that's less of a risk than it would be on the truckload side? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I think it's less of a risk, same conversations we were having back in 2016. When you look at the profit margins in the LTL space and the fact that our industry is so consolidated with 80% of the revenue in the top team carriers, I'm guessing that the other carriers are going to let that tax change fall to the bottom line and potentially start being able to invest if they're earning their cost of capital. We certainly don't intend to compete it in a way. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Christian Wetherbee : I want to come back to pricing a little bit, and I think a lot of us kind of have questions of trying to relate what's going on in LTL to what's happening in the truckload market. And obviously, there's tightness there, and we're seeing rate increases coming in higher than typical sort of normal rate increases would see. So as we think about that relationship, could you kind of help us a little bit, maybe frame it up with the 3.5% to 4% annual price increases x fuel. Is this the kind of year where you can get sort of the high end of that because of what's going on in the truckload market? Or should we maybe sort or pull the 2 of them apart and think about it more specifically to LTL? Just trying to get some sense around that would be helpful. Adam Satterfield : Yes. I think looking at it separately is better. And if you go back, our long-term pricing philosophy and conversations we have with customers is we want to obtain the increases that are necessary to offset our cost inflation, and there are other specific account profitability issues that we addressed. But our pricing is that we look at account by account profitability, and that's how we'll continue to look at it. If you go back as far back as 2000, our revenue per hundredweight is increasing between 3% and 3.5%. So we don't have to necessarily play the roller coaster game with our customers when times are tight, trying to increase rates at well above something that's more inflationary base. And then when they're loose, trying to go in with discounts and feedback from customers has been that they appreciate that and that's why we've had long-term market share success. So we'll continue to have those same types of conversations. And it may be higher than the 4% this year again because we're thinking inflation may be -- our own cost inflation may be between 4% to 4.5%. So we'll have to target that. And then again, we'll address on account-by-account basis any that are underperforming where we think they'll be or where they should be rather. But we're going to continue to keep the same philosophy and not really make any drastic changes, and we think that that's been key to our long-term profitable growth in the past and will help us for the future. Christian Wetherbee : Okay, okay. No, that's helpful. That's actually very clear. I appreciate it. Wanted to ask just a question on that sort of cost inflation. You've mentioned in the release about some employee benefit inflationary expense. I don't know if you can help us kind of parse that out when you think about that 4%, 4.5% inflation on a shipment basis or maybe some numbers around what you're actually seeing on that, that employee inflation side. Just trying to get a sense of maybe how that kind of plays in. Obviously, we're thinking about it in the context of incremental margins, which you've talked about, but want to get a sense that there's some specifics behind that comment. Adam Satterfield : Yes. I mean, the biggest thing was I wanted people to see that this tax cut thing, that this wasn't just a onetime bonus that we paid in the fourth quarter. We will have ongoing expense, and that's related to -- you can take the change in our net income related to our old effective tax rate, that it's been around 38.5%, to the what our new effective tax rate is, and we think that'll be around 26.5%. And so we've historically provided 10% of net income back to employees in their 401(k) plans. So there will be ongoing costs related to that. I mean, obviously, on a net-net basis, the tax change will benefit significantly our bottom line. And we think it was a great thing not only for us, but for the economy as a whole. But breaking down our cost inflation, the biggest element is the wage increase that we provided to employees last year. That was about 3% in September. So we will have that. We had really good performance on the benefit side this year, and that was primarily some good trends that we had with health and dental costs. But there may be some other costs, as I just mentioned, on the benefit side that will increase slightly. And then we'll have other things that are increasing through the year, and there are some unknowns that we don't know right now as well. I mean, there's other states that are talking about change in payroll taxes. There could be cost inflation that we're not aware of yet, that may come from the overall investment and infrastructure. That could come through in the form of fuel taxes that -- we still have some uncertainty that's hanging out there in terms of some taxes that we may get hit with. Operator : We'll go next to the Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Just a couple of follow-ups here. On your target for growing share, can you tell who you're gaining the share from? Is it some of the larger consolidated players out there? Or is it from some of the more smaller carriers? I believe some of them -- some of the regional players were having some difficulties about 6 months ago. Have you seen that accelerate? And is that the source of the share gains? David Congdon : Ravi, you can't put your finger on exactly where it's coming from. I mean, our growth rates across the whole network -- and we break our company into 10 regions. We're strong, have gotten strong growth happening everywhere. So I'd say it's really across-the-board. There's no one particular carrier or one particular region. Ravi Shanker : Okay. And then in terms of that growth -- sorry if I missed this. But did you -- do you say kind of which end markets and which regions are showing the most growth? Or is that mostly broad-based? David Congdon : It's just -- it's broad-based. We don't report our regional patterns and things like that specifically. Ravi Shanker : Okay. And just lastly, on the tax side. We kind of briefly spoke right after Tesla kind of showed us their truck last year. I'm wondering if you've had any more time to kind of assess the capabilities of that vehicle and maybe that or kind of other EV/ [indiscernible] up to speed on what are you seeing out there on the tech front. David Congdon : We are keeping our eyes on all the new technologies out there. We've had meetings with several of the new tractor manufacturers, and our position is to kind of wait and see. And there are honestly more questions than there are answers with electrification and with hydroelectric and with tuning. And there's more questions and answers, and we're not jumping into anything at this point. Operator : We'll go next to Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Fowler : I don't want to get too granular, but some of your competitors have talked about you're starting off maybe a little bit softer because of the timing of holidays and weather. Adam, I know that you gave the sequential trends between January and December. But I'm just curious, your experience here during the year in January, were there any unusual trends from a weather standpoint or from a holiday standpoint? Or has freight seemed pretty consistent here for the first 4 or 5 weeks? Adam Satterfield : Freight's been pretty consistent. Certainly, there was weather events in January that we dealt with this year. But I mean, the reality is we deal with weather events every January and when you look at our 10-year average sequential trends, the bad Januaries are in there as well as Februaries. And I think that I can look at certain days and kind of the middle of the month where we had some impact, particularly some of the storms that moved through the Midwest and Northeast, but you recover some of that freight. Some other freight may move to a different mode, but certainly, the way we finished out the month of January was pretty strong. And I think that was probably recapturing some of that freight. But overall, the growth that we had in January was pretty strong, that felt like. Todd Fowler : Okay. Good, that helps. And then just as far as commentary around purchased transportation and the increased rentals. And I noticed a percentage of your cost base sits lower than your peer group. Would you expect that to normalize in the first half of '18? Or is that something in the second half of '18? And then just from a capacity standpoint, I understand that you're bringing in equipment. But as far as driver availability and probably moving people from the docks into the trucks, do you have the labor availability to also handle the incremental freight with your own equipment? David Congdon : Yes. We have the capacity to handle the freight with our own equipment, and we have no intentions of increasing purchase transportation. It's not a big part of our -- it may be end of the month, end of the quarter. We might have to use a little bit of it. But for the most part, we feel like we're geared up appropriately, as we mentioned earlier, the 1,400 people we have added in the second half of the year. We've -- we saw freight strong in December, and it was an unusual time because we were actually hiring in December. And that's -- that hasn't happened in a long, long time. But looking at our tonnage growth for December, tonnage growth for January and how things are trending this year, I'm glad as hell our operating people had the foresight to add the people. Todd Fowler : Okay. And David -- go ahead, Adam, I'm sorry. Adam Satterfield : I was just going to add that while we increased the purchased transportation a little bit last year to supplement, as necessary, it was really only about a 10 to 20 basis point kind of increase from the year before. It was -- most of our purchased transportation relates to our Canadian services and our truckload brokerage and some other things. So it was really just -- it was a minor increase that we dealt with. But -- so it wouldn't be a material swing back if we can eliminate those few runs that we had to make use of. Todd Fowler : Okay, that makes sense. And just the stuff I wanted to ask David was that the pipeline for the drivers, most of that would be internal candidates that are kind of progressing up either from the docks to the trucks or something like that. David Congdon : We're continuing that, and we're hiring our drivers -- just experienced drivers as well. But the driver shortage is for real out there. It's tough to find good drivers. And more and more, we're trying to beef up our internal schools and our focus on people that want to become truck drivers and be promoted from within. Operator : We'll go next to Matt Brooklier with Buckingham Research. Matthew Brooklier : Adam, could you talk to where the service center account ended the year and then maybe also talk to your expectations for opening new service centers in '18? Adam Satterfield : Yes. We finished the year with 229 facilities, and I mentioned in my comments, with the CapEx plan for this year for real estate, it's about $200 million. And we think that we'll get -- maybe finish the year with somewhere around 235 to 240 facilities in place, and a lot of that's just subject to timing, completing projects and so forth. Matthew Brooklier : Okay. So that would be an increased pace, I guess, in terms of service center openings when compared to '17. Adam Satterfield : It would be, yes. Matthew Brooklier : Okay. And then you talked also just the CapEx plan. I think the expectations for tractor purchases that, that's also a pretty significant amount. Obviously, you guys are growing. Could you talk to maybe roughly how much of that incremental CapEx is being put forth to grow your fleet versus replenishments? So is there any change there in terms of how you're looking at maybe fleet replenishment? I think that there's -- the thought process that the market's having, and this is across like broader trucking, adding a lot of trucks for the market, and there's a concern that, obviously, potentially, more supply would work against the ability to raise price. But I guess my question comes down to, are you spending more to replenish more trucks this year? And maybe talk to -- what are your expectations for the net growth of the fleet in '18? Adam Satterfield : And if you look, we kind of average replacement cycle as maybe $150 million or so on the tractors and trailers side, and that varies each year based on what we did 10 years ago. David Congdon : But that can get larger because the fleet's larger. So the replenishment will always be a growing number. Adam Satterfield : Right. And remember that last year, what we had designated for some replacement equipment, because of our growth, we kept in the fleet. So there probably is a little bit more replacement. But our fleet's in very good shape. We finished the year the average age of our tractors is right at four years, and it was 4.5 at the end of 2016. So I think we're in really good shape. And by the execution of this $265 million spend this year, we should be where we need to be, we think. But we'll continue to evaluate as we progress through the year as well and look at -- and see how we're trending when it comes to our tractor and trailer counts. And we look at certain efficiency metrics there with our fleet, and we'll make changes as necessary. Operator : We'll go next to Jason Seidl with Cowen. Jason Seidl : Just a couple of quick ones for me. Looking at the rest of 2018, clearly, 4Q was exceptional for you guys, and there was some weather in there and probably some ELD-related stuff that pushed freight towards the LTL sector. How should view 4Q of this year? Should we think that that's going to revert to a more normalized seasonal pattern where there's a negative sequential increase in tonnage from the third quarter? David Congdon : That's a real crystal ball question. What do you think is going to happen? Jason Seidl : Well, look, I think it's kind of a little funky there with the 2 storms, but we'll have to see. I mean, you -- obviously, you guys did a great job in handling the freight in the business, and clearly, the pricing environment looks pretty favorable for you guys. The other question I had, could you remind us about your working days in the quarter on a quarterly basis throughout 2018? Adam Satterfield : Yes. Hang on one second now. That we -- so we'll have 64 days in the first quarter, 64 days in the second quarter, 63 days in the third quarter and 63 days in the fourth quarter. So the first 3 quarters line up to last year. The fourth quarter will include 1 extra work day. Operator : We'll go next to Willard Milby with Seaport Global Securities. Willard Milby : I wanted to kind of look at some expense lines. I guess insurance and claims stepped up here from Q3. Was that kind of one event or a couple of little things? And has any of that kind of lingered into the first half of Q1? Adam Satterfield : So in the fourth quarter each year, we conduct an annual actuarial study, and there occasionally will be adjustments that we make to the valuation on prior year claims. And so I think what we had this year in the fourth quarter was maybe a slight unfavorable adjustment, and then the fourth quarter of '16 was probably a slight favorable. This year was slightly unfavorable versus last year being slightly favorable, if I said that correctly. But yes, that 1.4%, we tend to be somewhere between 1.2% and 1.4% or at least that was the trend that we went through last year. And those -- the 2 costs that are in that line item are auto liability claims on highway incidents and in our cargo claims ratio as well, which continues to be what we believe is best-in-class. It was less than 0.3% here in the fourth quarter, and it's been in that 0.2%, 0.3% range for most of 2017. Willard Milby : All right. And I guess similar question for the miscellaneous expenses. I mean, seen a step-up from Q3 there, and I know in the past, there's been IT-related expenses and real estate-related charges in that line. Was there any kind of onetime or nonrecurring stuff that shouldn't happen again in Q1? And what kind of went on here in Q4? Adam Satterfield : So it stepped up a little bit this year and not necessarily onetime, but that item does include multiple things or probably some increased consulting expenditures that were in there. Any types of gains or losses are reported in that line item as well, and I think we had some losses as we disposed of some older equipment in the fourth quarter that added a little bit of expense. Willard Milby : Okay. And I guess kind of going back to the terminal additions here in '18. I know historically, we kind of looked at 2 to 4 a year and kind of stepped up to maybe 5 to 10. Should we kind of read into that, that maybe your current land usage or footprint is maybe maxed out and you're having to go out and find new locations for terminals? Or is there still ample capacity to add dock doors under your current footprint and maybe this year is just a bit of a different strategy? David Congdon : It was across-the-board. We have facilities that we have land that we can expand, and we have some where we have no land and we have no choice but to go and buy land and build a new one. Some of our large markets, like Chicago and L.A. and Atlanta and places like that, we're adding additional service centers in those large markets, because of the traffic situation and all the windshield time you have with drivers trying to run along peddle runs. But if we can expand the facility, we always try to do that. And if we cannot expand and we need more capacity, we'll either do a spin-off in that city or we'll go buy land and build something bigger. Willard Milby : All right. And as I kind of think about adding these service centers, is -- are you adding kind of, I guess in the bigger markets, adding a third to a second? Or are you kind of seeing more of the smaller cities getting a second terminal just go around? And I'm just trying to think of where you're trying to get more density. David Congdon : It's both. We've been talking for the last several years that we expected our network to grow out to the 250, 260 service centers, and part of that is expanding within the large metro markets and part of that is filling in, in states where we're running long peddle runs to deliver into and serve a particular market. So some are new and some are within existing markets. Operator : We'll go next to Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : So I know YRC's out with a GRI, I think, takes us back to next week or 2. Do you guys have plans to do a similar kind of February, March GRI? David Congdon : We have not made any decision on that as of yet. Scott Group : Do this seem a little odd to you that nobody else has followed yet? David Congdon : Well, a little bit. As you say that, it is kind of odd nobody else has followed yet. But it's -- we'll just have to wait and see. Scott Group : I think you were asked this earlier, but I'll try a little bit more directly. Given some of the labor negotiations that aren't fast and now YRC with the GRI by itself, do you think that -- can you tell us if more of your shares is coming from them? I mean, just based on their tonnage in January, it seems like it is. But do you think there's an opportunity for that to accelerate? David Congdon : That's hard to say, Scott. We can't identify that we have taken business from our best ORC because of labor negotiations, and we're certainly not trying to go out and target them because of it either. So -- it may be the case, maybe that's -- but we're certainly not focused on it. Scott Group : Okay. And then just on fuel. Is there any way to sort of quantify the benefit from a margin or dollar standpoint from fuel in the quarter? And would you think you'd see a bigger benefit in first quarter? Adam Satterfield : I think that's always a dangerous thing to try to do, to try to say what if fuel was X or Y. The way our surcharge program works is it should be a net neutral. And that -- it may change as we go up and down the spectrum. And certainly, we've had some periods where when there's rapid changes, it can be more of an immediate impact. But the fuel cost was up -- or price per gallon was up 16% in the fourth quarter. And on a year-over-year basis, that's about where we're trending right now in the first quarter when it's bringing it around $3 a gallon right now. Scott Group : So maybe given some of the change in the slope of your surcharge curve that you made a few years ago, we shouldn't think about fuel necessarily as a -- rising fuel as a earnings tailwind for you anymore. Adam Satterfield : I think that -- yes, I think that's a good way to say it, the way you did. But we try to address up and down the spectrum on the surcharge tape on it. Remember, as it was falling, we had to go in and address some of the low end. And I think we accomplished that because the fuel has stayed and its increasing now, but fairly steady range. Operator : We'll go next to Ben Hartford with Baird. Zachary Rosenberg : This is actually Zach Rosenberg on for Ben. So I just have one. Thinking through the dividend increase, maybe it being a little bit higher because of the Tax Act, just trying to think through and if you could refresh us on maybe your dividend strategy going forward and maybe how you think about increases in the coming years and along with that, in the context of the higher CapEx, about share repurchase and other use of the cash. Adam Satterfield : Yes. When we started the dividend last year, we kind of looked at what we thought the annual payout would be and what sort of the prior year's net income was. And that was some of the thinking that went in. So obviously, with the impact of a tax change, we felt like it was necessary to maybe increase it a little bit more and evaluate it just like we were putting the program in place this year, and so that was the 30% increase. And we'll evaluate that as we go and don't want to indicate what the increase might be going forward. But I think like what we said earlier, it was the 30% was probably higher than what we would've initially thought it was going to be for the year. But -- so that'll just be one of the many elements that we continue to evaluate. And the buyback program, we bought back less shares last year. And we primarily buy on 10b5 basis and the valuation, and we've got a grid that works.  We felt like the stock price was baking in some element of the tax reform as we went through last year. And so the price was higher than where we were buying as a company on our grid. So we'll reevaluate that program and are evaluating that program now. But obviously, when we put the buyback program in place in 2014, we felt like that was the best method to return capital to shareholders. And we would anticipate that we will return more capital to shareholders through the buyback program on a long-term basis than we would through the dividend. Operator : This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Earl Congdon for any closing remarks. Earl Congdon : Well, we'd like to thank all of you for your participation today, and we sure appreciate your questions and great ones came through. And please feel free to give us a call if you have any further questions.  Thanks, and have a great day. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Please go ahead, sir. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Good morning and welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me on the call today are Earl Congdon, Old Dominion's Executive Chairman; Greg Gantt our President and Chief Operating Officer; Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. What a great quarter to start 2018. I can think of no better way to approach the end of my tenure as Old Dominion's Vice Chairman and CEO than to have such a strong quarter to accompany our previously announced leadership transition. As you know, since our last conference call, we announced strategic leadership changes that the board approved under our designed long-term succession plan. Greg Gantt will become our President and CEO effective May 16th, I will become Executive Chairman succeeding Earl Congdon, who will become Senior Executive Chairman. I'm very proud of the board and our leadership team for their careful planning and preparation for this change and I expect the transition to be seamless. Important to note that Earl and I will remain actively engaged in the company as board members and executive officers. Neither of us is ready to retire. We are significantly invested in this company, both personally and professionally, our continued influence is important and we love being part of such a high quality team. Just as Earl recognized that I was CEO when he transitioned the position to me, I also recognize Greg Gantt will be our CEO as of May 16th. Given this, I look forward to having the flexibility to dive deeply into my new role as Executive Chairman. Being able to call on Earl's experience and perspective has been a great asset for Old Dominion and me personally, and I believe I can add the same kind of value in my role for many years to come. The board and executive management team have the fullest confidence in Greg Gantt's ability to lead Old Dominion to new highs. He has consistently demonstrated his capabilities in his 24 years at the company, and since 2002 when he was named Senior Vice President-Operations, he has been the primary driver of our industry leading service product. His intense focus on building quality and superior performance is not only his own personal hallmark, but it continues to drive the customer and people-centric culture of the company. While every employee plays a role in providing superior service, Greg's leadership as well as that of his management team have been the motivating force behind the consistent improvement in our service metrics. Shippers increasingly appreciate and trust our service product as evidenced by our long-term growth in market share as well as our recognition by the Mastio & Company as the number one LTL carrier for eight consecutive years. I also want to take this opportunity to recognize and thank Earl Congdon for the leadership he has given Old Dominion in his nearly 70 years of service since becoming General Manager in 1950 following his father's untimely passing. He has been an invaluable mentor and counselor for me and our entire leadership team, as well as an inspiration to the entire company. We are delighted that he plans to continue his active participation on the board and the executive management team. And finally I'd like to recognize our board of directors for their foresight, guidance and support as we've prepared the company for this transition. I will always appreciate the board's confidence in me, in my executive leadership roles at the company for the last 20-plus years and in my continuing role as Executive Chairman and as a member of the executive management team. With that, I'll turn the floor over to Greg Gantt to discuss our first quarter results. Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Thanks, David and good morning. Let me start by adding my thanks to all the employees of Old Dominion. Our ever-expanding team continues to raise the bar every quarter and our ability to maintain superior service with double-digit volume growth during the first quarter was impressive. Just in case there is any question about my focus when I step into my new role of President and CEO next month, I want to be perfectly clear. I do not intend to deviate from the business strategies that have created our unique position in the industry and driven the significant long-term increase in shareholder value. We will continue to focus on providing superior service at a fair price, while also continuously investing in capacity and our people to support our long-term growth objectives. We will also look to continuously improve all areas of our operation, which is a critical component of our foundation of success. These strategies have been in place for years and are continuously reviewed by our senior leadership team. Thanks to this experienced team, which I've been fortunate to be a part of for many years, Old Dominion has created an unequalled record of long-term growth in the LTL industry. We entered 2018 with operating momentum and believed we were uniquely positioned to win further market share by continuing to deliver our value proposition of superior service at a fair price. I was pleased with our first quarter results, which included significant revenue growth of over 20%. This revenue growth included a combination of a 15.4% increase in LTL tons and a 5.9% improvement in LTL revenue per hundredweight in what has continued to be a favorable pricing environment. Handling this kind of growth which included a 10.5% increase in LTL shipments while maintaining best-in-class quality standards and disciplined account profitability goals is not always easy. Yet, not only did we maintain the extraordinary service that Old Dominion is known for, with on-time delivery of 99% and a cargo claims ratio of 0.2%, but we also produced a 180 basis point improvement in our operating ratio, which is a new first quarter record for the company. Challenges of producing this kind of performance in these circumstances are evident and some loss of productivity in our platform and pickup and delivery operations. Nevertheless our strong margin and earnings growth show why we will always be willing to do what it takes to meet our service standards, even if we incur additional cost to do so, as we did in the first quarter. When we deliver our value proposition, lost productivity in a given quarter represents a future opportunity to drive improvement in future periods, while maintaining a service product that our customers have come to expect and rely upon. We are proud of our first quarter accomplishments which differentiates our company like nothing else and proud of the people who produce them. We thank everyone from our newest employee to our longest serving. From this great start to 2018, we believe favorable industry dynamics remain in place for the industry to continue its growth in 2018. And with continued execution of our business strategies, Old Dominion is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. Thanks for your interest in Old Dominion. Now here is Adam Satterfield to review our first quarter numbers in greater detail. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue grew 22.7% in the first quarter to $925 million. Our operating ratio improved 180 basis points to 83.9% and our income before tax increased 37.6%. Earnings per diluted share benefited from a lower effective tax rate and increased 66.3% to $1.33 for the quarter. Our revenue growth for the first quarter once again included a nice mix of increases in LTL tonnage and yield. LTL tons per day increased 15.4% as compared to the first quarter of 2017 with LTL shipments per day increasing 10.5% and LTL weight per shipment increasing 4.5%. We were pleased to see the accelerated pace of revenue growth that began last year continue into the first quarter. Our growth continues to be supported by the strength of the domestic economy and general tightness of capacity within the transportation industry, which has created an environment where our business model shines. Looking at our growth on a sequential basis, first quarter LTL shipments per day increased 0.2% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, which was generally in line with the 10-year average sequential trend. LTL tons per day for the quarter decreased 0.4% as compared to a decrease of 0.9% for the long-term average. Monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the first quarter were as follows : January increased 0.8% as compared with December. February increased 2.9% versus January and March increased 2.6% as compared to February. The 10-year average change for the respective months are an increase of 1.9% in January, an increase of 1.7% in February and an increase of 5.2% in March. Please remember, however, that Good Friday was in March this year and the average sequential change for March when that is the case would be an increase of 2.9%, but we're pretty much in line for March. Update you on our volume trends thus far into April. LTL tons per day have increased between 15.5% and 16% as compared with April 2017 and this includes a 3% increase in LTL weight per shipment. As usual, we will provide actual April information with our first quarter 10-Q filing. The operating ratio for the first quarter improved 180 basis points to 83.9% with improvement in both our direct operating costs and our overhead expenses as a percent of revenue. Salaries, wages and benefit cost as a percent of revenue improved 100 basis points when compared to the first quarter of 2017, despite the impact of the anticipated increase in fringe benefit costs that we had discussed with you on our fourth quarter call. We will remain focused on matching our labor capacity with growth in LTL shipments during 2018, and as expected, those two metrics became more closely aligned in the first quarter consistent with historical trends. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $211.2 million for the first quarter and capital expenditures were $100.6 million. As noted in our release this morning, we increased our estimate for capital expenditures this year by $45 million based on our anticipated needs for the remainder of the year, while also giving some consideration for 2019. Our total is now estimated to be $555 million, which includes $310 million for tractors and trailers and approximately $200 million for real estate and service center expansion projects. We returned $28 million of capital to our shareholders during the first quarter and that total included $17.3 million of share repurchases after we began to repurchase shares in February. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 25.9% which was favorably impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as well as other favorable discrete tax items. Currently, anticipate an effective tax rate of 26.2% for each of the remaining quarters of 2018. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey thanks, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Appreciate it. Congrats on the good results. Adam, I think the incremental margin performance is kind of exactly what we would expect in terms of the middle of that sort of 20% to 30% book end. You know given the incremental investment and costs, you know the CapEx coming up a little bit, would you expect the incremental margin to kind of more trend now towards that 20% prospectively for the remainder of the quarter? Is that kind of the right way to think about as you progress through the year? Thanks. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Keep in mind, that we have said that the range is really 20% to 25% when you look over a longer-term and certainly there have been quarters where we've achieved 30% and really that's just when you break down our operating ratio, the direct operating cost or generally if you look at an 83% operating ratio rounded for last year, 60% to 65% of that is the direct operating cost and then 20% to 25% is our overhead type of expenses. So that kind of leverage that we can get in growth periods is why you can see that 30% type of number, but the 20% to 25% range. We've averaged about a 25% incremental more margin since 2010 and that's probably a more appropriate type of number. Keep in mind that in higher growth periods, it's a little tougher to achieve some of those higher numbers because you end up with just some inefficiencies that come with the growth and there's more that obviously you have to put to the bottom-line, but I thought that the 24% in the first quarter was good considering some of the loss of productivity that we had on our dock and the P&D operations and then just some of the other cost increases that we had in some of the other types of lines like miscellaneous expenses and some of the other expenses as well. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. And then just a follow-up for me. I know you provided the April year-on-year. If you could just \u2013 I don't know if you provided the sequential and how that trend has trended versus historical? And then also just related to that, it would be helpful to just update us on what you're seeing on the spot side of the business in terms of frequency of spot quotes and also the weigh trajectory. Just trying to see if we're starting to see any truckload spillover, given the tightness in that network onto the LTLs? Thanks. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: The April, I didn't give it, but the normal sequential trend is a 0.7% increase, but just like in my prepared comments about the Good Friday impact in March, it's got the reverse impact in April. So, when you look at the few years in the past dozen or so that where Good Friday was in March, the April increase would be a 2.2%. So where we are today which is between 15.5% and 16% is pretty much in line with that number, maybe slightly above, but for the most part in line. In terms of any spillover effects, similar to what we've said in prior periods. We try to control the growth. Most of those heavy weight shipments would come in through a spot quote type of basis and whether that's phone calls or through our website, and basically we turn up the rates to try to make sure that our operations doesn't get overwhelmed with any heavy weighted transactional type shipments, that may be more one-time in nature it's not consistent business that we would retain. We certainly don't want to disrupt our normal LTL shippers. I think the incoming calls may have increased, but we've done our best to try to control some of what you can see that may be a different type of indicators. When I look through our top 50 customers and look at the third-party logistics companies, that's what we're seeing; a lot of the increase in our weight per shipment there and I think some of that is probably indicative of the 3PLs that are able to maximize the relationships they were in earlier periods when truckload was a little bit weaker and maybe we're able to secure a capacity where there's a multi-stop type of arrangement. And now that that capacity is tightened up, they're moving heavier weighted shipments that should be in the LTL world back into our environment. So we've seen really a low double-digit type increase in weight per shipment in those 3PLs in our top 50. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. That's really helpful color. Thank you so much, guys. Appreciate it, everyone. Operator : Next we'll hear from Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Hey thanks. Good morning. Wanted to touch a little bit on pricing and just get a sense of sort of how you see that trending, and I guess as the first quarter progressed, and then maybe some thoughts on April. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Sure. It's obviously been a very favorable pricing environment and we've just continued to execute on our long-term pricing philosophy and trying to get the necessary increase to achieve or offset our cost inflation rather as well as to provide a return to continue to invest in our business and whether that's capacity and technology and so forth and things that our customers are demanding. I think that we saw improvement as we progressed through the first quarter. And our numbers when you look at the revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel was up 3.7% and that's even including a 4.5% increase in the weight per shipment and the 0.7% decrease in length of haul. So, there's not a linear relationship there. You can't necessarily apply those factors because there's a lot of mix change and so forth that also goes into it, but at the end of the day we were able to get revenue per shipment increases to offset the cost per shipment increases that we experienced in the first quarter and so that was a big driver of the operating ratio improvement. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Okay. Now that makes sense. And I think that's consistent you guys have talked about maybe that cost per shipment running up in the neighborhood of 4% to maybe 4.5% this year. Is that still sort of the right way to think about it? And I guess when that \u2013 I guess that sort of relationship between price and cost, I think you've said in the past that maybe you could be towards the upper end of that band on a pricing basis. Just kind of curious your thoughts around that? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Yeah. I mean from a yield and continue to try to separate yield from price because they're two different things, but over a longer-term basis, I mean our pricing philosophy has been what I said to try to get the necessary increases. And when you look back since 2001, revenue per shipment has averaged a 4.8% increase versus our cost per shipment increasing 4%. And so that's what we've been able to achieve over the longer run. In terms of the cost per shipment transfer this year, on our last quarter call I did indicate that we anticipated cost to be up 4% to 4.5% and probably at the north end of that range. And frankly in the first quarter, we had higher cost inflation than that. It was a little north of 7% when you take fuel out and there were some different cost elements going in that impacted that, but I do believe that we'll get back to that for 4% to 4.5% range in the remaining quarters of this year and certainly that's our goal. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Operator : Next we'll hear from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good morning. So thinking about head count, the increase year-over-year was obviously less than tonnage growth in the quarter. Is that what we should continue to expect for the next two quarters to three quarters, hoping just to get a sense of where you think you are from a resource standpoint relative to demand? Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Allison, this is Greg. We are hiring \u2013 we have a push on hiring and have had the entire year as we continue to grow and our tonnages continue to increase. We are hiring to meet those demands. So, it will trend somewhere in line with our growth, I would expect, but we are pushing very, very hard to hire to keep up with demand and that is a daily challenge, but so far so good. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Are you seeing more pressure in terms of recruitment for drivers? I mean, of course it's not what the TL carriers are seeing, but just curious with the labor market being very tight, if that's an incremental challenge for you guys. Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: The challenge ramps up as the growth increases obviously, but we're fortunate in that we train a very large percentage of our drivers. They come off of our platform and our truckload carriers don't have that chance. They don't have platforms. So fortunately for us, we've got a pretty good source to start with, but we are able to hire. Biggest challenge is to catch the need. Sometimes the business comes quicker than you can do the hiring and training and whatnot, but that's what Adam was talking about with the overruns we had on the platform and P&D is just, you can get them. But to get them up to speed, to get them trained and whatnot, it takes some time. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Right. Okay. And then my other question; just thinking about the weight per shipment. Adam, I know that you mentioned April sort of decelerated to around 3% year-over-year which of course is a step-down from the 4.5% in Q1 and it doesn't look like the comps are much \u2013 I mean they're a little bit easier. So I just was wondering how to think about what may have changed in terms of what would have driven that deceleration? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: (00:26:10) well, it's just cycled down a little bit. We got up to a peak of about 1,660 pounds in December of last year. That dropped a little bit in January to 1,640 pounds, which usually drops more than that. And then we have scaled back a little bit further to like 1,625 pounds in February and March and now we're right at about 1,600 pounds. So a lot of that just gets into the mix of freight that we're hauling. I don't necessarily think that there's any particular driver or whatnot that's going into that number. I was looking through some of the accounts that are showing decreases in weight per shipment and a lot of it looks like that we've got one that's got a big decrease, but we've had like 60% growth with that particular account. So when you grow that heavy with anyone, you're just getting a different mix of freight and I think that's really what the driver of some the pullback has been, but for us I think if we can see our weight per shipment somewhere around 1,600 pounds which is somewhere back in the ballpark that we were seeing in 2013 and 2014, that'd be a good thing for us. We're good with that. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And that's about where you are now. Is that correct? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Correct. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Or in April. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Allison, let me add one thing. So as our volumes in general with our LTL customers have been increasing fairly significantly, we keep turning up the volume or the price on our spot quote business, which tends to keep that from growing. And the LTL customers have lower weight per shipment. So part of it is probably that, where we turn up the pricing on volume shipments so that we can grow more LTL shipments, which brings the weight per shipment down naturally. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you. Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: And also, Allison as is typical as you length of haul drops, typically your weight per shipment will drop as well on comp (00:28:26). Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Okay. Thank you, guys. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Next we'll hear from Brad Delco of Stephens. Scott Anthony Schoenhaus - Stephens, Inc.: Hi guys. This is actually Scott Schoenhaus on for Brad. I guess I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the pricing environment. You talked about your spot business just now. Are you guys planning on putting any general rate increase like your competitors have put in for this year? I think they've all put in about 5.9%. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: We obviously will put one in at some point and it's something that we're still looking at and considering, but when the time is right, we're evaluating it frankly. We'll be out with one. Nothing has been announced to-date. Scott Anthony Schoenhaus - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thanks Adam. And I guess as my follow-up, a lot of discussion on the productivity pressure I guess in the first quarter. Is there any way to put some numbers on exactly what that did to incremental margins and so that we can think about going forward when you're continuing to hire given the tonnage growth, how to better model these incremental margins and the effect from lower productivity on new hires? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I don't know that there's any math that goes into that. Obviously, when you bring on new people and we've obviously got a lot of new employees on the dock, in particular, you know with the increases that we've had. And you know they're not as productive. And it takes \u2013 there's a learning curve of probably three to six months or so, but those employees are coming in at a lower wage as well. So there's a little bit of offset there but obviously we'd like to see them continue \u2013 the productivity metrics, that is, continue to improve and I think we've got some opportunity there as these employees that we brought on continue to gain experience. And the most important thing for us is to make sure that we're not letting our service metrics slip in any way. And service we continue to repeat it but service has really been the story behind our market share opportunity. And so we certainly want to make sure that despite the growth rates that we've seen that we certainly can keep those service metrics high. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I'll add. This is David, that we can't even calculate a correlation between productivity metrics and incremental margins. So it would be hard to model that exactly. It's just very hard to model that. I guess the only thing you can sort of model is how many dollars you might lose in platform dollars, or P&D, pickup and delivery dollars because of a lower productivity. That'd be the only way to do it. We don't even try to correlate it to what our incremental margin is. It just is what it is at the end of every quarter. Scott Anthony Schoenhaus - Stephens, Inc.: Appreciate the color guys. I'll hop in the queue. Thank you. Operator : Next we'll hear from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Shaked Atia - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, everyone. This is actually Shaked Atia here for Ravi. Thank you for taking my question. Quick follow-up on operating ratio. You typically see a 400 basis point improvement from the first quarter to the second quarter. Anything we should keep in mind that might keep that improvement more muted perhaps? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Well I mean that's been pretty consistent and it's about a 430 basis point. It's been the 10-year change there, which may make the \u2013 when you do the math from the first quarter ratio may make things interesting for what that potential could be in the second quarter, but we're going to continue to be disciplined with respect to our cost and continue to make strides and you know the productivity categories, but there's nothing that we see coming or that significant unusual or different in any way that we feel the need to sort of point out at least that we're aware of at this point. Shaked Atia - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And just my follow-up. So you did increase CapEx for the year. Can you maybe speak about the cadence of that throughout the year and how that might look like? David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: We increased our orders for both tractors and trailers. And the tractors should come in pretty much in line with what our normal delivery schedule was going to be regardless, and then the trailers would be similar. So I mean there would be a progression as we go through the second and third quarters getting things in as we're building up to the peaks later in the year, but some of the orders and considerations that we had to give was just based on the fact that everything you read and hear about order books billing up, we're certainly going to have a need for our equipment in 2019 whether it's what our normal replacements are going to be. And we haven't seen any signs or heard anything that would suggest that things will be changing with the economy. So we still feel like we've got some good growth opportunity ahead and we just want to make sure that we had the necessary equipment capacity to be in place to meet what our growth objectives would be. Shaked Atia - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. That's helpful. That's it for me. Operator : Matt Reustle of Goldman Sachs. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey thanks for taking my question, guys. Just going back to the weight per shipment just so I can understand it correctly. It sounds like you're continuing to see your customers increase their order size, but the mix of freight is changing. And the reason it feels like a pretty good barometer I think you referenced in the last quarter for the macro environment. So I just wanted to understand those two drivers there. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I think the macro continues to be strong from every measurement that we have and my only point about the weight per shipment cycling down somewhat is just that we're growing significantly with a lot of our big accounts. And with that growth comes a different mix of shipments in many ways. And sometimes you're awarded whether it's a different DC or different states or whatever and it can have a big impact on the weight per shipment based on the commodity that we might be hauling. So I wouldn't read too much into the fact that the rate of growth and our weight per shipment has slowed down. Every indicator that we have and feedback that we're receiving from customers continues to show signs of strength with the economy, and we don't necessarily think that any pullback in our weight per shipment would suggest otherwise. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. And then it's somewhat related in terms of market share growth versus general market growth. How would you discuss those dynamics and what you are seeing? And as you look into the second half of the year, I mean do you think you'll see a continuation of the market share growth that you guys have experienced recently? David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Our growth is mainly market share driven and so obviously we've got the support of the economy, but I think that it gets back. We always say that our long-term growth comes in the form of three things; delivering superior service, delivering that service at a fair price and maintaining adequate capacity to be able to grow. And I think that there's something to be said for the fact that we're consistently investing 12% to 15% of our revenue into our capital expenditures and that's certainly provided adequate network capacity, which we try to maintain at around 25% to accommodate growth. And with the growth that we've had, the network capacity isn't necessarily at that 25%. It's probably in the 15% to 20% range and maybe even in the lower side of that scale, but we've got a strong CapEx program to address any specific needs at the terminal level for capacity. We talked about equipment capacity and I think we've talked about getting the people in place to make sure that we can achieve our growth objectives for this year. So we feel like that everything is in place for us to continue to grow. The last piece that maybe gets overlooked too is these things aren't just percentages. You got to commend our sales force. There's a lot of men and women out in the field everyday going out and selling more business and they're doing a great job at it. So we certainly commend them. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Operator : And next we'll hear from to Todd Fowler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Greg or Adam, I'm not sure if you've shared this but I think in the past you've talked about how our contract renewals are coming in. And I think I understand the impact of weight per shipment and length of haul on yields, but do you have a number on what you're seeing from the contract renewals? And then just with respect to the timing of the contracts in this environment, do you still work through the book just ratably on a quarterly basis or do you make efforts to address some underperforming accounts just given the tightness that we're seeing in the market maybe some ability to pull forward some of the pricing? Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Todd, this is Greg. We will certainly review underperforming accounts, but most of our contractual accounts come up annually and that's when we typically look at the account has to perform and what we need and then we go from there. But the each accounts differ. We look at each account on an individual basis and we look at each lane of each account. So we'll look at it, try to determine what our needs are, maybe what we're better off without. Can we grow in certain other lanes and whatnot. So that's kind of an ongoing process that we look at every day, but out of cycle unless something is really out of whack we don't particularly do that again unless it's ugly. If it's ugly, we'll look at it. Otherwise, it's on an annual, when it's up for renewal. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That makes sense. And then did you have a number specifically for where the contract renewals are right now or would you care to share something like that? Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Probably not \u2013 probably don't want to share it. Again, it's on an individual basis. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's fine. And then Adam, just to come back to the conversation on the cost per shipments. Understanding that you're a little bit higher than the range with what you're expecting for the full year here in the first quarter. It sounds like that there's hiring that's going to come through. You're going to be adding some equipments later in the year. So to get you back into the range that 4% to 4.5%, should we think about that mostly as the employee productivity improving. Is it a function of seeing some of the yield improvements going through the years, is it some seasonality. Just at a high level, how do you go from being above that range right now to kind of getting back within that range as the year progresses? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Some of it. We had some specific increases that you see that, I think, were non-routine necessarily, but nothing material to call out. To start with, we talked about the fact that our fringe benefit cost would increase this year and that increased a little bit more than anticipated, but some of that was performance base driven. And if there's an increase in our 401(k) match related to the change in our effective tax rate, that was probably a couple million dollars and that'll be continuing, our health, vacation, sick, our paid time-off policies. There were some increases related to that but we had increased Phantom Stock expense in the first quarter that related to the improvement in our share price. So that some of it, there is a miscellaneous expenses. They were at 0.9%. That was a bit higher than expected and included some bad debt expense that we certainly not going to \u2013 would hope will not continue to repeat and there are just some other little things like that that may be stacked up against this where you've got other types of things that sometimes offset one versus another. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. So it sounds like even though you had strong incremental margin performance here in the quarter, there were also some miscellaneous costs embedded in the numbers that again you're not calling out as non-recurring, but were unfavorable from a reported results standpoint? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I mean the reality is there's always going to be things like this that come up and it's doing business and we're going to incur some of those costs. And that's why we just \u2013 it's not always going to be one specific number that we can manage to any particular quarter, but probably just had a little bit more of some other things in this particular period than another. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the time this morning. Nice quarter. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: (00:42:44) Todd. Operator : Next we'll hear from our Ariel Rosa of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ariel Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey good morning, guys. And just really quickly congratulations to Greg, David and Earl on the new roles and the work they've done. So just first question wanted to know, did you guys see any weather impact? A bunch of transportation companies have been calling out kind of a challenging weather conditions in the first quarter. We haven't really talked about it as it impacted OD. Just wanted to see your thoughts on how it may be impacted operations? Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: It was a tough winter and it was a long winter. I think maybe it's finally started to subside and turn spring in most of the country, but it was a long winter. It's not something we dwell on or talk about because we can't do anything about it. It is what it is. You have to deal with it. Do the best you can and move on. We certainly don't dwell on it. We try to deal with it, do the best we can, but thank goodness it's about over because it was long and it was very scattered this year. We had a lot of issues in the West, and then we had them across the Midwest to the North. So it was a very long winter. Ariel Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hopefully we won't see any more snow in the northeast, but you can never be sure I guess. Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Right. We're looking forward to a little spring and a lot of summer. Ariel Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Absolutely. So second question, I wanted to ask Greg specifically. Obviously you've been with the company for some time, but given the new role, are there any initiatives that you're undertaking or any kind of strategic initiatives that you're going to prioritize that might be a little bit different from the predecessors? Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Not really. We have a strategy and I'll certainly continue to try to execute it just as we have done in the past. So not really any new initiatives particularly, a lot of internal things that we'll be working on, but not any new particular initiatives we're talking about. Ariel Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. And then just I guess last question. Wanted to get your sense on \u2013 some industrial companies have talked through first quarter earnings about maybe this being as good as it gets. Just wanted to hear your thoughts on kind of the sustainability of the current operating environment. Can these really favorable conditions, can they last another one quarter, two quarters, or do you see this kind of lasting maybe two to three years out? And then within that, kind of your thinking on the growth initiatives. Obviously you're upping your spending on trucks. Is that kind of a permanently higher plateau that you'd like to achieve or is more of that focused on kind of replacement CapEx? Maybe your thoughts around just kind of where the market environment stands and how long this could go on for. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: The first part of your question may be beyond the scope of our economic forecasting abilities, but certainly it's a very favorable operating environment for us. We often talk about the mix of our business being leaning towards industrial with about 60% industrial and 25% retail, but the reality is we still believe in the health of the LTL industry long-term. And we think we're better positioned than anyone in this space. And so I think we've got tremendous market share opportunities. We're seeing good growth with our customers in the industrial space, but we're also seeing there's probably more growth with our retail oriented customers here in the quarter. And I think that gets back to the fact that supply chains are becoming more sophisticated. And when shippers are looking for someone to provide consistent, on-time and claims free services, they're meeting tighter delivery times and appointment times into distribution centers, we certainly fill that need and we've got increased demand there. So we feel like we've got tremendous opportunity to continue to increase our market share and the fact that getting back to the investments that we have made, it's for long-term capacity because we believe in our long-term growth capabilities. Ariel Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Terrific. Thanks for the time. Operator : David Ross with Stifel. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the evolution there, Earl, David and Greg, your respective roles. With the truck orders coming up by few hundred trucks Adam, did you place those orders in 1Q and do you feel because of the rush for orders and the order book filling up and the backlog increasing that you essentially had to place all of them in 1Q? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: We actually had put them in earlier with the others and we were kind of ... David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: In order to get the slots. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: That's right. We sort of had them out there as a contingency with the idea that we would evaluate what our volume trends were. And you know continuing to look out at how our growth in the current period was and what we thought we might continue to achieve in the back half of this year into 2019 and what replacement cycle would be there. So on the tractor side that was the case. On the trailer side, that was a more recent type of thing and just looking at basically the capacity and mainly this is going to be designated in our van pool, but just looking at what our trailing equipment capacity was and where we were continuing to see some rentals in some places and just felt the need that this fits within the operation and certainly made sense to go ahead and get the orders in if we could. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And with the tight capacity environment, is there any more noise being made about I guess resurrecting the twin 33 conversation in D.C.? Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Not from Old Dominion. We studied twin 33s and just honestly could not \u2013 once we got really deep into our study, we see some lanes where they can help us, but we're not going to be a strong proponent but we're not against them either. If someone else wants to fight the fight, they can and we'll figure out how and where we can make the most use of them if they come to pass, but we're not going be a strong proponent of it, D.C. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, thanks. Morning, guys. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Morning, Scott. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Adam, I don't think I heard March year-over-year tonnage and then I don't know if you can give an update on April revenue per hundredweight. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: The March year-over-year tons was \u2013 it was 14.6% and I didn't give an update on the revenue per hundredweight, but it's, with the fuel, was trending at about where we were in the first quarter. So kind of in that 6% range but that'll be something \u2013 we should give that in our 10-Q as well. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Helpful. How should we think about oil at a multi-year high? Is that still an earnings tailwind for you? Does it help or hurt incremental margins? Can you just give us a reminder about how to think about oil here? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I mean oil just \u2013 I mean it's \u2013 becomes a variable component of pricing [Technical Difficulty] (00:51:04) fuel surcharge and then you've got the cost increase. Typically what you'll see when fuel is rising is our labor cost as a percent of revenue, we'll see a benefit. But then you've got the offsetting increases in fuel and other petroleum related products and that's primarily why we look at our total direct operating cost all sort of combined in one. Perhaps it gives the appearance when you consider the overhead types of cost if you've got a little bit more fuel surcharge revenue in one period versus another, but we try to look at all the components of both revenue and the cost streams that go into our account profitability and costing model. And those are one of the \u2013 that's just one of many elements that we have to consider when it comes to the customer profitability. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : But is rising oil still the net earnings benefit it used to be or not as much anymore? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I don't know that that would be the case because obviously we've got the \u2013 we're going to have our cost increasing as well. And we've looked at our fuel surcharge table a couple of years ago when the fuel was decreasing. And we went out and tried to look at the way the table works both on the lower end and in a rising environment as well to make sure that we've got a surcharge program in place that helps us meet our profitability objectives wherever fuel is in any particular band. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Makes sense. And then just last one real quick. I know you guys typically do \u2013 I think you do mid-year wage increases. Given the labor market, do you feel like you have to do a higher than normal increase this year or is it going to be sort of typical? David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I would say it would probably be typical. We haven't talked a whole lot about that. We give our increase the first week of September, but we're still a few months off it. We'll start to look at it over the next couple of months and make a decision from there, but we're not there yet. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you for the time, guys. Operator : Willard Milby of Seaport Global has our next question. Willard Milby - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hey good morning, everybody. So with the upping of the CapEx and the trailers and kind of hiring to meet demand, would you think that you're going to have to step up hiring or would \u2013 if you had the opportunity to hire at will, would you think you'd have the same step-up in the second half of this year that you might have seen in the second half of 2017? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Keep in mind the second half of 2017 we got behind the curve a little bit and the growth really stepped up as we progressed. We weren't really growing or we grew at 6.5% I think our revenue in the first quarter and that stepped up to 11% to 12% in the second and third quarters and then stepped up again in the fourth. So I think we talked about the fact that we had to hire quite a bit in the back half of the year including the fourth quarter, which normally wouldn't happen. So I think we've got our workforce in good shape right now with where we are and our head count was a little bit higher than our shipment growth, which those two numbers are more closely aligned. It's the shipments not necessarily the tonnage that we're basing things on, but the hiring decision comes down to the managers in the local markets. They know what growth they think they will be able to achieve and so we monitor labor to revenue trends very closely, but we want to make sure that we've got people in place to be able to make pickups and deliveries to keep rate moving. So I think that we anticipated seeing the numbers, the growth in head count more closely aligned with shipment counts this year, it's what we saw in the first quarter, and it's probably what you'll see as we continue to progress through the year. Willard Milby - Seaport Global Securities LLC : All right. Thanks very much. And if I could kind of go back to the Scott's question on the driver wages. You're talking about 4% to 4.5% to cover your cost increases on these accounts and I'm assuming the drivers are the biggest bucket there. Is there not a step up from the historical 3% to 3.5% rate you might have been putting in with driver increases and can you talk about what, I guess, the second biggest bucket of that cost inflation is? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Salaries, wages and benefits are the biggest element. And then the fuel and operate supplies. And you know when I was talking about breaking down our operating ratio earlier, those direct operating costs including purchase transportation and operating taxes and insurance, and so forth are 60% to 65% as a percent of revenue whereas overhead is in the 20% to 25% range. So it's wage and benefit cost which we anticipated the inflation and that went into that 4% to 4.5% number as well as all the other incremental operating supplies, general supplies and other overhead categories as well. Willard Milby - Seaport Global Securities LLC : All right. Thanks for the time guys. Operator : And next we'll hear from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. Hey you guys upped the CapEx on the rolling stock side, but I'm curious about the real estate side. So obviously you got a $200 million, that's a big budget, but how are you feeling about actually being able to deploy that capital? So I guess my question is you've got a really tight industrial real estate market, at a time seems to be a very difficult permitting environment in some parts of the country, are you having success finding the land parcels that you guys need to grow? Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Yeah. We have some locations where we're having issues, but yes we're having some success as well. We do have a very aggressive CapEx on that side as you know and we are executing. So we were looking at potential increases in our door counts this morning and it looks like it could definitely be significant, but we have numerous facilities under construction now that should open within the next one to three, four, five months and then we are purchasing quite a bit of property. So we're having success but there are locations where it's a little more difficult and it's expensive. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Far more so than it used to be. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. Yeah, no that's for sure. There's no doubt about that, but how much of the budget is simple door expansions at existing facilities and how much of it is actually going out and buying let's say a parcel and developing a greenfield site? Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: It's more so \u2013 I don't know that we've looked at that specifically, but it's more so on the property side right now than additional doors; a lot of the doors, a lot of the money that we have in there for doors actually was started last year. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Okay that's helpful. Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Those properties are in the process of finishing, as we speak. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: And Tyler, we started the year with 228 facilities and felt like we'd open somewhere between 7 to 10 service centers here and probably increase our door capacity more than we have in many years as well. And some of that, that continuation of projects that really just fell over from last year into the early part of this one that Greg just mentioned. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. No, that's very helpful. And then Adam maybe going back to the salaries and wage line, but it seems like you got a really noisy year this year. I mean we've got that PPO change, I think you mentioned Phantom Stock 401(k) match. I think you had a really good healthcare experience last year, if I'm not mistaken. And I think you have obviously the wage increases, but can you talk about all in total salaries, wages and benefits. What you expect that type of unit cost inflation to be? I'm assuming that's going to be north of the 4% to 4.5%? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I don't necessarily want to give that level of detail, but what I'll give you and what we normally put in our 10-Q is that our fringe benefit rate which is our fringe benefit cost as a percent of salaries and wages, it's typically about \u2013 or last year it's just a little under 34% and that number was about 35.5% in the first quarter of 2018. So when you do the math on that, that was an incremental $7 million. If you just use the rate that we had in the first quarter last year, $7 million of extra cost and we had some pluses and minuses that went in there and the few that I've already mentioned, but there's a lot of things that go in there with respect to payroll taxes and health trends which continue to be favorable in the first quarter of this year. Workers' compensation was good. So I mean it's a hodgepodge of cost and I do think that that number, all right, expect to see it reduce in future periods back to more the 34%, 34.5% of salaries and wages is where I'd like to see it. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Now that's very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. I will turn the conference back over to David for any additional or closing comments. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: We'd like to thank all of you for your participation today. Great questions and please feel free to call us if we can answer anything further. Thanks and have a great day. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to the company's Executive Chairman, Mr. David Congdon. Please go ahead, sir. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Good morning and welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me today are Greg Gantt, our President and CEO; Adam Satterfield, our CFO. And after our brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion's financial results for the second quarter were exceptional. We produced strong, balanced growth in revenue which drove substantial profitable growth for the quarter. Even with our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in shipments and a 16% increase in employees, our service metrics remain outstanding, with on-time delivery of 99% and a cargo claim ratio of 0.2%. We also broke new ground in terms of our operating leverage by delivering an all-time record operating ratio for Old Dominion of 78.7%. In second quarter, we were able to build on the strong operating momentum that we experienced in the first quarter. Based on trends thus far into the third quarter, we believe conditions are favorable to achieve further profitable growth in the second half of 2018. The ongoing expansion of the U.S. economy, along with positive metrics across nearly all economic indicators, no doubt supports a positive business environment. Feedback that we have received from our customers about their businesses also remains very encouraging and is reflected in their increasing demand for our services. Pricing environment also continues to be attractive in an industry that remains capacity-constrained and where carriers increasingly recognize the need for stronger margins to support their capital expenditures. As a result of our strong first half performance and the continuing positive macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our market position moving into the second half of 2018 and beyond. In addition, and as expected, the planned transition within our executive management team has gone very well. Greg has embraced the new responsibilities in his combined role of President and CEO, and our quarterly results under his leadership and that of our entire management team certainly speak for themselves. Thank you for your interest in Old Dominion, and now here is Greg to discuss the second quarter in more detail. Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Thanks, David, and good morning to all. Old Dominion's results for the second quarter are a case study for the power of our business model. The basic formula of increasing freight density and yield once again help drive significant operating leverage for the quarter. What our financial results and operating statistics don't show is the tremendous effort by each of our employees to provide the superior service that enables this model to work so well. I want to recognize everyone in the OD family and thank them for their innovation, flexibility, and commitment to delivering our value proposition of on-time, claims-free service at a fair price. The effort of our employees over the last three quarters has been particularly impressive as the growth in our revenue per day surged in late September of last year and now exceeds 20%. Our growth in LTL shipments per day has been in the double digit range over the past three quarters as well. We believe the market share gains inherent in these growth rates reflect an acceleration in demand among existing and new customers for our superior service, which enables shippers to have a high degree of confidence that their freight will be delivered on time and claims free. As we've discussed in previous quarters, we have been steadily adding to our workforce to prepare for this anticipated growth. Of the almost 3,000 new employees added over the past year, nearly a third of this total were added in the second quarter of 2018. We believe the culture within our company has allowed us to attract and retain these new team members who are critical to reaching our goals of increased market share over the long-term. Working to achieve our long-term goals will require the consistent execution of our strategic plan. We rely on each of our employees, both new and long tenured to maintain that long-term consistency of our service performance. I can tell you that is not as easy as we may make it look to produce the strong on-time and cargo claims results that David mentioned, especially with double-digit shipment growth. Although we have lost some productivity in our dock and P&D operations as compared to the second quarter of last year, our line haul laid and load average actually improved, and our operations remain very efficient overall as evidenced by our operating ratio. While our number one priority will continue to be maintaining our superior service and meeting our promises to our customers, I am confident that we will also regain this lost productivity in due time. In the second quarter, we also continued to support our value proposition through our capital expenditure strategy, which is designed to ensure that we always have the capacity and the people to deliver on our commitments to our customers while also winning market share. This philosophy and the level of our expenditures differentiate Old Dominion in the LTL industry just as clearly as our superior service and pricing philosophy; all are key contributors to the long-term nature of our historically successful financial performance. We have often told you that we believe Old Dominion is uniquely positioned in the LTL industry just as clearly as our superior service and pricing philosophy. All are key contributors to the long-term nature of our historically successful financial performance. We have also told you that we believe Old Dominion is uniquely positioned in the LTL industry to continue expanding our market share. We think that our operating and financial results for the second quarter and the first half of 2018 should add further support to this statement. We also believe favorable industry dynamics remain in place for our market share growth to continue. With ongoing execution of our business strategies, we remain confident that Old Dominion is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that we have for growth while also increasing shareholder value. Thanks for being with us this morning and for your interest in Old Dominion. Now, here's Adam to review our second quarter numbers in greater detail. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Thank you, Greg, good morning. Old Dominion set many new company records during the second quarter and perhaps one for the industry with respect to our operating ratio. Our revenue grew 23% to $1 billion, and our operating ratio improved to 78.7%, which is the first quarter that we have ever achieved a sub-80% operating ratio. The combination of these factors allowed us to increase our income before tax by 38.2%. Earnings per diluted share also benefited from a lower effective tax rate and increased 67.2% to $1.99. Revenue growth for the second quarter, included increases in both LTL volumes and yield, both of which were supported by the strength of the domestic economy and general tightness in capacity within the transportation industry. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 7.4% and increased 4.1% when excluding fuel surcharges. Our LTL tons per day increased 14.6% as compared to the second quarter of 2017 with LTL shipments per day increasing 11.2% and LTL weight per shipment increasing 3.1%. On a sequential basis, second quarter LTL shipments increased 9.3% over the first quarter of 2018 as compared to a 10-year average sequential increase of 7.0%. LTL tons per day increased 8.3%, which is-in line with the 10-year average sequential change for this metric. Our LTL shipment growth remained strong. Our LTL weight per shipment decreased slightly during the quarter. I believe this weight per shipment trend was based more on changes with the mix of our freight and should not be interpreted as a negative read on the economy. In support for this belief, we note that 16 of our top 50 customer accounts had a decrease in weight per shipment during the quarter but those same accounts had an average increase in revenue of 46%. Month-to-date July volumes as compared to July 2017 currently include an increase in LTL weight per day of between 11% to 11.5% percent and an increase in LTL shipments per day of approximately 11%. Convergence in tonnage and shipment reflects the impact of changes in LTL weight per shipment that I just mentioned as well as other initiatives that we have taken to prevent heavy-weighted items from taking up too much of our capacity. The good news is that our yield continues to show strength, and as a result, the growth in revenue per day for July is trending in the same range as that of the second quarter. The operating ratio for the second quarter improved 220 basis points, with improvement in both our direct operating costs and overhead expenses as a percent of revenue. Overhead-related costs as a percent revenue, notably our depreciation in general supplies and expenses improved 160 basis points due to the quality of our revenue growth as well as our focus on controlling cost. In our direct operating cost, we note that salaries, wages and benefits improved 210 basis points when compared to the second quarter 2017, but our operating supplies and expenses increased 150 basis points due to the rising cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products. Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $213.4 million and $424.7 million for the second quarter and first half of 2018, respectively. Capital expenditures were $191.7 million for the second quarter and $292.3 million for the first half of 2018. We continue to expect total capital expenditures of approximately $555 million for the year, subject to the timing of certain real estate projects. We returned $40.8 million of capital to shareholders during the second quarter, including $30.1 million of share repurchases. Total amount of shares repurchased and dividends paid for the first half of 2018 was $68.8 million. Our annual effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 was 26.2% as compared to 38.6% in the second quarter of 2017, due primarily to the positive impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. We're currently anticipating an effective tax rate of 26.2% for the third quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. I will note however that we're in different places this morning, so please forgive us for any stumbles as we start addressing your questions. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go first to Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. So, Adam, can you help elaborate on the weight per shipment decrease and kind of what is driving that? Is that a deliberate shift in the mix of freight? Is that more e-commerce? Is it kind of \u2013 what's the broader trend there? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Not necessarily a deliberate shift. I think what we're seeing is that we are growing significantly with certain customers, and like I mentioned in our top 50 customers, we've got certain accounts that were growing revenues significantly, so we're picking up maybe in different states and different distribution centers that we're serving. But it's the same account, and it may just be a different mix of freight in certain cases. So, that's one element of the change that we're seeing. We've made some changes in certain places and with certain pricing initiatives to also prevent some of the very heavy-weighted items that we were seeing to a small scale to make sure that we don't have significant weighted items taking up too much of our capacity. We want to make sure that we're continuing to handle LTL freight and not truckload freight and so that has been intentional. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And just pivoting to your comments on your overall growth and then the fact that you're picking up share, where is the share coming from? Do you have a sense of that? Is it coming from your bigger competitors? Is it coming from mom-and-pops? Is it coming from LTL as a whole picking up share within the different transportation modalities or is it coming from brokers as shippers kind of move more to asset-based carriers? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: The short answer is yes. It's coming from all the above. But, no, seriously, we are seeing good growth across \u2013 really all areas of the country for us. Each of our regions seeing nice growth consistent with what we've talked about in recent quarters. And most of the areas that we've been adding capacity, we've been seeing a little bit more growth and the Midwest is a good example of that, and I think the Midwest growth also reflects the improvement that we've seen in the industrial economy. When you look at certain macroeconomic numbers obviously with respect to the industrial economy, they're all firing on all cylinders and we're certainly seeing that with our own numbers and hearing it as well from our customers. I will add though that we are starting to see good growth with retail-oriented customers, and for the second quarter in a row, our customers that have an SIC Code that we attribute to retail, we're seeing growth of about 28% or we saw a growth of about 28% in the second quarter, so growing a little bit faster than the overall company average. And I think this, to your first question, may hit on the fact that if you believe in \u2013 that there will be long-term secular shift of freight from different modes of transportation coming into the LTL industry, which we believe we're seeing some of that happening now. It's not going to be an overnight type of change, but it's certainly something that we're seeing and something that we're capitalizing on as well. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And just, lastly, kind of given the strength of the current macro environment, kind of barring some kind of trade or tariff dislocation or recession or something, it does appear to be sustainable for a while. So are you planning to revisit your pricing strategy in terms of the timing of your GRIs or the kind of size of the GRIs relative to peers? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Well, we just had our GRI effective the beginning of June, and that compares to the prior year. It was at the beginning of September, so I think we've had a long-term pricing philosophy at the company that has worked out well and obviously has been very key to our results over the long run; and that's, one, to have pricing in place, to achieve profitability on a customer-by-customer basis that is designed to offset the cost increases that we face as a company, the cost to handling each individual customer shipments as well as supporting the reinvestments that we need to make in our business, particularly on the real estate side as well as the increase in technology demands that our customers have for us. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Thanks, everybody, and congrats on the solid results. Adam, when I look historically at the sequential move in OR from 2Q to 3Q, you do see a step-up but it's not really that significant, 50 basis points or under for the last several years. So, if that trend holds, I guess, there's an implied acceleration in incremental margins as you move from the very strong results in 2Q to 3Q. It looks like something like over 32% in the third quarter. So is it right to assume some acceleration incrementals in the back half of the year, given that trend and the pricing backdrop? Because volumes are also, I would argue, obviously slowing and coming up against different comps, if you could just help us think about that? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Yeah. Well, we'll repeat what we've said that we don't necessarily manage the company at the incremental margins. Certainly, when we talk about the long-term, we'll still continue to say that 20% to 25% is kind of what we target. We'll probably use that range until our operating ratio approaches to 75%, which is somewhat looks that way. But obviously what we produced here in the second quarter shows the power of our model and we've talked about it when you pull apart our operating ratio and look at the breakdown between direct operating cost and overhead. Obviously, we achieved strong quality revenue growth in this quarter and we're able to get tremendous leverage on our overhead cost but we continue to show good improvement with our direct cost as well and that's in our salary, wages and benefit; in the operating supplies and expenses. So we'll continue to focus on improving those costs, if we can get those improvements, and with those costs being around 60% or a little north to there, then certainly we can have quarters where we've got an incremental that's 30% and we've done quarters where it's been above that. And we don't give a certain range for each quarter as guidance per se, but certainly we're focused on bringing consistent quality revenue growth into the company, and I think that based on what the macro economy is showing and the customer demand that we hear every day, we've got tremendous opportunity to continue to show accelerated revenue growth and we're focused on putting as much of those dollars of revenue that we grow to the bottom line. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And so if I \u2013 just a follow-on to that, talking about OpEx leverage. I mean, historically, you've talked about operating expenses per shipment kind of in that 4% to 4.5% range. And I think the first half it's been closer to kind of that 7% to 8% range. As the business grows, I mean, is there an ability to further leverage \u2013 I mean, I guess there is, but can you get down to 4.5% or is maybe the OpEx per shipment level kind of for this year and that 7% to 8% is kind of more the right number to target? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Well, if you back fuel out, which is just one cost element, we did move closer to 5% in the second quarter. And if you recall in the first quarter, we had a little bit of the acceleration in benefit cost and some other things. And then we had the productivity challenges as well that put us more in that 7% range. What we're seeing is these fuel prices have increased significantly. It's not only the increase in fuel but we're seeing petroleum-based product costs increasing as well, and that's driving some of that increase in our operating supplies and expenses as a percent of revenue that we saw on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So, that's one element. Certainly, we're going to continue to focus on improving productivity and I think we've got opportunities there as well. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Okay. Those are my two. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Brad Delco with Stephens, Inc. Brad Delco - Stephens, Inc.: David, Adam, Greg, good morning. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Good morning. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Hey, Brad. Brad Delco - Stephens, Inc.: Maybe for Greg. Looking sequentially, shipments increased 9.4% \u2013 or 9.3%. I think, Adam, you said that's a little bit better than historical averages, and your employee count improved or increased 4.7%, so you did get a lot of good leverage on your workforce. Greg, you mentioned that you lost some dock and labor productivity. Like how do we think about the employee count going forward relative to your expected shipment growth? And maybe what exactly are the areas for improvement on some of those productivity challenges you're having with the labor force? Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Okay. Well, obviously, Brad, as you can see, we have added a lot of folks to the workforce, particularly on the platform and in our P&D and long haul operations. But we were a little behind, if you will. With the surging growth that we've had, we obviously had to ramp up our hiring efforts, and fortunately we were able to add to the force as needed and where needed, so I'm happy that we've been able to do that. Going forward, I don't see quite the need that we've had. We've got two peak months, a couple of peak months coming up. We went through a big month at the end of the second quarter in June. But I think we've got a couple of peaks yet to deal with, but we're much closer to the desired number of folks that we need than we had been in the past, so I feel good about where we are. I think you'll see those hirings level out quite a bit from here forward. There will still be some in some locations where we have some needs, but much less than what we did through the second quarter. Brad Delco - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. So sort of more in-line with the sequential trend in shipments I guess is the thought here? Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Yes, Brad. Yes. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Brad, I'd like to add, this is David \u2013 that the timeframe it takes for an employee that comes on our dock to really learn our systems, the technology side of it and to really learn the OD way of moving freight and packing trailers and delivering a claim-free delivery, it takes time to reach a full level of productivity. I'd venture it's at least six months \u2013 six to nine months to really get fully up to speed with a tenured employee. So with all these folks that we've added, nearly a third of 3,000, nearly 900 in just this most recent quarter, it's going to take a little while. We should be able to get some of our lost productivity in terms of shipments per hour and pounds per hour back both in the \u2013 primarily the dock, but the P&D as well. Brad Delco - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. So, really, the issues are just new employees and them needing to ramp. And then maybe just sort of the second question, thinking about productivity and sort of your incremental capacity with your assets, where are your sort of load averages running now versus to the extent you can give us a historical context. Are these load averages as good as you've seen them or do you think you still have room to optimize the freight in the trailers? Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I think they're fairly close to some of our better quarters in the past. I'm not looking at those numbers right in front of me but, yes, they're pretty much near our historical peaks, if I recall. But we do have some room, Brad. There's always room for improvement in that area. When you talk about 8,000 and 9,000 closes a day, absolutely. There's always opportunity to make improvements in that area. Brad Delco - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Well, guys, thanks for the time. I appreciate it and congrats on the good quarter. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Thanks, Brad. Operator : We'll go next to Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Unknown Speaker : (00:28:35) Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : So, Adam, can you give us the monthly sequential tonnage trends and then sort of how July is tracking and then maybe normal seasonality? And then, just on the revenue comment that it's up the same in July as you saw in second quarter, so I guess that implies double-digit yields growth. I just want to confirm that that's right. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: That's right. On the yield side and we saw this with June, as well as the weight per shipment as we've been facing 4% or close in the high 3%s increase in weight per shipment; certainly that's had a negative effect on our reported revenue per hundredweight. So as the weight per shipment is now becoming a little more normalized, you don't have that same type of negative pressure and we're getting more yield as a result. On the sequential changes for the second quarter, for tons, April was up 2.4% over March; May was up 3.1% over April, and June was up 2.5% over May and that compares to the 10-year average April of 0.7%; May 4.1%; and June 2.3%. On the shipment that was \u2013 wait. On the shipments, we had April was up 3.6%; May was up 2.5% and June was up 2.2% over May. That compares to the 10-year average, which is April increasing 0.6%; May increasing 3.4% and June increasing 1.4%. And recall the April and May trends were a little different versus the 10-year average with the timing of Good Friday this year, but just that last metric there, you can see that we're still getting tremendous increase in shipments and that June, up 2.2% versus the 1.4%. We're getting the throughput of shipments; we're just seeing a little bit of decrease in shipment size. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : And can you talk sequential for July or because it's not a full month and you can't really talk about it yet? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Well, it's not a full month at this point, but what I'll tell you is that basically what we talked about of the shipments are somewhere around 11%. That's pretty consistent with the year-over-year growth that we saw in shipment count on May and June. And then, the weight is trending up. So right now, we're pretty much in-line with sequentials on the shipment side and the weight is just seeing that a little bit more decrease in weight per shipment from June into July than what we normally might see, but as I mentioned before, some of that is intentional and is the result of actions that we have taken. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just my last question, when you do a sub-80% OR for a quarter do you think that that's a place that you can do? Can you do a full year sub-80% in the next couple of years? Do you think that's realistic? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I guess we'll see what happens. As my former mentor used to say, we don't give guidance. But I think that when we talk about incremental margins, we've averaged at 25% since 2010 and you can see what the power of the model is doing. We've had \u2013 going back to the second quarter of last year, each quarter since that time we've seen above-normal revenue growth. And so as we continue to get the strength in our revenue that's coming through, we're taking advantage of these multiyear investments that we made in capacity. They're certainly operating leverage in the model and we've long talked about that the two key ingredients \u2013 the long-term margin performance are density and yield. And so we're certainly getting the density. The yield environment continues to be very strong. We're getting the increases that we need from our customers and both require the support of positive macro environment. And certainly everything we see and read continues to be extremely positive. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Scott, this is David, I'd like to just add to this. We had what we call the \u2013 a good, balanced growth for the second quarter and that implies a lot of things. One is just it's of the mix of business that we have, customers we have, the levels of pricing we have within each individual account. The fact that we are growing multiple shipment shippers and we're growing multiple shipments with those shippers is just, I mean, every measure of density you see across our network is good with just a rock solid customer base and a rock solid pricing philosophy that's going to carry forward as we keep growing in the future. But this economy right now is \u2013 it's got to be the best out there I can remember in my career right now. When you look across nearly every economic indicator \u2013 from the inventory sales ratios, GDP, industrial production, ISM, construction spending, retail sales, you name it the macro economy is strong and certainly, we do \u2013 everyone's \u2013 there's a notion out there in the most recent days that we've reached some kind of a peak and everything's going to go to hell or something, I don't know but I don't believe it. I think if trucking has been a leading indicator of an economy we're just not seeing any weakness, and when you look at the tonnage index (00:35:32) is putting out right now, that is rock solid. So it's the entire industry, continues to be strong and we're just not seeing any notion of peak in the economy right now and certainly no notion of peak when it comes to Old Dominion. We have a proven history of being able to power our way through any economic cycle. But right now, the stars could not be any better aligned for future profitable growth at Old Dominion. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Appreciate the time and color. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to touch on CapEx a bit. You maintained the budget for 2018. But when you look out to 2019, pretty strong comments on the macro backdrop right there. But also looking at current capacity, how do you see that shaping up in terms of spend in 2019? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: We haven't formulated what we think our plan will be from a capacity standpoint in our real estate network. We're continuing to see, on average, capacity within the \u2013 probably in the 15% to 20% range, and maybe it's on the low end of that scale. We've opened three service centers thus far this year and we've got several more that should be opening soon and may end up opening a total of up to 10 this year. We started the year with 228. We've historically been spending somewhere 12% to 15% of our revenue on our capital expenditures. And certainly, the most important piece of that CapEx budget has been what we're doing from a real estate standpoint. We've got a long-term plan of adding another 35 to 40 centers, at least based on what we think today and where we think we can grow the company to in the future and we're going to continue to execute on those plans and if we find availability, certainly we would intend to jump on that strategically. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you. Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Just to add to that \u2013 this is Greg. We have a lot of property purchases in 2018 that should become construction cost in 2019. We expect it to be similar but we'll have to wait and see where it shakes out. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Sure. Okay. That's helpful. And one on market share, thinking a little bit longer-term here, obviously this year it seems like you're picking up big gains in share. But what should we think about as a longer-term target on overall market share and any guidance on timeline or goals that you've set for yourself in getting there? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: We haven't put anything out at this point in terms of what our next long-term target is. I think based on where we're trending from a revenue standpoint, we're probably somewhere in the 10% to 10.5% market share range, but we feel really good about our opportunities. One, I feel like the LTL industry, in particular, is the best industry within transportation suited for long-term growth and I think that we're better positioned than anyone to capture our share of that growth going forward, and certainly that's what our intention is and how we've executed over the long-term. So, we feel good about that standpoint and we don't necessarily see any type of metric that we think \u2013 that we can only get to in stock. We've got better service. We're continuing to give our superior service at a fair price and we're adding capacity every day to the network to be able to continue to grow and meet the demand \u2013 the ever-increasing demand of our customers. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: We have no notion of peak. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll go next to Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just to come back to the conversation around the weight per shipment, understanding that that's something that you're focused on, is that \u2013 was that based on looking at just the profitability of some of those shipments relative to where you would want your margin profile to be? And can you talk about kind of the timing? Do you think that you saw most of the benefit of that in the second quarter from a margin perspective or is that something that should continue to build as you move through the rest of the year? David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I'll say, Todd, what it was is there has definitely been some falloff of truckload into LTL with customers breaking up large shipments \u2013 I mean, full truckloads into large LTL shipments and we've been very careful to not bog our network \u2013 bog our capacity down with too many of these large LTL spot quote-type shipments because we've had such an increasing demand from our LTL shippers to handle more and more of their freight. And so what we refer to on that weight per shipment focus was that we have intentionally raised our pricing on spot quote, large LTL spot quote-type, right, in order to discourage it so that we would have the capacity for our smaller shippers and that has contributed to the flattening of our LTL weight per shipment. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Okay. That makes perfect sense. Thanks for the help with that. And then just, Adam, for the second quarter on the cost side, I mean I understand that the fuel was moving up and there were some productivity, maybe some inefficiencies or not full productivity of some of the new hires, is there anything that you would call out maybe that worked in your favor during the second quarter that wouldn't be recurring as you move into the third quarter as we think about margin sequentially or was it just a situation where you did get the leverage that you'd expect, and from a cost standpoint, it was a good cost quarter? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I think it was a good cost quarter just overall. One thing that came in a little bit more favorable than perhaps what we anticipated was we had a really good benefit cost performance, we continue to see increases that we expected with the changes that we've talked for a couple of quarters about with respect to the vacation change that we improved this year for our employees as well as some of the performance-based compensation as well. But we had some really positive trends overall with health claims and with workers' comp as well; that there's a lot of numbers that kind of go into that overall benefit cost. But that dropped a little bit lower. It's approximately a little bit around 33% of salaries and wages, which was normalized compared to basically the same as the second quarter of last year, but from a sequential standpoint, was better than what our first quarter performance was. And given the increases that we anticipated, I think I made a comment on our last quarter call that I anticipated those costs being somewhere around 34% of salaries and wages, more in-line with what we have seen for the full year in 2017. But otherwise I think we've talked a little bit in the first quarter as well and it's part of the reason we had the 520-basis-point improvement from first quarter and the second quarter is that it's a little stronger than normal. But in the first quarter, they weren't material items to call out, but it just seemed like we had a little bit higher miscellaneous expenses, a little bit higher things here and there, whereas some of those were more in-line with what we would expect going forward, so nothing really material to call out other than we did have that slight improvement sequentially in the benefit rate. Todd C. Fowler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good. Okay. Yeah. That helps. I remember that from one 1Q and seeing that reverse here into 2Q makes sense sequentially. So, okay, thanks a lot for the time this morning, guys. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Thanks, Todd. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment Research : I wanted to touch a little bit on breaking down the yield. You mentioned that, Adam, I think, that yields are running kind of in that double-digit range in July. I just want to get a sense how do you think about pricing in this context? It's been accelerating sort of the revenue per hundredweight without fuel the last couple of quarters. Do you see that sort of trend to continue as you go into the back half of the year and things getting stronger against relatively neutral comps? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Certainly, we have every intention to improve our yields and this is the environment. If you can't get an increase now, I don't know when you will get it but we've been addressing underperforming accounts. We put our GRI in in the beginning of June and that certainly helped that metric improve, what we had reported from a quarter-to-date number through May with our mid-quarter update than what we ended up producing for the second quarter. So, as I mentioned earlier, that weight per shipment in July right now, weight per shipment is about the same as where we were in July of last year, so that is normalized, and I'd mentioned what \u2013 the weight per day, how that's trending, so you can kind of back into what the overall revenue per hundredweight is with the fuel. But revenue performance continues to be very strong, and some of this is \u2013 it's not all just the fact that fuel is increasing. With some accounts, we've had to address the fuel tables for the account and that's a yield performance and management initiative that we've taken. So, I mean we're looking across all the elements \u2013 the philosophy that we follow is looking at the revenue inputs for each customer and what those cost inputs may be as well. We're trying to improve the operating ratio for each individual accounting. And that's what our pricing department is doing a fantastic job of right now. Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment Research : Okay. That's helpful. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I had two. There's maybe \u2013 no, go ahead. Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment Research : No, no \u2013 go ahead, Adam. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I'm just going to say that just because it's a favorable environment, we once again will commend our sales team who's out every day, meeting with our customers and working through their initiatives and building these relationships and so forth, and they're the ones going out and obtaining these increases. They're just not being willingly handed to us, so it's certainly a favorable environment. But the freight doesn't just fall on the truck and these increases in rates just don't materialize out of thin air, so I think we've got to commend each and every one of our employees that are out giving service and getting these increases that we need. Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment Research : Okay. No, that's very helpful. And I guess when you look historically or even just looking at the second quarter, typically revenue per hundredweight without fuel account for more than 50% of surface with fuel increase. Is that type of relationship should still hold or do you think because some of the actions you're doing on the fuel side, if you're getting, say, 10% revenue per hundredweight with fuel that it would be less than half? I'm just trying to get a \u2013 that's a rough sense of sort of where that x-fuel number shakes out within it. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I honestly don't go through and look at the variation between the with and without. Really, the thing we pay attention to the most is the revenue per hundredweight with fuel and then what our cost per shipment with fuel, how those two are trending and we've got to have a positive variance there to ensure that we can continue to improve our operating ratio and support the reinvestments in our business. And so in the second quarter revenue per shipment, I may have said hundredweight, but revenue per shipment was up 10.7% and our cost per shipment were up 7.6%, and that's all inclusive of fuel. But certainly, we've got that \u2013 that positive variance there in the second quarter. And we would like to say that that can continue, but realistically over the long run, when you look, going back for multiple years, we've had a positive increase in revenue per shipment of about 4.8% and our cost per shipment have trended up 4%, so it's that positive delta there that again helps us contribute to the improvement in the operating ratio but also support all of these capacity investments we continue to make. Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment Research : Okay. No, that's helpful. And then, just one point on that capacity. David, it sounds like you were thinking that the cycle still has some room to grow here. So from a capacity addition standpoint, when you look out the next 6, 12 or maybe 18 months so when you're doing your planning, are you changing sort of the pace of that growth at all or is it kind of still steaming ahead the way you have over the course of the last year and a half, two years? David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: They were continuing to steam ahead. Adam mentioned earlier 15% to 20% capacity in the network, but we continue to find ourselves in certain of the larger metropolitan areas where our door pressure is getting so high that we are basically out of capacity, and those are generally the places where we're either adding doors or we're looking to spin off into a new location in a major metro area and have multiple service centers there. So we just have to stay ahead of it and do the best job we can forecasting where we're going to be reaching capacity limits and try to take action with our growth in those places. But we haven't seen much let-up in our real estate department in I don't know how many in the last 10 years, and it just seems like it's still a very busy department and we anticipate having a lot of activity in the next few years to come. I mean, here we are with 10% market share; there is 90% out there for us to go after so we'll just keep on growing and keep making hay while the sun is shining on our service. Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment Research : Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks for the time this morning. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll go next to David Ross with Stifel. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Hello, David. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Good morning, David. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: We haven't talked about the IT conversion in a while. And, Adam, I guess the last we spoke, it was on track but maybe taking a little bit longer than expected. Where do you stand on that process? And then you mentioned earlier in the call that you're investing to keep up with the increased IT demand that customers have. Could you talk a little bit more about what those demands are and what customers are requiring from their carriers these days? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Sure. That may be easier to address. This is \u2013 it's not necessarily anything new but certainly changing where customers, just more and more they want real-time data, data connectivity into our systems and I think the better system connections that we can build with our customers, the stronger relationships that we build with those customers as well. And it's anything and everything \u2013 from freight visibility to billing information and so forth. And, again, the better we can do from that standpoint, perhaps the stickier we are with our customers. And it helps us, too, from overall cost performance standpoint. From just the general state of our technology department, yeah, we had his multiyear project going on. We kind of paused last year and I think we talked about this a little bit. We've changed leaders in that department and I think we're starting to make some real good progress on certain things. We've done a lot of work of getting our technology infrastructure built out in different data centers and in different places of the country, building in some redundancies and certainly look into add as much as technology efficiency that we can within each area of the company. And whether that's our operations out in the field, which most of our systems are homegrown as well as the back-office operations here in the corporate office, so we're going to continue to make progress there as best we can. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Is there anything specifically the customers are asking for that you're investing in or that you might be doing better than others or...? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I think the thing that we're probably doing better than others on, really, gets to our operating systems. And that's everything from our route planning technologies, load planning technologies, everything as it relates to move in freight through the system. And certainly that's been something that we've been focused on for many, many years and now we're on different generations of handhelds. We're rolling out now an updated generation for our driver handheld systems, and we're always working on different tweaks and so forth to continue to drive improvement there in the field as it relates to moving freight but also as we can maybe drive some efficiency and some automation into certain processes here at the corporate office. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: (00:54:54). Greg, real quick, you've done pretty much every job there is in a trucking company, so how does the new CEO role meet your expectations or how is it different than you thought it would be? Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I don't think it's a whole lot different than I thought it would be. Obviously some additional responsibilities, but it's like any new job you take. It's new responsibilities, new challenges. You face them and you do the best you can \u2013 work with your team and move ahead. So it's fun. We're in good times in the business so that certainly eases the pain, if there is any. It would be tough if we had ugly numbers. That wouldn't be so much fun, I'm sure, but certainly a good time to get promoted at OD anyway. David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: The team is strong and you're doing a good job. Thank you. Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Thank you. I appreciate that. Operator : We'll go next to Ari Rosa with Bank of America. Ariel Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter all across the board. I wanted to ask about the resource additions. Is there a little bit of a concern, or to what extent \u2013 obviously, it looks like the service metrics continue to be topnotch. But is there any concern that you lose some quality as you grow? And in that context, maybe you could discuss the hiring environment and any challenges, whether they be regional or just kind of across the board in terms of wage pressures or difficulty finding skilled applicants? Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Well, I think the challenges are somewhat across the board. Obviously, there are some locations that are a little tougher than others, but we've had growth across the network so we have added folks across the network. Again, I think the pressures that we've seen and the issues that we've seen are in the lost productivity that we've had in the second quarter. We've added a lot of folks; and as David mentioned before, it takes time to get those new employees up to speed. Obviously, what we do it's not just moving a box from one place to the other; it's technical. There's a lot of technical difficulties to overcome. There's a lot of training involved in the technical side of it. We have a tremendous amount of tools that we have to train our folks and get them up to speed to use, to prevent claims, to maximize space, load factor, if you know what I'm saying. But it's not easy to get them there, so it does take time. So I think as we continue to hire them, continue to be some drag; again, maybe a little less going forward than we've had. I don't quite see the needs in the third quarter. I think we made some of the investments, so surely it's a good time to get better from here forward; at least we hope so. But it has been a challenge, but again, nothing we can't handle. Fortunately, as I mentioned before, we have been able to respond to needs and I think that's the good thing. We've got a value proposition that we've committed to our customers to maintain and we can't do it without an adequate supply of people. So, glad we've been able to ramp up and ramp up where and as we've needed, so it's all good. Those are good challenges to have. Ariel Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So going \u2013 I think it was Scott who asked about this, but this idea of hitting 25% type operating margins or 75% OR, is there a way to quantify how much of a drag there was as a result of these \u2013 the time to ramp up and maybe the lag time in some of the P&D employees? How much of a drag did that have on the OR? Because looking at it, obviously you guys posted a phenomenal OR for any quarter \u2013 any LTL company but it sounds like it could have been better. So, maybe I could just get your thoughts on that? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Ari, it's hard to calculate that number and we don't even try to because the cost are what the cost are and that's embedded in what we've done there. Certainly, we've got the opportunity to continue to improve our margins over the long run and I think we've talked about that in terms of just big picture what it takes to improve margins. So, we're going to continue to stay focused there. Some of the challenges that we face those \u2013 as we're growing and we're growing in new locations, the cost per shipment may be different to handle in different places. But we're getting the revenue per shipment growth that we need and that gets into \u2013 if you're taking on new customers or new freight in different locations for existing customers, going through a bid process, trying to understand what the shipment characteristics are to make sure that we're pricing appropriately but then doing the work on the back-end as well to make sure that we did, in fact, get the freight that we thought we would get. So, certainly I think we've been doing a good job there. As you're growing rapidly and adding new service centers that creates a little natural inefficiency as well. You're constantly increasing your shipment count. In some cases, it may be one shipment that creates a new schedule for our line haul operations between cities. So, these are all things that we're dealing with in a high-growth environment but we've certainly handled it pretty well. Ariel Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks for that color, Adam. Maybe if I could throw one more in, that's a little bit out of the left field because it's not often part of the OD story, but maybe I could get your thoughts on doing acquisitions or any kind of M&A? You obviously have the balance sheet for it. And just given how you guys clearly seemed to be much better at managing LTL assets and network spend than your peers, is that something that would ever be attractive or is it just really a focus on organic growth and maybe scaling progressively rather than being able to pick off a undermanaged asset and work on improving it that way? Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Ari, our organic growth has been going so well over the last decade and we see ourselves in just a prime position right now to continue organic growth. That is our priority and it's \u2013 as we've been discussing, it's tough. It's tough to manage the growth where just the organic growth with adding people and adding technology, just staying up with it and keeping the service levels where they are and the claim-free status down \u2013 the claim ratio down as low as it is. We don't need an LTL acquisition to grow our business. We are always getting \u2013 people are always knocking at your door and sending you proposals of this company and that company to look at \u2013 non-asset-based companies and things like that, truckload from time to time. But we don't want to take our eye off the ball managing the business that we're managing now because when we're delivering a return on invested capital up in the high-teens, so \u2013 what is it now? Is it...? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: 20... Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: It's at 20% right now. The best place in the world to invest our money is in ourselves and doing what we know best and what our team knows how to do and make hay while the sun is shining. So, we're not going to say we won't do any acquisitions. It's just not a priority for us right now. Ariel Rosa - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Okay. Thank you for the color. Operator : We'll go next to Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities : Thanks. Good morning. I'll just ask one since it's been a long call. But, Adam, you mentioned earlier in terms of e-commerce that you are starting to see this secular trend show up in the numbers. And I realize it's a small part of the business, but could you give us a sense for what percent of revenues and maybe tonnage that it currently represents? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: We don't break it down necessarily in terms of just e-commerce specific to the overall retail business. It's somewhere around 25%, it's probably ticked up a little bit, maybe a couple of points whereas industrial had been about 60%. There's probably maybe a little tradeoff there just because we've had tremendous growth. A lot of this comes in the form of large retailers that every retailer has got to have an e-commerce strategy. But as supply chains become more sophisticated, as large retailers implement programs that charge back and fine shippers for not getting the freight delivered on-time and without damage, it really creates tremendous opportunity for us and that's the opportunity that we're seeing now. We manage it through our expedited department and have really seen good growth with that piece of maybe the e-commerce puzzle. But, right now, we don't do a lot of residential deliveries of any type. We may have a little small amount of daily shipments that are being delivered within our residential area, but it's other pieces of the transportation mile, I guess, that we're seeing opportunities and some good growth today. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities : Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: (01:05:23) Operator : We'll go next to Willard Milby with Seaport Global. Willard Milby - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. So I just wanted to ask a real quick one. Obviously, you stated that the employee count looks to be a little (01:05:37) going to have a nice seasoned workforce ahead of peak season here. Are you getting any indication that \u2013 from customers that peak season is going to keep creeping forward from, I guess, the usual last two months of the year? Greg C. Gantt - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I think we are expecting a peak yet for sure. I mean, typically our strongest months are yet ahead of us, but we are anticipating that. Willard Milby - Seaport Global Securities LLC : But as far as creeping forward, I mean, maybe a little bit earlier in the year than expected, just kind of given capacity issues in the networks, I guess, across the country? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: We tend to have one of our highest months, from a tons per day standpoint, is in September. And that's been relatively consistent over the years. So I don't know that that we've seen any necessarily wholesale changes in that regard and we certainly would expect to see our trends continue like they have in the past. But as I mentioned earlier, it's somewhat hard for us to tell. We've been capturing so much market share in this environment that we've had now five straight quarters of above-normal sequential growth. Willard Milby - Seaport Global Securities LLC : All right. I guess we've been talking a lot about market share, and I think the size of the market that you've kind of implied with the 10% market share is somewhere in the $40-billion range and that, I think, has grown in recent years. As far as the fastest-growing segment, is that e-commerce related and is that where you've been maybe getting the biggest business wins? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: I think the overall LTL industry is still highly dependent on the industrial market, and I think that's why you saw in late 2015 and 2016 when some of the industrial-related economic numbers were showing weakness, you saw that a little bit in the industry as a whole. So, certainly we believe and we're seeing, to a small degree, some of this retail-related freight that may have been more historically in the truckload area finding its way into LTL but that's just something that we'll continue to keep our eye on. I think that, as I mentioned, about 60% of our revenue is industrial-related, so the industrial market will continue to not only determine a lot of our growth but that of our competitors as well. And we're seeing good growth with those industrial-related customers. Willard Milby - Seaport Global Securities LLC : All right. Thanks for the time, guys. I appreciate it. Operator : We'll go next to Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey. Thanks for the follow-up. Appreciate it. Just really quick, can you share the pricing renewals number for the quarter? Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Scott, we hadn't necessarily been giving that detail on what our contractual renewals have been. Those were embedded in the revenue per hundredweight and that's one element as well as the GRI which we do publish that. It was 4.9%, but we're getting the increases we think we need right now, and some of that is on base rate, some of that is coming through the fuel but it's so hard to reconcile any of those numbers really into what the reported yield that I think it becomes a distraction more than anything. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Fair enough. It's been a long call. Thank you, guys. Adam N. Satterfield - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back to David Congdon. David S. Congdon - Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.: We thank all of you for your participation today. Appreciate your questions and feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thank you very much and have a great day. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to the company's Executive Chairman, Mr. David Congdon. Please go ahead, sir. David Congdon : Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me on the call today are Greg Gantt, our President and CEO; and Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. I am pleased to report the strong financial results for Old Dominion's third quarter. It was another record-breaking quarter for us in terms of revenue and profitability. Financial results for the quarter reflect our ongoing ability to win market share which has been supported by the strategic plan we implemented many years ago. While there are many elements to this plan it is centered on people, our employees and our customers. Our OD family of employees worked tirelessly to build relationships with our customers and those relationships are strengthened by our ability to provide all time and claim-free service at a fair price. This value proposition is clearly differentiated in our industry as is our continuous investment in assets so that we have the ability to grow. The past results have demonstrated an ability to grow throughout the economic cycle and we are confident we can continue delivering long term profitable growth. Economic indicators continue to be positive and coupled with a capacity constrained industry to afford a favorable pricing environment as well as continued strength with our volumes. While we have persistently faced questions from investors throughout this year about when the domestic economy begin to slow it simply hasn't happened yet. 2018 may turn out to be one of the best operating years in our company's history and we're excited about the opportunity for continued growth in 2019. Before I turn things over to Greg, I would like to take a moment to pay our respects to Mr. Scott Britt from Corporate Communications who passed away unexpectedly last week. Scott had worked with us since we went public in 1991 providing guidance on our on Investor Relations and kicking off our earnings calls. He has helped us communicate our story and was a tremendous part of our team. We will miss Scott dearly and offer our deepest sympathy to the Britt and family and his colleagues at Corporate Communications. Here's Greg to provide more details on the third quarter. Greg Gantt : Thanks David, and good morning. Old Dominion produced another solid quarter of profitable growth and our 78.4% operating ratio is a testament to our team's execution of our business strategies. The ability of our team to also maintain best-in-class service standards with 99% on-time and our claims ratio of 0.2%, while growing like we have this year has been remarkable. I firmly believe that our best-in-class service continues to drive our market share growth and I was pleased to see the increase in revenue that exceeded 20% for the third quarter in a row. Assuming normal sequential trends, I expect that our shipment growth will slow in the fourth quarter due to the acceleration in volumes that began in late September of last year. In addition we made strategic operational changes late in the second quarter of this year that negatively impacted some shipments and wait for shipment. Many of these shipments were eliminated from our network were transactional in nature, and generally more appropriate for the truckload industry. And these would have likely moved away from us anyway, when capacity loosens in the truckload sector. We made this call to protect the service standards that are so critical to our customers, while also preserving capacity to meet increased customer demand for LTL shipments. While these changes may have short term implications on volume trends, we continue to believe that we're better positioned than anyone in our industry to win LTL market share over the long term, while following the strategic plan that David referenced earlier. The five year and 10 year compound average growth rates for our revenue has been 11.5% and 9.6% respectively, and revenue growth thus far end of October has exceeded these numbers due to the ongoing strength of our yield. We would expect our yield to trend favorably in the fourth quarter, given the environment and the decrease in weight per shipment that generally results in an increase to revenue per hundredweight. The increases in density in yield during the third quarter contributing to the year-over-year improvement in our operating ratio. In addition, this was the first time since 2011 that our third quarter operating ratio was better than the second quarter of the same year. We believe, we can drive the operating ratio even lower, even in a slower growth environment by continuing to focus on ways to improve operating efficiencies, while carefully managing our discretionary spending. With opportunities to continue to win market share and improve our margins combined with the commitment to invest in the capacity necessary to continue to grow our business, we believe Old Dominion is in a unique position in the LTL industry. Our outlook for the economy and industry dynamics continue to be favorable which gives us confidence in our ability to produce further gains in long term earnings and shareholder value. Thanks for joining us this morning. And now Adam will discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue grew 21.2% to $1.1 billion and our operating ratio improved to 78.4% which is a record for the company and we believe the industry. The combination on these factors allowed us to increase our income before tax by 39.3%. Earnings per diluted share also benefited from a lower effective tax rate and increase 71% to $2.12. Our revenue growth for the third quarter included increases in both LTL volumes and yield both of which were again supported by the strength of the domestic economy and type capacity within the transportation industry. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 12.5% and increased 9.0% when excluding fuel surcharges. LTL tons per day increased 8.1% as compared to the third quarter of 2017 with a 9.7% increase in LTL shipments per day. That was partially offset by the 1.4% decrease in LTL weight per shipment, which is primarily caused by the changes in the mix of our freight and factors just described by Greg. On a sequential basis, third quarter LTL shipments per day increased 1.4% as compared to the second quarter of 2018 which was below the 10-year average sequential increase of 2.7%. As expected LTL tons per day were also below our long-term sequential average. Given the strength in our yields however revenue per day increased 4.0% as compared to the second quarter of this year, which compares favorably to the 10-year average sequential increase of 3.6%. This was the sixth straight quarter that our sequential revenue trend is outperformed the long-term average. We expect that our revenue and tonnage growth rates will moderate in the fourth quarter. Given the material acceleration in revenue and particularly the weight per shipment that began in September of 2017, thus far into October, our LTL tons per day on a year-over-year basis has increased approximately 2%. But our revenue per day has increased approximately 15%. Our third quarter operating ratio improved 280 basis point is network density and quality revenue growth allowed us to improve both our direct operating costs and overhead expenses as a percent of revenue. As stated in our release this morning, we believe the current size of our workforce is appropriate and I do not anticipate any major changes in headcount during the fourth quarter. Going back to the second quarter of last year, we had hired at an accelerated pace to keep up with our growth. Some of our productivity metrics have taken ahead as a result. But we believe we can regain some of those lost ground now that our daily shipment counts are trending more in line with normal seasonality. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $250.7 million and $675.4 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 respectively. Capital expenditures were $177.6 million for the third quarter and $469.9 for the first nine months of the year. We continue to expect total capital expenditures of approximately $555 million for the year, subject to the timing on certain real estate projects. We returned $39.8 million of capital to our shareholders during the third quarter, including $29.2 million of share repurchases. Total amount of shares repurchase and dividends paid for the year-to-date period was $108.6 million. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 was 24.3% as compared to 37.8% in the third quarter of 2017, due primarily to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act as well as certain discrete adjustments made during the quarter. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25.9% for the fourth quarter. One final note before we open the floor for questions. We will no longer count Christmas Eve as a workday in our fourth quarter. This is a new holiday that we will begin providing to our employees this year. While there may be an impact on certain per day metrics and trends, we don't expect there to be a significant impact on our revenue. The fourth quarter of this year will now have 62 work days. Work days for 2019 will be 63 in the first quarter, 64 in the second quarter and third quarters and 62 in the fourth quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we will be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Allison Landry : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to just quickly ask about the length of haul, it's been seen maybe a couple quarters of a sequential increase, which I would think maybe with e-commerce trends and whatnot that, that might be getting shorter. So I just wanted to understand maybe what, what's driving that? Greg Gantt : Allison, it's hard to say, it stayed relatively consistent has moved up a few miles, but I think that our percent of freight that's typically in the - our next day and second day lanes has stayed relatively consistent. It just may be that, maybe we're picking up a little bit more market share in some of our longer haul lanes that that may be skewing it quietly north a little bit. But certainly to your point, I think we continue to see and believe longer term that there will be more opportunity in shorter length of haul lanes these next day and second day lanes that we have very good service in. Our business model was unique though that, through one company we provide regional and regional and national service. And so there are times where our national longer haul lanes may be growing a little more, and we can be growing in those longer and regional lanes as well. But certainly longer term, we would envision just in general in the transportation space, weight per shipments to be declining, which will be good for the LTL industry, and length of haul shortening as well. Allison Landry : Okay. That's really helpful. And so it sounds like, sort of not something to read too much into. And in terms of the way per shipment, I apologize, if I missed this earlier but you know obviously you guys have talked about you know sort of changing your strategy a little bit in the last couple of quarters but do you expect the weight per shipment on a sequential basis in Q4 to be similar to Q3 or does it normally see a sequential uptick? Greg Gantt : Normally it increases a little bit slightly and I don't anticipate really a lot of major changes from here out. You know last year was when we were seeing a significant acceleration. It was September of last year if you recall our weight per shipment had been 1,550 pounds to 1,560 pounds or so in the first eight months of the year and September it went up to 1,620 pounds. And have accelerated there all the way to 1,660 in December. And so you know when we made some of these operational changes that Greg discussed we saw an immediate step down in our weight per shipment. In June we were at 1,622 pounds, in July we were 1,562 pounds. So as we go through the fourth quarter I think that you'll see a bigger decrease in weight for shipment and that's what we were talking about. Our shipment trends continue to be good. We feel like and we've got strong daily shipment volumes coming in but that delta and the weight per shipment that we will get even wider in the fourth quarter could if current weight per shipment trends hold we'll have more of an impact on our tonnage that we report. Allison Landry : Okay, got it. That's super helpful. Thank you so much. Greg Gantt : Thanks, Allison. Operator : We will take our next question from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please go ahead. Christian Wetherbee : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to touch a little bit on tonnage trends and maybe sort of think about What maybe you're seeing from your customers in terms of sort of the pace of activity certainly the comps are getting tougher and that seems to be speaking to you know at least some of the decline. You know a deceleration of growth I should say, but you know are you seeing maybe something a little bit more than that. Is it related to price actions or are you actually seeing some sort of softness in certain end markets that you're seeing customer wise? Greg Gantt : We haven't seen any softness really in you know again part of the decisions that or the reason why we made the decision to eliminate some of these heavier weighted transact or shipments that were more transactional in nature from the network is just the continued strength that that we're seeing and the demand from inbound customer calls to continue to move their LTL shipments. Certainly, we have the ability to move heavy weighted LTL shipments and we still are. There are some shipments in the network that are up to 10,000 pounds and that's fine if we're moving them at the right price. But we felt like the demand, the ongoing demand continued to be strong and we wanted to make sure that we were protecting service and protecting capacity for that strength in those more average weighted LTL shipments if you will that we were seeing. So we haven't seen anything at this point, be at the macroeconomic numbers that we look at or customer feedback that would suggest any kind of slowdown. Christian Wetherbee : Okay, that's helpful. And when you think out a little bit beyond 2018 to 2019, you gave us I think an update for October in terms of the revenue per day obviously it implies a pretty big yield number. How do you think or what do you expect the relationship between tonnage and yield to be as you go out into 2019. Should it be very overweight the yield side you can get sustainable as you guys are doing some of the work on the network to sort of restrict tonnage in certain places and focus on probably what's more profitable for you? Greg Gantt : Well, from a yield standpoint right now certainly the decrease in the wafer shipment has kind of boosted that number. You know we put our general rate increase in effect in June and that was at 4.9%. And you know we don't give any longer contractual renewals, but typically we were targeting contractual renewals somewhere in that same ballpark and sometimes there are higher or lower. But know the optics in, if this current wafer shipment trend holds then certainly it may look like the revenue per hundredweight is it would continue to trend at a very positive level and we'll just see you know on the volume side how the shipments continue to trend. Christian Wetherbee : Okay. And then just last one quick for me just sort of thinking conceptually about the overall comments at the beginning of the conference call. You've given us historically some benchmarks about incremental margins, obviously you've been outperforming. I think those over the course of the last couple of quarters, you know, any new sort of thoughts of what the right numbers should be as we look over time with the work can be at the company? Thank you. Greg Gantt : Yes. I don't know that we're ready to give the long term what we think the operating ratio at least not, not here on the call today but you know I think long term we've said it many times that you know the incremental margin range is sort of in that 20% to 25%. And I guess as if we get closer to a 75% operating ratio we may have to update that. But you know I think we've gone through the math in terms of the relationship with direct costs versus our overhead costs and that's why we can generate incremental margins in the 30% 35% range in certain quarters, I don't know that we're at the point where that's the new long-term range for us, but certainly we've seen it two quarters in a row now with really strong incremental, and I think we've got a good opportunity again in the fourth quarter to have some strong margins. Adam Satterfield : And into next year. Christian Wetherbee : Got it. Thanks very much for the time this morning. I appreciate it. Operator : We will take our next question from Brad Delco with Stephens. Please go ahead. Brad Delco : Hey, good morning, guys. Greg Gantt : Hey, Brad. Adam Satterfield : Good morning. Brad Delco : Adam, you touched on I guess expecting flat employee count in the fourth quarter. It's something that stood out to me on a year-over-year basis, FTEs were up 16.2%. And I think you said previously you expect that the trend in line with shipments that were up 9.7%. So, do you feel like you're overstaffed right now or can you provide some comments on where productivity is versus where you expect it to be? Because it seems like you have some excess capacity maybe in the network. Greg Gantt : Brad, if anything maybe back earlier in the year we were a little behind with our numbers of employees. We got a little bit behind at our peak times, but I think since then we've certainly we've hired an adequate number. We may be slightly overstaffed at this point in time, but it's very, very slight. Certainly with the continued volumes as they are we will make those adjustments as they are needed, but I think we are definitely staffed at this point, and if need be we'll make adjustments as we see fit. Adam Satterfield : Brad, this is Adam. I'll just add to that a little bit. But part of the decision making and making the hires this year is we continue to say we expect a strong year into 2019. So, we wanted to make sure that the workforce is not only appropriate for our current trends, but also what we may see going into next year and we also took a little bit out of purchase transportation that we had last year, that decreased just slightly but still that's the additional line haul runs that we're running that we may have had to outsource a little bit of last year when our volumes are accelerating. Brad Delco : Okay. Got it. That's good color and that makes sense. Greg Gantt : Brad, if anything also some of our folks were probably overworked if you will. Getting those hours adjusted to the more normal type of numbers on a weekly basis really, really makes sense for everybody. So, you can't kill the workforce if you know what I mean. Brad Delco : I got that, makes sense. And then maybe a quick follow-up Adam, this is more nitpicky. But did you give September tonnage and I don't have June tonnage either in my model if you have that one. And then could you tell us what shipments were up in October thus far? Adam Satterfield : On the September results, tons per day on a year-over-year basis were up 4.6%. And then shipment count in September was up 8.8%. Brad Delco : Including shipments for October? Adam Satterfield : Yes. Right now it's - one second, right now the October trend is approximately 6%. Again you can see that that bigger gap if you will, in terms of the weight per shipment and the impact that it's having. Brad Delco : Yes. And I know when I think of ODFL, I think of the model we don't make excuses, we make money. But did Michael - did that Hurricane Michael have any effect on October trends? Noticeable? Adam Satterfield : Hardly. Brad Delco : Okay. Adam Satterfield : There was some impact but, but hardly. And we're not going to make an excuse with it. But definitely there was some impact and we - we take it and we move on. But hardly. Brad Delco : Cool, thanks for the color guys, good results and talk to you guys soon. Adam Satterfield : Okay, thanks, Brad. Operator : We will take our next question from Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Reustle : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question here. Just in terms of the business shift towards that lower weight per shipment. Can you talk about the impact that you'd expect to see through this cycle. I mean do you consider that to stick to your business in any way and just short-term impact and longer term impact as you see that shift? Greg Gantt : I think we've already seen the short-term impact and some of this like we said we felt like was - was more transactional freight that if capacity loosened up, would have moved on terms that weren't ours. And so it may have been business that we were handling and coming to us either directly from customers or through [indiscernible] continue to try to find a capacity for the shippers traffic that they're managing. So you know I think that we were able to control the - the outflow of it, if you will. And so we've already seen and are seeing some impact on our volume trends as a result. But we felt like it was more appropriate to go ahead and make some of these decisions ourselves versus waiting on when capacity might change or might not change in the truckload sector. Matthew Reustle : Understood. And just a follow-up on that, like, how much of that is towards that business is, is market share versus the customers in that space continuing to grow? Greg Gantt : Our market share just in general continues to grow, I think that when you look over any long period of time, we continue to be one of the biggest beneficiaries, if not the largest in terms of when the LTL market is growing and that just gets back to our long-term model. We continue to give very good service at a fair price and we've got the capacity to grow. So those three elements have all got to work together and I think they work better for us than perhaps anyone else in the space. As we've said, we believe in what our business can continue to do and can continue to grow. And so, we're going to continue to reinvest in our service center network to give ourselves the ability to grow and we don't see any signs of slowing down and certainly the long-term opportunity will continue to be there for us. Matthew Reustle : I guess, I ask it in different way, are you seeing any differentiation in terms of growth of that lower rate per segment business, versus growth in the higher wage? Adam Satterfield : No, it's - you know just to be too blown out of proportion. These are not a large percentage share for us, but they're just you know can be very heavy weighted shipments. So it certainly, if you've got one 10,000 pound shipment versus our average that you know between 1500 pounds, 1600 pounds it can have an impact on the overall company weight per shipment, but it's not necessarily meaningful to our ability to grow. Greg Gantt : Matt. This is great. When we were at peak back near the end of the second quarter when we raise the rates what was happening, customers couldn't get their truckloads moved in they were taken 30,000 pounds and 40,000 pounds shipment. Letting them up and ship it them over two, three, four day period. And that's what was in an up on our trucks and you know so instead of our ability to move our LTL we just in some cases, we were restricted and limited because we had these truckloads own. So those were the kind of shipments we cut out. They never were a large percentage of what we were doing. But they were so heavy, they did have an impact on our weight per shipment. So those are the types of shipments that we eliminated when we raise the rates and did what we did. So, like Adam said, never were a real big part of what we were doing. Matthew Reustle : Understood. We're not - but look at the medium weight per shipment rather than the average I guess but very helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : We will take our next question from David Ross with Stifel. Please go ahead. David Ross : Yes, good morning gentlemen. Greg Gantt : Good morning, David. Adam Satterfield : Good morning. David Ross : So question is mainly going to start with pricing, I'm just hoping you can help me understand more than 5% sequential growth in yield. I understand that the way per shipment having a positive impact on yield, but it was only down about 1% like the whole was relatively flat. So, I guess I'm just not understanding, the big jump in yields, maybe there's a freight commodity class adjustment or something that we're missing? Adam Satterfield : Well, for the quarter we did get of - if you're comparing the third quarter to the second quarter of this year, we got our GRI in effect in June, so we had a full quarter impact of it this year versus last year's third quarter to second quarter it was effective in September. So, that certainly helped. But throughout the year, we've been trying to address underperforming accounts, and we've been trying to address yield in multiple ways, in some cases it may be fuel tables, and it could be a multitude of different ways that we try to address underperforming accounts and improving yields. I think that the environment has obviously been very favorable for all of the carriers and so that that's given us the support to be able to probably address maybe some of the underperformers that that needed to have some help if you will because our long-term philosophy is to focus on individual account profitability and that's what our pricing department does every day. Greg Gantt : I'll add to that David, earlier in the year not only were we growing with our existing accounts and gaining more density and so forth. We brought on a lot of new accounts. And oftentimes when you bring on new accounts you bring them on under a pricing program, and certain assumptions, profitability and these new accounts, some of them are not as good as we thought they were from an LOR [ph] standpoint. So we with are with the type of systems we have and the way we can track the cost and profitability, and we began addressing those large accounts. As our volumes continue to grow we felt like we had to you know address those and keep servicing our accounts. So you know that's helped me yield a little bit later. And I was addressing it early year new accounts. David Ross : That makes sense. And then, Adam what percentage of the business roughly is impacted by that GRI? Adam Satterfield : About 25% or so. David Ross : And then last question just I guess for David and Greg, how would you compare the economic environment or really the LTL freight environment versus past cycles you know whether you're talking about 2005-2006 in 2014 you know back into the 1990s does this remind you of any time period more so than others? David Congdon : Overall this year it's probably been one of the strongest freight environments that we've seen\u2026 Greg Gantt : Ever. David Congdon : -- ever. So it really started cranking up in 2017 and going into 2018 it has just been one of the one of the strongest environments. You know right now we've got a solid book of business that is generally priced well and our year-over-year comparisons might start looking smaller in terms of the growth is concerned but we are still blessed with a solid book of customers that appreciate our service levels and our claim-free service. And we've struck a fair price for performing the services that we were asked to perform. And so and the services that we're asked to perform. And so we're just - we're optimistic about next year, the year-over-year because of the tough comparisons the growth may not look as good, but we think our opportunities for continued growth and for improving margins are still there and we're looking forward to a strong 2019. David Ross : Great, thank you. Greg Gantt : With a very strong - very strong top line revenue base to start the year with. Regardless of what the comparisons look like, the base is excellent. Operator : We will take our next question from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, Operator. Hi everybody. One quick one, just with respect to the comment on the release about the headcount growth, the lack of headcount growth going forward. How much more tonnage and shipments I guess given the difference in the decline way per shipment, maybe shipments is a better way to look at it, but how much more shipments can you bring out of the network without adding incremental headcount? Greg Gantt : It's hard to say, I do think we have some capacity right now for sure in our workforce as it stands, but we definitely can stand some growth without adding. So, that's a good thing. I think as our workforce becomes more productive, that's an even better thing for us. That's really where we're putting some focus at this point to try to improve the productivity and one all. So in some cases you can do more with less and I think that's where we're heading. So feel good about\u2026 Amit Mehrotra : Yes. Greg Gantt : -- : Amit Mehrotra : And then Adam you've talked about kind of 20% to 25% incremental margins, obviously you've been running more than that and every quarter we ask you when it's going to go down and you don't really you know - you don't have - seem to have a lot of visibility on that going forward or not willing to share that at least. But I guess with pricing seemingly quite strong, you have a little bit of maybe weight per shipment headwind and tonnage in positive territory. But you know obviously you have some very, very tough comps. I mean, and then just underlying you have a better book of business from a profitability standpoint, it seems like you've been calling some lower profit contracts and so, first as we look at perspectively just given the capacity on the structural cost side, why shouldn't an incremental margin stay at these levels at you know 30%, 35% just given all those moving parts? Adam Satterfield : Just like we've said and we've got visibility into it. But yes, we don't always share. I think when we talk about the 20% to 25% range you know keep in mind in the first quarter that's where we were and I think that that you know we don't manage the business to incremental margins and there are may be periods where we're adding cost into the system. And you know those can be different versus what the top line revenue trend may be. We've still got some capital expenditures on the real estate side that that we need to add to the network and timing. And typically, you know in particular of this year and one of the reasons why the incremental margin strength has been very positive is - you know we've added thus far a six service centers to the network. Typically, there's a lot of inefficiency that comes as you add the service centers and we're doing it for to support our long-term growth. But when you look in prior periods, 2014 is a good example, we had a weaker incremental margin that year and a high growth period versus 2015 was a In a high growth period versus 2015 was a stronger incremental margin as calculated when our revenue growth was slowing. So we're going to continue to make decisions that are right for the long-term and to support our long-term revenue growth can be. And sometimes those may be out of sync in the sense of what the top line is doing. Amit Mehrotra : Yes. One quick one from me if it's okay just nitpicky again, I'm not sure if you provided the sequential change in tonnage and shipments to the course of the quarter I'm just trying to understand kind of the slowdown in September was that more of a reflection of the strength up in prior months in the quarter and really how that compares to the historical on a sequential basis. That's it from me. Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Yes. I'll give the monthly weight per shipment and I'll start with that. So in July and again that was when we had the biggest change that sequential decrease in the weight per shipment, but July versus June was a decrease of 5.4% and the 10-year average is a 2.1% decrease. In August it was a point 0.2% decrease versus a normal or the 10-year average being a 0.4% increase. And then September was a 2.4% increase versus the 10-year average is an increase of 3.2%. So that was on the tonnage side. On the shipments in July it was a decrease of 1.8% versus June, the 10-year average is of 0.8% decrease. Then August was a 0.6% increase versus the 10-year average 0.9%, increase. And September was a 1.8% increase versus 2.6% average increase. Amit Mehrotra : And the first was weak, right, it was tonnage not weight per shipment, right, just to make sure? Greg Gantt : Yes, tonnage. Amit Mehrotra : Okay, great, thanks. Thanks for walking me through that. I appreciate it guys. Operator : We will take our next question from Ariel Rosa with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ariel Rosa : Hey, good morning, gentlemen. So first question, I wanted to ask about the sequential change in the operating ratio. As we look from the third quarter to fourth quarter, it's been about 200 basis points to 300 basis points over the past few years. Is there any reason to think that that we should see variance from that kind of sequential change in the LR this fourth quarter? Greg Gantt : Well, I don't want to give specific guidance there, but you're right. It's normally the 10 year average sequential is a 200 basis point increase in over the last five years the average has been 240 basis points. We'll - this year I think that we've obviously got up a little bit a slowdown in the revenue growth like we've talked about. But we'll continue to monitor the labor-to-revenue trends. I think we've got some opportunity on the productivity side as Greg just mentioned. And so we will be evaluating calls closely as we progress through the fourth quarter here. I think the strength - we had a lot of stars in alignment for the third quarter, and when you go up and down the income statement looking at some of those calls trends and so forth. There were a lot of things that went right for us. And so you just never know what - from one quarter to the next are certain things that aren't necessarily always in our control from an expense standpoint. Ariel Rosa : Sure. That makes sense. So next question, I wanted to ask about the pricing guide, historically you guys have talked about targeting kind of 3% to 4% growth in pricing ex-fuel. Obviously given kind of the timing of the GRIs expected that you know third quarter was pretty strong, but it sounds like it's still trending you know pretty strong into October. I'm wondering to what extent you think that's sustainable or do you think it kind of migrates back to that 3% to 4% range? Greg Gantt : That's long term that's what our revenue per hundredweight has trended in that 3% to 4% range and that's on a next fuel basis, so it's not necessarily what underlying pricing has done. I think that you know we look at it more on a revenue per shipment basis and then compared against our cost per shipment and there needs to be a positive delta there to support the continued reinvestment in real estate, technology and other things that our customers demand of us. So when you look and say going back to 2010, our revenue per shipment is probably up closer to 5% whereas our cost per shipment trends up closer to about 4% which is primarily the wage inflation that we've had and so forth. So, yes the revenue per shipment in the third quarter as you know is trending a little stronger than that. And I think performing better than cost and that does gets back to the strength and the yields and our ability to go out and get the yield increases that we needed this year and it's been supported by the favorable environment like we've talked about. But certainly the optics of those metrics like we mentioned earlier with changes in weight per shipment, there's no linear formula that that can tie through you know changes in weight per shipment necessarily to the revenue per hundred weight, but - but certainly as revenue - our weight per shipment rather decreases that generally has a positive effect on those yield metrics. Ariel Rosa : Sure, that makes sense. And then just last question for me, David mentioned at the start of the call that you know OD has demonstrated this ability to grow through a cycle. You've obviously added a fair amount of capacity in the current up cycle, and I'm just wondering to what extent, we should be concerned maybe to that you know if there is a slowdown that OD could be left with some idle capacity, is that - is that a concern, how do you guys think about managing that risk? Greg Gantt : Right now, we don't have that concern and frankly it gets back to believing and how we can grow the company over the longer run. As you know, we like to own our real estate and we think that's a competitive advantage that we have with the growth that we've had over the last couple of years. The amount of excess capacity that we have in the system is probably not as great as it has been in the past. We're probably closer to the 15% capacity range, if you will from a door pressure standpoint. And so, we're going to continue to - to look at service centers. We've - we've added six thus far, we've probably got one or two more openings that in the fourth quarter. And then looking out into next year, I would expect us to open a fair number of service centers as well. If there's any kind of short-term low, then you know we've got to think about longer-term not just managing to what short-term expectations and depreciation on the service centers doesn't really hit us too bad either. And so, those are - those are things we believe in hit us too bad either. And so those are things we believe in what our long-term capabilities are and we need to continue to invest and certainly our return on invested capital has been very strong and supportive of the - our ability to - want to continue to do invest in ourselves. Ariel Rosa : Makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the time guys. Operator : Our next question is from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Todd Fowler : Great. Thanks and good morning. Adam, on the salaries wages and benefit line this quarter, you're coming in just below 51% of revenue. Was there anything unusual either positive or negative from like a healthcare standpoint or anything we should think about or can you continue to see some leverage on that as the employee productivity ramps and as you slow the headcount growth going forward? Adam Satterfield : Nothing unusual there on the benefit side, we typically give our fringe cost as a percent of salaries and wages and that was 35% this quarter. If you recall in the second quarter, it trended it down, it was just around 33% and I think we commented that we expected it to trend north a little bit in the back half of the year and it did. So, that was something that was kind of expected. But I think that we continue with the strength of the revenue growth, we're getting tremendous leverage on our salaries cost, our clerical cost. We're still seeing benefit on our productive labor cost as a percent of revenue as well and despite the 16% growth in headcount, it may be a little bit of lost productivity. I think that the support of the yield improvement and just the volume of revenue growth that we've had certainly allowed us to leverage most of our calls to everything primarily except for the operating supplies and expenses that were impacted by fuel. Todd Fowler : Okay. And then historically if I go back in the model, maybe a five years or six years ago, that line item on a full year basis had been around 50% of revenue, and it's drifted high over the past couple of years. Structurally, as you think about the business, does that go back to roughly being 50% of revenue, or there things that have changed within the composition of the workforce or benefits that that makes that higher on kind of a run rate basis going forward? Adam Satterfield : Going back when it was back in sort of 2012, 2013 and 2014, when it was below 50%, we were still outsourcing some of our line haul runs, particularly from the Midwest to the Pacific Northwest and to the Northeast, and our purchase transportation was more in the 4.5% of revenue line. So now that we're kind of in a, just call it a 2.5% range. We've taken 200 basis points of PT and move that up into salaries, wages and benefits, as well as there were some of that PT cost that goes into depreciation and operating supplies and expenses as well. So if you do a back of the envelope calculation, outsourcing may look like it is cheaper, but we believe that controlling the assets and controlling the service has been favorable for us, albeit it may be a little bit more expensive. Todd Fowler : Okay. That helps. And just the last one that I had, Greg you'd made the comment that strategically coming into the third quarter, you thought that some of the heavier weighted spot freight was going to back to the truckload market at some point of capacity loosened. I don't know if you have visibility, I mean, can you - are you able to see, obviously you've made some pricing decisions that's impacted your metrics. But are you - can you tell that, has the truckload market loosened or some of that freight would be going back to the market had you not made those pricing decisions. Just trying to get a sense of the tightness or looseness in the truckload market in general and kind of the relationship between the spillover with truckload and LTL? Greg Gantt : Todd, it does appear that it has loosened some of the demand for our services on those shipments is not what it was, not back in peak periods by any means. So it does appear to have loosened some. Todd Fowler : Okay. Thanks for the color this morning guys. Greg Gantt : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning guys. It's Rob on for Scott. Greg Gantt : Rob. Unidentified Analyst : One more thing, when we're looking out to the fourth quarter obviously third quarter incremental margins were very strong. It feels like there could be even additional upside given that we've got slowing headcount growth relative - and a bigger spread or a similar spread between yield improvement versus kind of shipment growth. How should we be thinking about kind of incremental margins in near-term in light of that deceleration in headcount growth and then potentially uptick in productivity? Greg Gantt : You know Rob, I don't know that you know we're obviously not going to come in and give any specifics, but you know I think I generally or earlier I was trying to generally say that, that certainly you know we can continue to have some strong incremental margins and certainly that is potential in the fourth quarter as well because you know we wouldn't expect anything materially to change from a yield standpoint I think they will continue to see the strength there and revenue growth is continuing materially to the change from a yield standpoint you know I think that we'll continue to see the strength there and you know our revenue growth is continuing as we said in October, it's at 15% and you know a lot - I know it sort of caught up in what the tonnage growth is versus just what the absolute level of revenue growth is. But you know at 15% revenue growth you know we're trending and kind of above what our long-term average, we've been able to grow the top line at about 12% to 13%, when you look over various periods of time, whether it's going back to 2010 or even going all the way back to 1997, when we started putting this plan in place and that's been supported or it's been comprised rather of kind of 7% to 8% growth on the shipments and the balance in the yield kind of 4% to 5% there to make up that difference and you know so I think that we've got revenue growth that - that's continuing at a strong double-digit pace and probably more of that made up in yield right now, you know even though we've still got strong shipment growth just slightly below maybe what some of those long-term averages are. So, it certainly sets up those to have what we believe could be a strong fourth quarter and you know a really strong finish to the year. Unidentified Analyst : That makes sense and that actually segues nicely into my next question. Adam, in the last couple of calls, you've been talking quite a bit in terms of the fuel component of pricing. With regard to your fuel surcharges, are you now where you want to be kind of across your customer base as we leave third quarter 2018 or there are just still more opportunities to - to kind of make some adjustments there? Adam Satterfield : I think you know fuel is has remained has increased, but it's remained relatively consistent this year, which is a good thing. I mean, it's increased a little bit sequentially as probably started the year at about $3 a gallon on average and in the third quarter is about $3.25. We had some customers that we've addressed the overall yield and the point I was making earlier there's multiple elements of the yield improvement that may have had a lower contractual fuel table, and so we've made some adjustments in certain places versus trading off fuel versus a base rate increase. I think it all kind of goes into the ball of wax that has been or yield improvement over the year. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And from an all-in basis, do you feel like that's where it should be or is there more opportunities net-net to kind of strengthen and drive at some levels is what we've been seeing recently? Adam Satterfield : I think that where we are now, I don't know that there's many contracts left to that need to be addressed, and just depending on where fuel prices stay, if we stay in a fairly consistent band from where we are and maybe where we've even been if the recall I think it was 2016 when the price has declined and we waited to go back to our customers and address those when it was at on a lower part of the scale. But certainly we tried to look then at all elements of the scale and whether it's fuel prices being on the lower end or even north of where they are now to make sure that that we're paid appropriately for the cost because when fuel cost goes up, it's not just the cost of diesel fuel that we face. There's a lot of indirect impact in our total cost structure. We get through in many petroleum based products that we use. And so we see cost inflation and other elements just outside of the roll cost of diesel fuel. Unidentified Analyst : Makes sense. I appreciate the time guys. Operator : We will take our next question from Matt Brooklier with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Matt Brooklier : Hey thanks. Good morning. I'll try to be quick here. Adam, do you have a service center count for at the end of third quarter? Adam Satterfield : Yes. We're in 234. Matt Brooklier : This year has been a growth year-over-year in terms of investments, as we're looking out to 2019 you have a sense for directionally where total CapEx could end up? Adam Satterfield : We haven't finalized that at this point. We're starting now to - this is typically the time of the year where we start doing our planning out for 2019. But to my point earlier, I think that we would anticipate having another healthy year of real estate CapEx for sure. Matt Brooklier : Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate the time. Operator : Our next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Thanks, guys. Just a couple of follow-ups here, just on the OR front, I was a little surprised you shared the commentary earlier on the call that even if we get a slowdown next year, you expect to the OR to kind of remain if not in the 70s or kind of at current levels-ish. Given that typically in slowdowns, we see customers become more price focused versus service. What gives you that confidence that that you can kind of retain OR's current level, is it on the cost side, is it on the service side, where do you think that sustainability lies? Greg Gantt : Ravi, I think it's - we do have some opportunities on the cost side to make some improvements for sure. We've been in a dead run this year for most of the year, so I think you can equate a lot of what we do and if you think about where we've been, you could see that there are some opportunities there, so we surely hope so. But you know the economics that we work and the economy and whatnot certainly drive our pricing and drive a lot of what we do. So we're just going to have to wait and see. But we do think we have some opportunities within our network to make some improvements and if the economy holds then, we certainly think we can improve, even at a slower growth rate. Ravi Shanker : Okay, understood. And just to clarify something you said earlier, did you say that you have about 15% spare capacity or no, I believe the number historically is about 25%? Greg Gantt : Yes, that's about where we are right now, and there's no exact science to calculate and it's sort of between 15% to 20%, but you know probably on the lower end of that range. And you're right, we've historically we kind of try to target about a 25% excess capacity within the service center network. Ravi Shanker : Okay, got it. And just lastly, there's been this prevailing narrative about LTLs in general is going to benefiting from e-commerce. Can you give us an update on that? I know what growth are you seeing on the e-commerce side, what percentage of your tonnage comes from e-commerce. And then probably more importantly, you know are you seeing any kind of mix shift in your tonnage base, which I think has historically been more industrial focused towards consumer? Greg Gantt : Ravi, it's hard to say you know what's necessarily coming from e-commerce. I think, we need to talk more generically in terms of retail and every retailer needs to have some type of e-commerce presence. But we do believe that that we'll continue to see trends of smaller shipment sizes for retailers and that should push freight into the LTL environment. Certainly it's not something that's happening overnight, but it's happening. In addition, many retailers have got these on time in full programs which not only is good for LTL, but it's good for high service LTL carriers, and we've been able to grow our market share there. As a result in this most recent quarter, our retail oriented customers are growing between 25% and 30% and that's probably a little bit faster than our industrial oriented customers if you will that are growing sort of in the 18% to 20% range. And historically we had been about 60% industrial and about 25% retail and in industrials staying about the same, but retail is probably picking up a couple of points if you will, and it's moving a little bit higher. But I think industrial related freight certainly continues to drive not only our business but typically highly correlated with LTL business in general. Ravi Shanker : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ben Hartford with Baird. Please go ahead. Ben Hartford : Hey, good morning, guys. Adam any change on kind of the 30 service center count plus or minus longer term that you've been talking about? Adam Satterfield : I think it's - we've probably lately been seeing more in the 40ish type range and say more in the 40-ish type range and you know that's one of those things that will probably consistently change. The reality is you know we think we know what we want our service inter base to be as we continue to grow the company but sometimes we find out that it may be having more service centers particularly in the metro area makes more sense from an efficiency standpoint. But you know I think we're in a pretty good shape now as you know we've got we're in the process of developing our plan for next year and I'd like to see a little bit more investment there. I'd be nice if we could find existing service centers but it seems like we've got to find more at this point land and then building out which takes a little bit longer and it's why over the last few years our service center count growth has slowed a little bit. But we're in good shape, I think we've got a good plan and we'll be reinforcing that long-term real estate plan here shortly as we start going through our annual strategic planning sessions in the fourth quarter. Ben Hartford : Your cash balance particularly at quarter end has risen in recent quarters. As you think about the balance sheet as you pay in the context of OR having doubled this cycle if line of sight to continue to improve and presumably do you think about the cash management and leverage ratios a little bit more differently? In other words you've got a more sustainable underlying free cash flow base with the margin profile higher and as you start to have a line of sight to some of the way in the real estate needs, do you look at cash management a little bit more progressively and is there opportunity at minimum to take some of the cash levels down that you've seen rise over the past opportunity minimum to take some of the cash levels down that you've seen rise over the past year or so? Adam Satterfield : Our cash balance really rose when we took a year-off of buying shares on that repurchase program. And it's - we've had probably a little increase this year, but we'd like to target being able to spend our operating cash flow into capital expenditures, and then returning capital to shareholders. And so with our share price at lower levels, now typically the way our repurchase program works where we're buying more shares and so maybe we'll use a little bit extra cash in that regard. But we'll continue to look at and go down the capital allocation priority scale and the first is certainly reinvesting in our sales and many of these service centers that we're looking at particularly in areas like California and so forth are going to be more expensive than for the land component than we've faced in the past. So that will certainly be one use and when we go down the spectrum and in end with returning capital to shareholders, and we'll continue to evaluate ways that maybe we can increase that as well. Ben Hartford : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : And there are no additional phone questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to David Congdon for any additional or closing remarks. David Congdon : Thank you all for your participation and questions today. Feel free to call us if you have anything further. Thank you very much, and have a great day.",

At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's Executive Chairman, Mr. David Congdon. Please go ahead, sir. David Congdon : Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. With me on the call today are Greg Gantt, our President and CEO; and Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. I am pleased to report the strong financial results for Old Dominion's fourth quarter. For the third quarter in a row, we exceeded $1 billion in revenue and also produced an operating ratio below 80%. This performance capped off an extraordinary year for Old Dominion, setting new company records for annual revenue and profitability. Financial results for the quarter and the year reflect the consistent execution of our growth strategy. We believe our ongoing ability to win market share is based on a value proposition of providing superior service at a fair price to shippers, while also continuously investing in our service center capacity to support our long-term growth. We also continue to invest in our OD family of employees, and we are proud that our team provided customers with 99% on-time deliveries and our cargo claim ratio of only 0.3% of revenue for the fourth quarter. While there has been some recent disruption to the domestic economy associated with political issues, our outlook continues to be positive for 2019 based on feedback from our customers and other macroeconomic indexes. Pricing environment remains favorable and a strong domestic economy should support our ability to increase volumes and network density. Even though 2018 marked one of the best operating years in our company's history, we look forward to the opportunities for yet another year of continued growth in revenue and profitability in 2019. And now here is Greg to provide some more details on the fourth quarter. Greg Gantt : Thanks, David, and good morning. The OD team delivered once again in the fourth quarter producing an increase in revenue of 15.2% and an increase in pretax income of 51.1%. The financial results for the quarter and the year demonstrate our team's successful execution of our strategic plan that has been in place now for many years. The plan is centered on our OD family and the relationships our employees build with our customers. To maintain and strengthen these customer relationships, generally requires the power of a promise, a promise to provide superior service standards, while also providing customers with the capacity, technology and flexibility to help them grow and be successful. The freight industry has always been about relationships and each member of the OD family understands this concept, as we serve our customer's needs. Being able to keep the promises made to our customers require significant and ongoing investments in our employees' capacity and technology. Our yield management philosophy is designed to help support these investments, while also offsetting our inflationary cost increases and understanding of cost is particularly important as we add new customers and expand our service center network. Our revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 6.9% in 2018 and this was the key component of the overall improvement in our operating ratio during the year. Having now produced an operating ratio below 80% for three straight quarters and a sub-80 OR for the year, we believe we can continue to drive the operating ratio even lower. We have long maintained that a focus on density and yield, both of which require the support of a favorable macro environment of the key ingredients for long-term improvement in our operating ratio. Driving additional volumes through the existing service center network improves network density and the resulting operating leverage allows us to improve our existing service center's efficiency, which positively impacts the company's overall operating ratio. Given our confidence in winning additional market share, we intend to expand our service center operations beyond the existing network of 235 service centers. Our fleet, we were able to add seven service centers during 2018, and we plan to open another 10-or-so service centers in 2019 depending on the timing of construction projects. We believe these additional service centers as well as the expansion of some existing facilities will increase the overall average capacity within our network to ensure that it is not a limiting factor to volume growth for the next few years. We will focus on all of the previously-mentioned initiatives in 2019, and we will also have an opportunity to regain some lost ground relating to the productivity in our operations. With opportunities to further improve revenue and our cost in 2019, we believe Old Dominion is in a unique position to continue delivering industry-leading profitable growth. Our outlook for customer demand trends in the economy continue to be favorable, which gives us confidence in our ability to produce further gains in long-term earnings and shareholder value. Thanks for joining us this morning. And now, Adam will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue increased 15.2% to $1 billion for the fourth quarter, and our quarterly operating ratio improved to 78.7%. As a result of these factors, our net income before tax increased 51.1% to $217.4 million. Our earnings per diluted share, however, decreased 18.4% to $1.95, due primarily to the $104.9 million net tax benefit included in the fourth quarter of 2017. I was pleased with our fourth quarter revenue growth, which once again included increases in both LTL volumes and yield. Slight slowdown in the pace of our revenue growth as compared to the growth that exceeded 20% for the first three quarters of 2018 was primarily due to the significant acceleration of revenue that began in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our LTL tons per day increased 2.9% as compared to the fourth quarter 2017 with a 6.5% increase in LTL shipments per day that was partially offset by the 3.3% decrease in LTL weight per shipment. As we detailed in our third quarter call, we expected this decrease in weight per shipment and also expect a similar trend through the first half of 2019. On a sequential basis, the trend for both LTL tons per day and LTL shipments per day was in line with normal seasonality. As compared to the third quarter of 2018, LTL tons per day decreased 2.3% and LTL shipments per day decreased 4.1%. Our fourth quarter operating ratio improved 520 basis points to 78.7% and included improvement in both our direct operating costs and overhead expenses as a percent of revenue. 390 basis points of this change was due to the improvement in our salaries, wages and benefit costs as a percent of revenue. While we hired significantly through the first three quarters of the year, as reflected in the 14.2% increase in average headcount, our full-time headcount at the end of December was slightly lower than that of at the end of September 2018. Our team will continue to manage workforce capacity with anticipated shipment trends as we always do, and we currently believe that our workforce is appropriately sized. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $224.7 million and $900.1 million for the fourth quarter and 2018, respectively. Capital expenditures were $118.4 million for the fourth quarter and $588.3 million for the year. Based on anticipated growth and the execution of our equipment replacement cycle, our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $490 million for 2019. This total includes $220 million to expand the capacity of our service center network. We returned $97.2 million of capital to our shareholders during the fourth quarter, including $86.7 million in share repurchases. The total amount of shares repurchased and dividends paid for the year was $205.8 million. As noted in this morning's release, we are pleased to announce that our quarterly dividend will increase 30.8% to $0.17 per share in the first quarter 2019. This allows us to maintain a similar dividend payout ratio as the prior year. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 26.6% and was 25.7% for the year. We currently anticipate our annual effective tax rate to be 26.0% for 2019. One update on our revenue growth for the first quarter of 2019, January's revenue was impacted by severe winter weather over the last two weeks of the month as well as the negative impact on the broad economy related to the government shutdown. While there is no way to truly quantify the impact of these factors, our revenue on a per day basis increased approximately 8% for the month. While it's still very early in February and political risk continues, revenue growth for the first few days of this month is averaged approximately 10%. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Chris Wetherbee from Citi. Christian Wetherbee : I wanted to maybe pick up on some of the comments that you made about the improvements you've been able to make in the operating ratio and maybe get a sense of sort of how you're thinking about the potential going forward? I know you don't like to give guidance around this and so happy to kind of talk about this in more general terms, either on sort of shorter term next couple of quarters or may be bigger picture taking a step back and think where you can go over the next couple of years, but clearly there's been significant progress in pricing, but also efficiency on the operating side seems to be driving. Can you give us a sense of maybe what you think the business is now capable as you look forward? Adam Satterfield : Sure, Chris. As we mentioned, we don't want to give specific guidance at this point in terms of how low we think the operating ratio can go. There were definitely some factors in the fourth quarter that helped us from an OR standpoint, especially when you look on a sequential basis versus the normal third quarter to fourth quarter trend. But I think it's important to point out that for the year, the operating ratio improved 310 basis points. And really when you go back in time and look, it's pretty incredible what we're able to achieve this year, and it really compares the type of improvement we had coming out of recession. And I think, it does get at the heart of what we always talk about, from a big picture standpoint, continuing to focus on density through the network and improving yield and those two factors combined together helped in this regard. And I think our costs pretty much came in line with what we expected this year, but from a revenue standpoint, we certainly had more volumes, I think, than we anticipated going into the year as well as the yield performance was really strong as well. Going forward, obviously, we'd like to see the same type of mix continue from a top line standpoint, but the yield performance that we had this year is probably not going to continue long term and it's certainly not in line with what our long-term trends have been either. We generally have more of a balance and weighted, including from a shipment standpoint than the yield. But I think that we've certainly got continued opportunities to grow market share and that will continue to drive the business through the existing network. We'll continue to add capacity, and we'll continue to look at putting as many dollars on the bottom line as we can from the revenue growth that we're achieving. Christian Wetherbee : Okay. So there's no real sort of view that this should be a stopping point though for you from an OR perspective as we look at the 2019? Adam Satterfield : Not at all. And I think that's why we've tried to, in Greg's comments, repeat that when we look out over the system and see that the operating ratio improvement that we're seeing at the individual service center level, the ongoing improvement that we can believe is we're adding capacity to these centers. That trend can continue and it's generating phenomenal incremental margins for us. David Congdon : I'll add, this is David, that just the quality of the business that we have and the way it's generally priced though and our mixture of variable and fixed cost in our overall financial structure just lends itself to the operating ratio being able to improve. It's additional density and a rational pricing environment, which we believe we have, with a little help from the economy, which we believe we'll have. That density across the network should yield some improvement in margins going forward, and we just feel stronger about that. Christian Wetherbee : Okay. That's very helpful. Greg Gantt : This is Greg. To keep in perspective, that 310 basis point improvement in 2018 was versus a record year in 2017. It was the best year we'd ever had at that time. Christian Wetherbee : Yes, certainly, very impressive. In terms of -- just a follow-up on sort of the trends that we're seeing now, can you give us tonnage numbers for what you saw in January? I'm sorry, if I missed them. And then obviously it sounds like February, at least a couple of first days, have improved. Can you just give us a sense of where volumes are trending Jan-Feb, that would be great. Adam Satterfield : Yes. Chris, I intentionally left out the volume number and the reason for that was I felt like last year as we moved through the year, there was so much focus on the calls in terms of where we were from a short-term perspective and, honestly, had a few investors suggest that, that we shouldn't give the data any longer. We'll continue to put that detail in the Qs and K, but we felt like let's just talk about things from a broad perspective in terms of revenue and we're seeing revenue now at the double-digit pace, like I mentioned, at about 10%, that's early in this month and each day continues to be impacted by weather. The January was the same and really it was more of -- every year, we deal with winter in January, it's not a onetime event, but the difference that, I think, impacted us and other carriers this year was the magnitude of the storms that moved through really the last week of the month where your freight volumes are typically building. But we're starting off the year in a good spot and we feel optimistic and, like we mentioned in our prepared comments, a lot of that optimism is based on macroeconomic trends that we see as well as the customer demand trends that we continue to get reports from our sales team on. So we feel like we're in a good spot starting the year out with strength. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Allison Landry from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Allison Landry : I wanted to ask about the headcounts. You mentioned the workforce is appropriately sized. So is the Q4 average headcount a good run rate to use for 2019? Or do you expect a little bit of variability there in the quarters? And then could you comment on your driver turnover sites in Q4 versus Q3? Adam Satterfield : I think where we are today with the headcount, think about going all the way back to '17, we got behind our growth a little bit. Last year, we were playing catch-up, and I think that's why we saw the headcount growth exceeding that of our shipment volumes. Over the long term, those two generally are fairly close together. I think where we are, we're continuing to evaluate and we do this on a daily basis at each of our service centers, what the labor force looks like that's managing the freight. And I think, we're in good shape overall. We'll probably have some service centers that are making additions and some that are staying flat. I think the point is, normally by this point and like in the fourth quarter, for example, we're typically increasing the workforce. It generally averages about a 2.5% increase from the third into the fourth quarter as we're getting everybody on board and ready for the next year's growth. And then that increase is likely as we go through the first quarter. I think what we realized was by the fall of last year, and we communicated this on the last call, we felt like we were in good shape then. So we've kept everybody in place. Because we're still anticipating growth, I think that we can hold the headcount fairly steady in the early part of the year, but anticipating growth. We will have that higher, and we'll see some net additions later in the year, I just think, by the time that we get to the middle point of the year. Hopefully when you look at a longer-term basis, our headcount growth is more in line with what the shipment growth looks like. And some of that will depend on, are we gained on productivity as well? From a turnover standpoint... Allison Landry : Okay. With respect to the... Adam Satterfield : Go ahead. Allison Landry : No, no, go ahead. Adam Satterfield : First I'm going to say, the answer to your turnover question. By the end of the year, we were -- the turnover rate was 8% on average for the company and then about a little less than 1/3 of our drivers actually come through our in-house driver training program and -- for those graduates that was between 5.5% and 6%. Allison Landry : Okay. Excellent. And then on the service center side, I know you mentioned the expectations are open about 10 this year, I think you opened six in 2018. How do we think about the headwinds from the startup costs related to the service centers? Would you expect there to be meaningful headwind going from 6 to 10 or through the productivity benefits and ability to handle more tonnage? Does that off -- [indiscernible] to 6, will that offset any costs that come from the additional 10? Adam Satterfield : Allison, I think, our ability to better service our customers and gain market share surely should help meet some of the additional expense. There are some startup expenses that we can absorb, but in the whole scheme of things, I don't think it's going to be significant. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche. Amit Mehrotra : Adam, I guess, everyone is concerned rightfully or wrongfully about when the downturn in volume and yields will come for the general LTL sector. So I think it would be helpful maybe if you could help us think about how Old Dominion is positioned in that kind of opposite environment to what you're seeing now in terms of the 10% revenue growth in January. Certainly you showed stellar performance in '16 in the last industrial recession, but where specifically you had the opportunities on the cost side to limit decremental margins that come with negative revenue growth? Do you guys think you can still be in kind of the low 80s OR environment of medium and more severe downturns? Adam Satterfield : I guess, you have to just look back at how we've reacted in the past and what our plan has been in prior slowdowns, and '16 obviously was an industrial slowdown and we had flatness overall with the revenue and then you go all the way back to the recession area environment and that's '07 to '09 period. But we stick to the same strategic plan that we've always stuck to. We stay focused on our yield management practices, trying to continue to serve our customers well and keep service metrics high, so we can really give our customers a value proposition that may be more important in a slowdown and a slower time than when things are busy. If we can take the total cost of transportation down by providing 99% on-time service and 0.2% to 0.3% claims ratio, that can ultimately save cost. The trade invoice might look a little bit higher, but overall cost of service might be cheaper for customers. So that's the big thing and then we'd also look at any potential opportunities from a long-term standpoint for any service centers that might become available as competitors and others might be looking to sale facilities and generate cash flow. So we look at any opportunities that may present themselves in that regard, but I think that the way we manage cost, the way we manage our labor cost on a day-to-day basis, we've obviously got opportunity from a productivity standpoint. We lost some productivity across our operations last year, despite the fact that we're very efficient. We lost a little and I think we can regain that. So there's multiple things that we can go through and look at and ultimately we'll be trying to protect the bottom line, and I think when you look back in prior downturns, that's what we've got a history of doing. Amit Mehrotra : Right. Okay, that's helpful. And just one as a follow-up, trying to understand conceptually how incremental margins evolve as shipping growth continues to equip tonnage growth. I would expect costs to more closely follow shipment growth, clearly that hasn't been the case in 2018. So if you can just help us think about that and maybe your expectations for how operating expenses or OpEx should trend as a -- relative to shipment growth in 2019 or OpEx relative to shipment in 2019? Adam Satterfield : Sure. Yes, I think when we started the year, I gave the -- last year at this time the forecasted, I felt like, cost on a per shipment basis, excluding what yield would do, would be up about 4.5% and essentially that's how we ended up on [indiscernible]. When you grow in shipments, you're bringing on new business and each new business levels might have different pickup cost, delivery cost or different element of line-haul costs that ultimately we're trying to manage all of those things and came in line essentially with where we thought we'd be. Might expect a similar type of increase as we go into 2019. I'm expecting somewhere around that same kind of 4.5%, excluding the fuel on a per shipment basis, but ultimately we'll be trying to manage every dollars as best we can. The biggest component of that inflation is the 3.5% wage increase that we provided to employees in September. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brad Delco from Stephens. Albert Delco : It seem like you talked a lot about volumes driving additional density and the question I want to ask is, what does density really mean? And where I'm going is, I assume your load average is already pretty high in this environment. And so what benefits does additional density give you? Is it loading more directs? Is it cut out dock handling? Just kind of explain that if you don't mind. Greg Gantt : I think there are several different aspects of density. The one that, I think, first comes to mind is certainly, it'll help us on the pickup and delivery side. We should have shorter distances to get to our customers. It certainly improves the service that our customers see, the response times that they see. So that'll help us. Load factor surely can help if we grow our business. We've got an opportunity to improve our load factor and hopefully you can make more directs. Now there is a downside to open additional facilities also that comes with making directs, if you think about it, because you're spreading out tonnage. Until you grow back into it, you're spreading out the tonnage over more locations. So we'll deal with that as we go, but we typically -- you'll see a dip and then we'll get it back over the course of time. But we've seen nothing but success with opening additional facilities. So I don't expect anything different. I think the biggest thing is getting closer to our customers and the response that we can give them versus our competitors and what not, but that's the real advantage. Albert Delco : So there is still room though on terms of your load factor to improve that? Greg Gantt : Absolutely. We'll never get to Utopia from a load factor standpoint. That will never happen. Albert Delco : And then a quick one for... Adam Satterfield : I missed that, Brad, excuse me. Sorry guys, I think the headset was dying on me. Are you still there? Albert Delco : Yes. Greg Gantt : Yes. Albert Delco : And then a quick follow-up for, Adam, if you don't mind. The reduction in the fringe benefits, was that related to the phantom stock? And can you quantify what that was for -- on a year-over-year basis in dollars? Adam Satterfield : Sure. That was a part of it, Brad. We have and we put this in our 10-Ks that there's about 356,000 invested shares stock and we remeasure the phantom stock, we remeasure that every quarter, as you know, based on the 50-day movement average or a stock and so with the drop in our stock price during the third to the fourth quarter, that was about a little over $8 million favorable impact in the quarter. So that was part of it. We also have an annual remeasurement of our workers' compensation liabilities. We get through an actuarial process in the fourth quarter for that and for other claims as well and that was a favorable entry as well. So we put that number in the release and certainly that was a big part of it. If you recall, I think, at the beginning of the year, we felt like the fringe rate would be 34% to 34.5%, that's our fringes as a percent of salaries and wages. Going into next year, I'd expect the same kind of average for the year. I think that you'll see probably some choppiness in the first quarter that might be a little bit higher, especially if our stock price recovers somewhat from where it was low closing out the year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason Seidl from Cowen and Company. Jason Seidl : I want to talk a little bit about looking forward in terms of how OD is going to stay at the top of the market? One of the things, I think, over time that you've clearly been at the forefront has been technology. Can you tell us a little bit about any new initiatives that you had planned or that are sort of going through the system right now that'll keep you guys up on top? Adam Satterfield : Jason, I think that technology has been key for our operating efficiency over many years, and we're always looking at implementing new technologies and improvements. Our foundation for success, a key piece of that is continuous improvement and that applies to all areas of our operations. So I think we'll continue to look at tweaking our operational technologies, to improve dock efficiencies, our P&D efficiencies and we're looking at ways really to improve a lot of our processes here in the corporate office. And so if we can continue to drive process level improvement, it may save us costs, but ultimately what we're trying to do is improve customer service and that may be anything related to just getting better information from a billing process out to our customers and improved shipment visibility as well. So we're going to continue to invest. I think we spend generally about $20 million to $25 million every year in technology and a lot of that was all designed to try to improve our operating efficiencies. Jason Seidl : Okay. I guess, the next question was brought up before. People talk about a slowdown. Have any of your customers indicated to you that there was a pull forward for some of their business due to the tariffs that are set to take place on March 1? Adam Satterfield : We hadn't heard that at all. We started getting that question last year quite a bit and pulled our sales team and we got no such response. It's more Dear and the Headlights kind of look. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ariel Rosa from Merrill Lynch. Ariel Rosa : So first, I want to touch on the seasonality. Typically, I think, over the last couple of years, you guys have seen about a 200 basis point deterioration from third quarter to fourth quarter in terms of the operating ratio. Just wanted to get your thoughts on, has something changed in terms of shipping patterns or customer behavior that may be changes that dynamic going forward? Or was there something unique this year that or for 2018 that caused it to be so much smaller than the historical trend? Adam Satterfield : A big part of it, we were essentially flat, just up 30 basis points, but that discussion we just had on that fringe benefit rate, that was probably about 0.5%, maybe slightly more when you look at where our fringe rate was in the third quarter going into the fourth. So that gets us close to that sort of 200 basis point mark, but the last few years has actually been higher. We've been about 240 basis points or so the last 3, 4 -- over the last five years. So we're certainly pleased. And I think that just like we've seen all year, we just continue to have quality revenue growth coming in throughout the year and strong yield performance and so that's just allowed us to continue to improve cost across the board really. Ariel Rosa : Got it. That makes sense. And then historically, I guess, if we go back a couple of years, you guys have talked about a long-term goal of achieving double-digit market share. You've obviously got into that point. Looking forward, I'm wondering is there a limit to the growth potential in terms of -- obviously, the way you guys price your product, it is done at -- looking for a premium in terms of the quality of the service that you provide. Do you think there's a limit in terms of how customer willingness to pay that? Or how big market share could get? Do you bump up against a constraint in that regard at some point? Adam Satterfield : So we certainly don't see or feel any limits and part of that is we don't want our prices, it all kind of comes back full circle. You go back to the technology discussion we were just having and driving efficiency in our operations, we can continue to drive efficiency and keep our costs lower. The price to market is not always is big of a gap between us and our competitors as what might have seen when you compare our operating ratio. So we're doing everything we can to keep our cost and check, but certainly we feel like we're investing heavily and servicing our capacity to be able to continue to grow and that's a key part of it. If we don't keep adding the capacity, that could become a limiting factor to our growth. But when we look out the number one carrier in terms of size in the industry, is about close to 20% in the market. So I think that, that creates a bogey that you can say certainly we can sort of keep set our sights out further ahead from where we are today. Ariel Rosa : Great, that's really helpful. And just a quick follow-up on that point. In terms of the service center footprint, hypothetically if you were to get to that 20% market share target, could this current service center network handle that capacity? Or where would you have to get to in terms of investments or expansion to meet that target? Greg Gantt : We couldn't handle what we have today, not by any strat. So we would have to continue to increase capacity. That took us a lot of years to get to where we are today. So I'm sure it's going to take a while to get to double our market share, but we would absolutely have to continue to add capacity. I think we're doing that today. We're adding it at a pace that doesn't cripple us. From an operating standpoint, we're adding it at a pace that we can handle that makes sense and continue to meet our customer needs. David Congdon : We've got to be methodical and do it selectively. It will take more service centers and larger service centers, and we keep a good gauge on the door pressure at every service center and look at it continuously and try to look at it over a long range so that we can get ahead of need and rather acquire land and build and so forth before we run out of capacity. That's been our practice and will continue to be our practice going forward. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt Brooklier from Buckingham Research. Matthew Brooklier : So a pricing question. If you could maybe provide a little bit of color in terms of your expectations for contract, rate increases? I think in a relatively healthy economy, you look for something in a 3% to 4% range, but was just curious to get your thoughts on what increases could look like this year? Adam Satterfield : Generally, we try to -- our long-term practice has been to go out and seek increases that cover our cost inflation. So I just mentioned that we think that cost inflation may be in the 4.5% range. So that will be the starting point typically too, that will sort of get all tied into whatever the general rate increase might be for the year and so that'll be sort of the basis point, if you will, and starting some of those conversations. But some of it just depends on what the environment's like we made this past year, the revenue per hundredweight. The yield improvement was stronger. A lot of that was in addition to core increases and consistent increases, which the consistency is very important to our customers, but we brought on a lot of new accounts and took on new business with accounts and in some cases, it had higher cost to handle. And so that was part of that overall increase in the yield this year, that 6.9% increase was more than just core price increases, if you will. Matthew Brooklier : Okay, that's helpful. And then some of your competitors have already announced the GRI. Just curious to hear if GRI could be in the cards for you guys? Greg Gantt : It will be, but we have not made any decisions on it as to when -- as to what or when. Matthew Brooklier : Okay. And then just last question. If I look at your targeted CapEx for this year of $490 million, it's down about $100 million, it's a pretty big swing. Wanted to hear your thoughts on, if that $490 million number could look a little bit different depending upon the environment, let's just say, you grow at a faster-than-expected rate. What could that number look like? And then I'm assuming it's not going to be above $100 million. But the message here is you probably have incremental free cash flow, right, in '19 to potentially deploy, I think the dividend increase ate up about $10 million of that, but what are your thoughts on deploying cash in '19? Adam Satterfield : So the CapEx question, we typically are spending 10% to 15% of our revenue into our CapEx every year, and it's a little bit lower than last year and it's primarily in terms of the tractor and trailer piece of the truckload. That fluctuates every year replacement -- the replacement need fluctuates every year and then, obviously, we've got a growth component that kind of gets all baked into that number as well. And I think from where we've been on our replacement cycle the last couple of years, probably don't have as many replacement units in the tractor pull, if you will, this year. The average age of our equipments improved. It's about 3.5 years now. So we've had nice improvement in the age of the fleet over the last couple of years. And I think we're in a good shape there. So -- but we have flexibility to your point and we've done this in years past. The volumes come in stronger than what we anticipate. We typically, with the relationships we have with our OEMs, we can go back to them and increase orders, and we don't have a major history of the incentive for some reason if they weren't as strong. We certainly can cancel some orders as well. David Congdon : And we can flex with our trade equipment, taking some of the replacement trucks and holding onto them longer, should we see a surge in business in the fall, for example, greater than what we anticipate. Matthew Brooklier : Okay. And then just following up on the potential for incremental free cash flow generation this year, again you announced the dividend increase, but maybe talk about what's left in the share repurchase authorization. And just your general thoughts on kind of preferences there. Adam Satterfield : Well, as you know, the repurchases have been the priority for us in terms of returning capital. We stepped up our repurchases in the fourth quarter compared to what we had been spending in the early part of the year and a lot of that was just based on our share price being depressed, we felt like. So certainly we've got that opportunity to step those up even further. The share price continues to stay low and we're always buying on a daily basis with our 10b5 program that works and buys a consistent amount. We were pleased with approximately 31% increase in the dividend. And typically the way we've looked at that is what are the earnings from the prior year have been and what the payout for the next year might be and that increase just kind of keeps that overall dividend level pretty much in check from a percentage standpoint as where we've been in the past. Operator : We'll take our next question from Todd Fowler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Fowler : I think maybe David made a comment earlier about the quality of the freight in the network at this point. And I guess, I'm just curious, do you still have opportunity to trade up freights? And if you saw any freight that was kind of nontraditional maybe truckload freight coming into the network last year when the market was relatively tight? Has a lot of that gone back? And I'm just curious on kind of your pricing opportunities and the ability to continue trade up freight going into 2019. Greg Gantt : Todd, I don't know trading up is the term that we use a lot. We'll certainly try to improve pricing. If it's poor, we'll certainly try to improve it. Don't know that we try to trade up a lot, but we have a challenging account, on account it's challenging that if the costs are high, then we'll certainly try to take increases on that business more aggressively than on account that otherwise operates efficient and all those things. But anyway, I think there's always some opportunity there. I mean, with the amount of shipments we handle on a daily basis, you're always going to run across something. So I think there's always some opportunity. I do think we probably harvest some of that low-hanging fruit, if you will. There is not nearly as much as it was at one time. But there should be something in there possibly to improve this year, but I think it's not going to be a big boom for us in any way. Todd Fowler : Okay. Great. I'll take credit for the term trading, but I appreciate your perspective on it. And then just for my follow-up, Adam, can you speak a little bit to the insurance and claims line item here this quarter? It looks like it was favorable on an absolute basis and then also as a percent of revenue, was there anything unusual in there? Or are you getting some benefit from some of the investments that you've made in the fleet? And how would you expect that to trend going forward? Adam Satterfield : Yes, the fourth quarter every year also includes an annual actuarial adjustment and process that we go through, which can be favorable or unfavorable. And if you look during the year, we averaged about 1.2%. We had a favorable adjustment in there that drove it down to the 0.9%. And then when you look in last year's fourth quarter, it was an unfavorable adjustment. So that was up to 1.4% in the quarter. So I think that'll go back. The two components that are in there are auto liability, exposure, including the premiums and then our cargo claims ratio. So the claims ratio is in that between 0.2%, 0.3% type of range and the auto has been in that kind of 0.9% to 1% range as I knock on wood here. So we'd expect, based on all the investments we've made in safety tools and so forth and claims prevention tools to keep that number trending, I would think in somewhere in that same type of range as we work our way through the first three quarters of the year. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Ross from Stifel. David Ross : I've two quick questions. One, can you talk about any regional strength, any parts of the network feeling tighter or looser than others, anywhere you see business particularly good? And then the second question is just on the $95 million of IT spend for '19. Is that focused on any specific areas? Adam Satterfield : Yes, well, let me address that one first. That $95 million is IT and other assets basically, and the other assets component in that forecast is about $50 million. That's our forklifts, switchers, all sorts of other things that go in there. It's generally somewhere about $35 million. Other things that we put scales and dimensions and so forth into the service center, so with the plan for 10 service centers this year, that piece of that net total is a bit higher. And then the IT is higher this year and that number includes costs that we're planning to replace, our logging devices so that hardware in each of our 9,000-plus units will replace this -- will be replaced this year. And so that's why that IT piece is a little bit higher than our normal $20 million, $25 million. David Ross : And the first part of the question on just regional strength or weakness through the network? Adam Satterfield : It's been pretty balanced, Dave. It generally has been for us, fortunately, and that's what we'd like to see to be able to keep the line-haul network somewhat in check. But I would say, this year, we continue to have really strong growth through the Midwestern region of the U.S., I think that, that kind of fits with just industrial activity in general and the fact that we've added a lot of capacity in that region over the last couple of years. We've also had quite a bit of growth out on the West Coast as well. We're seeing pretty strong growth there. And so I think the CapEx plan this year will be hitting -- continuing to hit really all regions, but Midwest, Gulf Coast where we've seen a nice growth and out in the West and South East as well. So it's just sort of across the board with the door additions that we're planning to make this year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Willard Milby from Seaport Global. Willard Milby : I was hoping you tackle the -- I guess, the headcount efficiency question from a different angle. If I look back 2016, I think year-over-year ending headcount was about flat or maybe slightly down with flatter, flattish volumes in 2018, headcount up 10%, volumes up 10%-ish. What has changed from a workforce efficiency point of view? And kind of what's that excess capacity or efficiency that's already in this workforce that you have right now that you feel comfortable maintaining levels for 2019 when we assume if the economy helps out some more volume growth for 2019? Adam Satterfield : Yes, I think going all the way back to 2016, that I think you referenced, '16, as I mentioned earlier, was a flat year from a revenue standpoint. And look, it's not easy across the network today of 235 service centers to get the workforce exactly right. And so when we went through a flat year of 2016, we leave the hiring decisions up to our service center managers, likely a little hesitant and careful with making additional hires as we started progressing through '17. And '17, the volumes and revenue really stepped up as we progressed through the year, and we were a little bit stronger than what we were initially anticipating. So we're playing catch-up for quite a bit of the year. And that's why we've lost some productivity, but we also had to increase our use of purchase transportation as we progress through '17, and it did slow down. I mean, that was when that material acceleration happened as we finished out September '17 and as we got up to about 19.5% revenue growth in the fourth quarter and that continued at plus 20% as we progressed through '18. So we were hiring same kind of reverse of '16 as volumes were continuing to come through a set of very rapid pace. People are adding capacity for an employee account standpoint to make sure that we could keep up with what was coming at us and what we anticipated coming at us this year. And so we may have got a little bit heavy as we progress through the year and that was why we made the decision in the fall that on an overall basis that we felt like things were in good shape, and we could keep it fairly steady. But that's the say that we've got some normal attrition that may be happening in some locations and then you got other locations that are still growing at significant rates and they are hiring people as they should be. Willard Milby : Okay. So as you look at it from an efficiency point of view and I don't know if you'll get it maybe from a capacity point of view. You've kind of kept dock towards your terminal capacity above [indiscernible] maybe 15% to 20%. What would you say that is when you look at your workforce? I mean, how much more volumes do you think you can put through before maybe that has to get addressed again? Greg Gantt : We probably are on the higher side of the capacity right now, which is opening those excess service centers starting out the first of the year, which is typically our slower months. But we've got, like I mentioned earlier, 10 service centers planned to open this year. So as we open those, that capacity will continue to grow unless we get unexpected surges in volume. So we'll have to see how that works out, but right now the capacity is good. I think it's on the higher side of what we've talked about being in the 15% or 20%, but it's a moving target. You got less in some, more on others. And so we just have to keep addressing the locations where we're tied, which is what we're doing with those facilities that we've got plan for this year, and we were focused in the areas where we're struggling and that's where we're adding. Operator : We'll take our next question from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Scott Group : So, Adam, that 8% and 10% for Jan and Feb, do you think you can give us that ex fuel? I imagine a good amount of the deceleration in the revenue growth is just fuel. So if you have those two numbers, it'd be helpful. And then just on the fuel, like, do you think it had much of an impact in 4Q? And do we need to think about it as a potential maybe small headwind in 1Q since it's lower year-over-year? Adam Satterfield : At this point, it's pretty comparable, the average rate to where fuel prices were last year. So I would say, it's -- from a revenue per hundredweight standpoint, it's -- those two numbers with and without fuel had pretty much come back in alignment. So I think what we might see, depending on your forecast for fuel, if prices stay where they are right now, it was last year more so in the second quarter that we started seeing the average price of diesel increasing. Maybe on par in the first part -- or in first quarter rather and then -- and we'll see how the price changes and then the comparison with the prior year, but it's more in the second quarter where we started seeing that sequential increase in prices. Scott Group : Okay. And then just on the competitive dynamic, just kind of maybe two questions. The YRC obviously had some labor uncertainty. Are you hearing anything from customers that suggest that there is a share opportunity there? And then just how do you think about truckload versus LTL pricing historically correlated? Do you think they're correlated anymore? Adam Satterfield : I think we talked a lot about that in 2016, and I believe then as I do now that the way the LTL industry has changed and the consolidated nature with about 80% of the revenue being in the top 10 carriers, that you won't necessarily see those same type of patterns with LTL pricing following truckload. And I think that when you look at the health of the industry, there's a lot of other carriers that need to continue to push for increases. And part of the reason why there's been a lack of capacity additions and I still feel like the industry as a whole is capacity constrained is margins probably haven't been there to support any kind of material increases in capacity. So it certainly created an opportunity for us. And when you look at how the market's changed over the last 5, 10 years or so, I think over the last 10 years, we captured a little over 1/3 of what the market has grown and we've seen that in our market share numbers. So we're going to continue to focus on making those additions in capacity and continuing to take advantage of the market share opportunities that we have, and we think we've got a selling advantage when you go up and down the board against each of our competitors. And so we believe our service value is better. That's come through as we've won this Mastio Quality Award for the past nine years and we're proud of that and it takes service, given the service at a fair price and then you've got to have that final piece of capacity and that's what we tried to stay so far ahead of our growth curve to be able to grow with our customers. Scott Group : Did you -- I missed it if you said anything sort of about like the labor uncertainty, if that may be accelerate some of that share? Adam Satterfield : Yes. We haven't seen anything at this point any material way that, that I'm aware of. Certainly, shippers always have conversations with us around any kind of contract period as they go through it to discuss any kind of contingency planning and so forth. And so we'd handle that just like we have in the past. No need to chase freight in any way. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ben Hartford from Baird. Benjamin Hartford : Adam, just coming back to that CapEx question, a couple of quarters ago, you talked about 12% to 15% CapEx as a percent of revenue, that's been the historical range. Obviously, the guidance is a little bit below that. It's at the bottom end of the recent relevant range. From the context of all the discussion today about capacity and staying ahead of future anticipated growth, has that historical range of 12% to 15% CapEx as a percent of revenue has that -- is that no longer a guide post? Should we be thinking about the lower end of that going forward given the 2019 guide? Or should we revert back to some sort of medium between that range? Adam Satterfield : I don't know that anything has changed necessarily with that range. I mean, certainly we've got another healthy year with respect to real estate and some of what we'd spend in that regard is dependent upon what's available and how many projects our internal team can complete, but a lot of the real estate in the area that we're continuing to expand into metro type of areas, the cost of land continues to accelerate and some of the costs of these facilities are measured in the tens of millions of dollars. So we still want to continue to own the real estate that we have in the network and that's our number one priority. But I think that the biggest change, as I mentioned earlier, and why it might be a little bit lower as a percent of revenue this year is just we've got a little bit less need on the equipment side, but that kind of goes in cycles. We've got generally about $150 million on average from a replacement standpoint on the equipment and, I would say, we're replacing less than that this year based on the patterns of the prior two. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Lee Klaskow from Bloomberg Intelligence. Lee Klaskow : I just had a quick question about when you guys are opening up new service centers, how you resource those? Are you reshuffling assets? Are you going out and buying new trucks and trailers to source those? And also how do you approach the headcount? Are you moving employees around? And roughly about how many employees do you need to have to have one of those new facilities fully staffed? Greg Gantt : We certainly reshuffle employees typically at the service centers that we've been opening. Of late, our spinoffs in the cities that we already service, we just find a piece of property in a different part of town and do a spinoff. So we relocate employees or they relocated. In lot of the cases, they just got in closer to where they live, and you know what we're saying. But we move not only closer to our customers, but closer to our employees. So we shuffle equipment, we shuffle employees. What typically has happened, we've been able to grow faster in those new locations and the old ones tend to fill back up. So like I mentioned before, we're able to get closer to our customers, give better service and we experience better growth in those situations than we do in our old standalone existing facilities. So it's more a reshuffle of assets and depends -- the question about how many, it just depends on the size of the market. It could be anywhere from 15, 20 drivers to 50. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to David Congdon for any additional or closing remarks. David Congdon : We want to thank all of you today for your participation and your questions. Feel free to call us if you have any further questions. Thanks, and have a great day. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

As a final note, before we begin, we welcome your questions today, but ask, in fairness to all, that you limit yourself to just a couple of questions at a time before returning to the queue. We thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir. Greg Gantt : Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2019 conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. OD team delivered another quarter of strong operating and financial performance, producing a 7.1% increase in revenue and a 21.9% increase in net income. Following seven straight quarters of double-digit increases in revenue, our rate of growth from the first quarter was slightly lower than our expectation at the beginning of the year. Our team responded by improving our yields and managing our cost. And as a result, our operating ratio improved 190 basis points to 82.0%. First quarter financial results demonstrate our team\u2019s successful execution of our strategic plan that as you all know, has been in place for many years. This plan is centered on our OD family and the relationships we have built with our customers. These relationships are built on trust and our proven ability to provide superior service as evidenced by our 99% on-time service performance and 0.2% cargo claims ratio in the first quarter. We will continue to focus on providing superior service, which provides the foundation for our ability to continue to win market share and improve yields. We have often discussed the fact that the ongoing improvement in our operating ratio requires improvements in both our density and yield, with a positive macroeconomic and pricing environment supporting these initiatives. While our volumes have been slightly low \u2013 lower than anticipated so far this year, we remain cautiously optimistic on the domestic economy based on favorable economic indicators as well as general feedback from many of our customers. We are also encouraged by the general stability of the overall pricing environment, although we have recently seen some evidence of competitors losing their discipline. Our LTL revenue per hundred increased 9.6% as compared to the first quarter of 2018, although a portion of this increase was due to changes in the mix of our freight. LTL revenue per shipment increased 5.2% to offset the increase in our cost per shipment during the first quarter. Our yield management philosophy is designed to offset inflationary cost increases, while also supporting our ongoing investments in our employees, capacity and technology. These investments help us improve our operating efficiency, while also providing the capacity and technology to support our customers\u2019 needs. Our ongoing investment in service center capacity is also critical to achieving our long-term growth initiatives. We continue to invest in service center assets regardless of the economic environment. As doing so, provides us with the network capacity to immediately respond to favorable changes in demand, similar to what we experienced in 2017 and 2018. We recently reduced our planned expenditures for tractors about $10 million, however, to better match our fleet with current shipment trends. We have also continued our regular process of matching labor cost with current volume trends. We stated on our earnings call from the third quarter of 2018 that the size of our workforce was appropriate for anticipated business levels and we continue to believe that is the case. While the average number of full-time employees increased as compared to the first quarter of 2018, the number of full-time employees at March 31, 2019, was 2% \u2013 2.2% lower than our headcount at September 30, 2018. We do not anticipate any major changes in our headcount during the second quarter and expect to see a convergence of the year-over-year change in headcount and shipments per day as we progress through the year. I command the entire OD team for their performance during the first quarter of 2019 that drove our overall results. Our level of superior service continued and productivity improved in spite of the operational challenges that are typical for the first quarter. We are off to a solid start of the year and continue to have opportunities for continued growth in revenue and profitability. With an unmatched value proposition of providing superior customer service at a fair price, we remain confident in our ability to win market share over the long-term and increase shareholder value. Thanks for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion\u2019s revenue increased 7.1% to $990.8 million for the first quarter. The revenue growth on a per day basis was 8.8%, as the first quarter of 2019 had one less workday than the first quarter of last year. Combination of the increase in revenue and 190 basis point improvement in our operating ratio allows us to increase our earnings per diluted share by 23.3% to $1.64. The revenue growth for the quarter was driven by the 9.6% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight as our LTL tons per day decreased 1.4% as compared to the first quarter of 2018. While shipments per day increased 2.7% during the quarter, our LTL weight per shipment decreased 4%. As we have discussed over the past couple of quarters, we expect a decrease in weight per shipment for the first half of this year. On a sequential basis, the trend for both LTL tons per day and LTL shipments per day were both below normal seasonality. As compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, LTL tons per day decreased 4.6% as compared to the 10-year average decrease of 0.7% and our LTL shipments per day decreased 3.4% as compared to the 10-year average increase of 0.3%. April, our volumes are also trending below normal seasonality or their yield trend is holding steady. As a result, our growth in revenue per day is trending lower than our first quarter growth rate. April 2019 does include the impact of the Easter holiday, which was included in March of 2018. Similar to the process that we described on our previous earnings call, we will provide the actual revenue related details for April when we file our Form 10-Q. Our first quarter operating ratio improved 190 basis points to 82.0%, and included improvement in both our direct operating costs and overhead expenses as a percent of revenue. Salaries, wages and benefits as a percent of revenue improved 150 basis points and included a 60 basis point improvement related to our productive labor. We were pleased to see improvements in the productivity of our dock and our pickup delivery operations during the quarter. Our line-haul laden load factor average unfortunately decline, but that is fairly typical in an environment where weight per shipment is declining. Our aggregate overhead costs improved as a percent of revenue as well, despite the 60 basis point increase in our depreciation costs due to the significant investments in capacity and technology. We expect depreciation cost as a percent of revenue to continue to be higher on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of this year. Old Dominion\u2019s cash flow from operations totaled $206.2 million for the first quarter of 2019 and capital expenditures were $70.7 million. Based on our plan to continue to increase service center capacity as well as our regular equipment replacement cycle, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $480 million for 2019. We\u2019ve returned $44.4 million of capital to our shareholders, during the first quarter, including $30.6 million of share repurchases and $13.8 million in cash dividends. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 26.1% as compared to 25.9% in the first quarter of last year. We currently anticipate our annual effective tax rate to be 26.1% for the second quarter of 2019. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we\u2019ll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Todd Fowler : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Greg, in your prepared comments, you commented that you\u2019ve seen some incremental pricing competition recently. Can you just provide a little bit more color around what you\u2019re seeing, maybe how widespread it is and kind of your thoughts on the impact of that through the second quarter? Greg Gantt : We\u2019re just starting to see it with some of our larger accounts. We\u2019re not losing business accounts, but we\u2019re maybe losing certain lanes, because we were outpriced. So, we\u2019re just seeing some aggression that we have not seen in prior years. It\u2019s not widespread at this point, but we are seeing some. So I think time will better tell that story, but we have seen a little more aggression than we\u2019ve been used over the last couple of years. Todd Fowler : Okay. And is that concentrated with a handful of specific players or is it more kind of broad-based than that? Greg Gantt : Broad-based. Broad-based, Todd. We\u2019ve seen it \u2013 there is \u2013 this is not just a specific carrier by any stretch, it\u2019s broad-based. Todd Fowler : Okay. Adam Satterfield : Some of what we\u2019ve seen too is just a little change in shipper behavior in the sense of maybe trading out some of the freight that we may have been allocated from their book of business in the past to, perhaps, another carrier that just has a lower published rate. So it\u2019s not all \u2013 that it\u2019s someone coming in and dropping cost as part of a bid process. We have seen some of that and that\u2019s what we\u2019re referring to, but in some cases, I think, shippers that had experienced cost increases related to transportation last year are coming out and looking at multiple ways to try to save some costs, but we still believe our value proposition allows them to do so by giving best-in-class service and the other things that we provide. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be focused on. And you asked about the impact on the second quarter, and right now we\u2019re still continuing to see our yield train hold steady. We were pleased to see the increase is maintained as we progress through the first quarter and that\u2019s continuing into April. And it was last year, about this time, that some of our mix started changing as we progress through the second quarter and then definitely the weight per shipment changed significantly as we got to the back half of the year. So just running now what our revenue per hundredweight would be in kind of the normal sequential increases that that we see as we go through contractual renewals, we expect that from just a reported revenue per hundredweight standpoint a slight decrease in the second quarter and then that will converge more in the second half of the year with what true increases we\u2019re really seeing with accounts. And it won\u2019t have that same impact from the mix of freight that we\u2019ve seen with the big decreases and weight per shipment. Todd Fowler : Okay. Sorry, I\u2019m just trying to understand the comment, the decrease that you\u2019re expecting in the second quarter is the absolute reported yield sequentially versus the first quarter, is that what that comment is? Greg Gantt : Right. And I don\u2019t mean for a decrease, I\u2019m just saying where we saw about a 9.5% increase in the first quarter that may compress just slightly, but right now frankly it\u2019s holding steady as we go through April, and certainly we\u2019re not changing our pricing philosophy in anyway and would expect to continue to get the cost base increases that we always target with our accounts. Todd Fowler : Understood. And just a follow-up then or as my second question. In this environment, understanding that density and yield are what really helps the incremental margins with the lower tonnage growth, what are your thoughts on incrementals? Can they be kind of in your normalized range going forward? It sounds like you\u2019re getting some productivity improvements, both at the labor and the dock, and you also made some comments about overhead. So how do you think about incremental margins in an environment where tonnage is a little bit slower? Thanks. Greg Gantt : I think that, as we\u2019ve seen in the past, certainly the incrementals the past few quarters have been really strong. This first quarter is similar to the environment where we\u2019ve got revenue slowing a little bit, but we\u2019ve been targeting taking cost out of the business and that\u2019s why we often say we don\u2019t manage to the incremental margin, we\u2019re managing the business for the long-term. So with that though we\u2019ve got to make changes to the plan when it comes to the short run and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019ve been doing with respect to cost in the first quarter and we\u2019ll continue to target cost where it makes sense as we progress through the year. But to have an incremental margin, you got to have solid revenue growth and especially when you\u2019re looking at something like our depreciation costs that have been up and \u2013 between $9 million to $10 million range, to have that type of quarter-over-quarter increase, certainly to get a 25% plus incremental margin you\u2019ve got to have sufficient revenue growth. So we\u2019ve never said that the 35% or over 40% margin was the right long-term goal, and we continue to talk about 25%. And so, perhaps, this \u2013 the revenue growth slows a little bit, then that number kind of convergence back into \u2013 to what our longer term goal has been. Todd Fowler : Okay, that makes sense. I\u2019ll pass it along. Thanks for the time. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from David Ross with Stifel. Please go ahead. David Ross : Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Greg Gantt : Hey, Dave. Adam Satterfield : Hey, Dave. David Ross : So in looking to continue to expanding the service center capacity, are you running into any real estate issues yet, whether it\u2019s in terms of cost or availability? Greg Gantt : David, we had our hands full last year with challenges all over the country really, but we\u2019ve been somewhat successful in finding either property or properties or land where we needed it. So we\u2019re in good shape right now and we\u2019re continuing on with our plan as we developed it over the last couple of years of, hopefully, opening somewhere between 6 and 10 centers this year, and continuing to buy the land that we see that we need for future growth. Really we\u2019re pretty good right now. I feel good about where we are and what we\u2019ve got and what we\u2019re working on. I think we\u2019re in a good spot. We just got to continue on. We think we\u2019re ready. David Ross : Yes. And do you have the sites generally identified or what, I guess, the plan if they\u2019re not available in the locations you want them? Greg Gantt : They\u2019re identified and in most all cases bought. Yes, we have identified where we have the needs and in most of all cases we have land. We are working on permitting and all the due diligence and all that goes with that at this time. So, we\u2019re executing that plan. David Ross : That\u2019s good. And then, Adam, quickly on the customer, I don\u2019t want to call rate pressure necessarily but when you\u2019re talking about some lanes going away, not accounts going away but certain lanes, how much of that is 3PL driven? I know you guys have a decent amount with 3PLs and thinking maybe, in this quarter, some people are pressing the pricing button a little bit and maybe that\u2019s the channel where they\u2019re going or is 3PLs not an outsized contributor to any of the market share switching? Adam Satterfield : We\u2019re actually seeing good growth with our 3PL related accounts or we did in the first quarter and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve said that when we talk about customer demand trends and some of the positive feedback we\u2019ve had, a lot of that is originating with the conversations with 3PL. So I think some of the lanes where we\u2019re seeing going away, maybe on some of our larger national accounts and, I mean, again, I think it\u2019s getting back to where some accounts are just looking at their overall cost of transportation and maybe you\u2019ve got some internal pressures to try to save some costs. And in many cases, we get feedback and this has played out many times over the years, where we may lose a little business on price and we just don\u2019t feel like it makes sense to always try to give on price when we\u2019re given the level of service that we give. But sometimes we lose a little business on price and it comes back to us on service down the road, that certainly played out many times before. And it could be that it comes back on service and it could be that it comes back on capacity and we continue to believe the industry\u2019s capacity constraint, both from a \u2013 primarily from a real estate standpoint, but also when it comes to equipment and so oftentimes we\u2019ll see and get feedback where we may lose a little bit of business, but when a end of a quarter or end of a month peak comes about and somewhat doesn\u2019t have the trailing equipment capacity, customers call us right back and we\u2019ve certainly got it and can help our customers. David Ross : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our next question from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good morning. So if I\u2019m trying to think about the comments in terms of the below seasonally normal revenue per day trends in April and the commentary on some incremental competition as far as pricing goes, I mean, is there any way to sort of read into these trends from a macro standpoint? I mean, do you think things are feeling a little bit weaker, or how do you think that there is some other maybe transitory factors that are playing a role here? Adam Satterfield : I don\u2019t think it\u2019s weakness or we don\u2019t believe that right now and a lot of that gets back to just some of the macroeconomic numbers that we review and, in particular, given the amount of business that\u2019s industrial related for us, I assume trends have continued to be positive. And a lot of the conversation with customers are continue to be positive in the sense of what they think their businesses will do this year. So I think some of it is just \u2013 some pricing pressures that are coming about, some large players looking to try to, maybe, generate some cost savings within their cost structure and often times that may come at an increased cost, that may just go to a different cost center, and so that\u2019s why, based on past history and given where our service levels are, we\u2019d expect to get some business back in due time. But, yes, we haven\u2019t really necessarily seen any major capacity changes in the industry, so we don\u2019t feel like anyone has done anything different that would go out targeting freight. But I think when given some of the weakness that\u2019s been in the first quarter, you may just have some other carriers that are out trying to get some freight back into their networks and that\u2019s just causing a little bit of weakness. Allison Landry : Okay. So it sounds like some of what\u2019s going on with the lane shifts at these bigger customers, is that what you think is primarily driving the below seasonally normal revenue per day trends, like more so than some macro issues, for example? Greg Gantt : I think you also, Allison, you got to take into account the capacity in the truckload industry that\u2019s out there now. So that\u2019s got to be having some impact and it\u2019s kind of hard to put your finger on exactly where that is in our network, but we know there is capacity there now and this time last year it wasn\u2019t quite the case. So just a little bit of a headwind we got to deal with too. That capacity time is back up. Allison Landry : Okay. And then in terms of the length of haul, it looks like it\u2019s ticked up slightly year-over-year for the last two to three quarters. Anything that is unusual there that\u2019s sort of driving the modest increase or is there some kind of \u2013 is indicative of any type of underlying trends? Thank you. Adam Satterfield : I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything major that\u2019s going on there. It\u2019s up a few miles and that could just be we\u2019re winning a little bit more share in some of those longer-haul lanes and the beauty of our network is we\u2019ve got a very high-quality regional, inter-regional and national service product. And so, we still believe that longer-term we\u2019ll see the length of haul shorten and freight moving more within our regional network, if you will. But because of our high-quality service offering, it\u2019s probably just that we may have picked up a little bit of incremental share in some of those longer-haul lanes. Allison Landry : Okay. Excellent. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Chris Wetherbee : Hey. Thanks, and good morning, guys. I just wanted to touch a little bit on tonnage trends and obviously as we\u2019re moving into the first quarter, it sounds like we\u2019re not necessarily either seeing a rebound here, wanted to get a sense from a seasonal perspective if you\u2019d expect to see something more meaningful this far along in April or maybe you start to see better seasonality as you move into May. Just kind of curious to get a sense of sort of how you would expect that typical seasonality to play out and if you could see that tonnage reflect a bit more positively as you move through the second quarter? Greg Gantt : That\u2019s the normal trend and certainly we\u2019d hoped to see that play out. It\u2019s just this first quarter was a little bit unusual with the different effects and, yes, we started out in January with pretty nice revenue growth and then we had a few snowstorms there at the end of the month that kind of moved through in some other weather impact that we felt like kind of depress that and we also had early part of the first quarter the governmental shutdown. So there was a lot of noise that was hard for us to sort through as we progress those first couple of months. And when we got into March, we felt like we would see break, kind of get back to normal and see some of the build up like you\u2019d normally see progressing through the end of the quarter and we finished the quarter with good results. The month of March itself was just a little bit below what our normal seasonal pattern is, but we started out in such a deep hole in January. January, on a sequential basis, was down 1%, there is normally a 3.4% increase. So we are back above seasonality in February and then just slightly below, but just have started out April again with \u2013not seen the strength in terms of the way revenue deals from the beginning of the month to the end, it\u2019s been pretty consistent. But certainly we\u2019d hope to see some things start picking up on what the normal spring season would be. But we\u2019ve got a plan for it and we\u2019re planning. Obviously, in the first quarter, revenue growth was a lot slower than what we saw last year. We\u2019re coming off a year with 20% growth and we started talking last year about focusing on cost and I think that we got ahead of the curve in the sense of looking at labor very intently, kind of, late fall and that has continued. So certainly we\u2019ll continue to look at cost and we\u2019ve produced good results in the past in a slower revenue environment and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to look to, but certainly it\u2019d be a little more helpful if we could get a little bit more revenue growth and it\u2019s just now coming now. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Now, that\u2019s great color. In addition to the OpEx side, thinking about the CapEx piece, certainly there is an interesting opportunity over the long run to build that capacity to continue to sustain the growth. When you think about some of the shorter-term dynamics, what would you sort of need to see to, maybe, take your foot off the gas from a CapEx or expansion plan standpoint? Just trying to get a sense of, would you need to see sort of significantly worst tonnage for you guys to dial back the capital and sort of decide to, maybe, take a little bit of slower approach to the expansion? Just want to get a sense of how you sensitize that? Adam Satterfield : Well, we pull it apart in the sense of looking at what\u2019s the short-term capacity needs and that\u2019s primarily on the equipment front. And so, we continue to monitor trends as we progress through the first quarter and made the decision to cut about $10 million out of the tractor budget and that\u2019s just keeping the fleet somewhat in balance with what current trends are. So that\u2019s number one. We can also with \u2013 and this is what our normal process would be on the equipment that we would have replaced this year if volumes are stronger than what we anticipated for. You hold onto some of that replacement equipment longer. And if need be, if they\u2019re softer, we can get rid of it a little sooner than maybe what we would have otherwise done. And so, we try to go through that process to manage the depreciation impact, if you will, from the equipment piece. Otherwise, on the technology side, we\u2019re continuing to make those investments and investing in tools and things that we think can help us whether is driving automation or process improvement, but ultimately it\u2019s driving efficiency and that will help us on the call. So you\u2019ve got to spend to save, that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019ll do. And then the biggest piece of the budget every year though is what we spend on the real estate and that gets to what our long-term belief is in terms of how we can continue to grow the company. And these are investments that take the projects, that take longer time to complete, and they don\u2019t really impact the income statement in a material way since we like to own these assets, but we\u2019ll continue to make those investments there because we may not need it now but we certainly may need it again. And I think when you go back and we had these conversations in 2016, the environment was slowing, but we continue to invest in the capacity and had we not built up that door capacity then we wouldn\u2019t have been able to grow like we did in 2017 and 2018. So it\u2019s important to get those assets in place now and we certainly can defer some of the openings and that may be what we do in some cases and that will prevent some of the overhead costs that go along with the service center openings. So that\u2019ll be one way that we can differ a little bit of cost coming on to the books. But the capacity is a long-term play. We certainly believe that we can continue to win market share with our service product and we want to have the capacity in place when business level surge again. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, that\u2019s great color. Just to clarify that the tractor, the $10 million for the tractor, is that the difference from the $490 million to the $480 million, is that what that delta is? Adam Satterfield : I\u2019m sorry, can you repeat that? Chris Wetherbee : The tractor reduction of $10 million the expense \u2013 the spending on tractors, is that the difference from $490 million, which I think you gave us last quarter to $480 million on the capital expenditures? Adam Satterfield : It is. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just wanted to clarify that. Thank you very much. Adam Satterfield : Sure. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ariel Rosa with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ariel Rosa : Hey. Good morning, Greg, Adam. First, really quickly, wanted to get, I don\u2019t know if I missed it in the press release, but just what was the cargo claims ratio and the on-time deliveries for the quarter? I know you usually provide that, but I think I missed it this quarter. Greg Gantt : It was in there \u2013 the on-time service was above 99%, slightly above 99% and the claims ratio was 0.2%. Ariel Rosa : Got it, okay. So pretty consistent with past quarters. Greg Gantt : Yes. Ariel Rosa : So just wanted to revert back to this question of the pricing competition and maybe discuss it from a slightly different angle. Maybe you could talk about what\u2019s your ability to maintain an operating ratio in the 80% range if we see that pricing competition kind of step up or if conditions deteriorate a little bit from where they are currently? Adam Satterfield : I think what you have to look at is how we\u2019ve performed in the past and 2016 was a flat revenue year for us and we lost 60 basis points on the OR that year and it was all on the depreciation line. And so that\u2019s about the headwind we had in the first quarter for depreciation, despite the fact that we improved the operating ratio and don\u2019t want to lose sight of the fact that we improved at 190 basis points in the first quarter and still produced above 20% growth in earnings. But certainly as the revenue slows, we go through and we\u2019re continuously \u2013 and this is a minute by minute, day by day process managing our labor costs with labor trends and then we just go up and down the income statement as well and look at if we\u2019ve got discretionary spending in some places that we can eliminate. That\u2019s exactly what we try to do, because at the end of the day our goal is to grow the profits of the company. And from a long-term standpoint, it certainly makes more sense for us to maintain our pricing discipline. We may lose a little bit of volume in the short run and that causes a little cost creep on a per shipment basis with things like overhead, in general, but certainly we\u2019ll continue to manage it and set the company up for long-term profitable growth. Ariel Rosa : Got it. That makes sense. And then, Adam, you mentioned that you see the industry is being somewhat capacity constrained. Just wanted to see if you could maybe give a little more color on what you mean there and what specifically you see as the constraint to that capacity expansion? Adam Satterfield : I think that\u2019s primarily on the service center side. And the reason we believe that is just looking at over the long run the number of shipments per day that, at least, the public carriers you can go through and review and how many shipments per day one is handling today versus yesteryear. The investments in capacity over time, which there haven\u2019t been a significant number of service center openings outside of us in one of our larger competitors. And that\u2019s the reason why you\u2019ve seen a lot of the market share consolidation concentrated in two main carriers over the years. So it takes investing in door capacity to be able to grow the business and with an industry that still operating with mid-single digit profit margins, then making those investments may not always make sense and that\u2019s probably why we\u2019ve not seen any significant measure of capacity investments. So it\u2019s something that we don\u2019t necessarily hear others talk about. We feel good about our measure of spare capacity and generate and our ability to grow. I think that we\u2019re still probably in the 15% to 20% range when it comes to the spare capacity of our service center network, but that\u2019s probably closer to the where we got on the lower-end of that scale last year, given the investments that we\u2019ve made through last year and this first quarter and some of this softness will probably back up to about the 20% end of that range now. So that\u2019s a good thing for us. And that\u2019s why we want to keep adding to the capacity, because, if you recall, we like to keep a measure of about 25% in place. So if that capacity measure continues to increase for us, certainly we feel better in that regard in having the system setup and designed for when the growth returns to the business. Ariel Rosa : Got it. That\u2019s a great answer. Thanks for the color there. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Just surprisingly expanding on the price commentary. So I guess everyone\u2019s memory goes back to 2009, 2010 timeframe, but we obviously had a pretty big industrial recession in 2015 and 2016 as well. Did you see a similar small breakdown or any breakdown in industry pricing at this point in 2016, because your performance, as you said earlier, Adam, was held up very well around that time? I just want to compare and contrast and just make sure I\u2019m not misunderstanding the severity of your pricing comment. Adam Satterfield : I think that the \u2013 pretty much the first half of 2016, we saw a little bit increased competitiveness and it was pretty selective and I think rationalized by the end of the year. And so, it wasn\u2019t broad-based then, and there is nothing that\u2019s broad-based now. It\u2019s certainly \u2013 and that we\u2019re spending a lot of your air time talking about it. We still saw a very nice increase in both the revenue per hundredweight and revenue per shipment in the first quarter, certainly believe that that strength continue into the second quarter, but we don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s broad-based at this point that should cause too much panic. But certainly we\u2019re starting to see it and that\u2019s why we mentioned it and just want to get it out there, but we would expect and intend to completely maintain our same approach that we always have and that\u2019s an approach with our customers that\u2019s based on consistency and based on our cost inflation and the need to continue to have both cost increases to support the ongoing investments and capacity that our customers demand from us, as well as investments in some of the technological tools that we\u2019re being asked to deliver on as well that not only can help us manage cost but can help our customers eliminate cost as well. Amit Mehrotra : Yes. And just related to that, this piece I guess pocket is maybe the better way to think about it or phrase it, pockets of price competitiveness, is it more carrier-driven related to specific expansion plans and maybe a heightened fixed cost structure that they have or is it more customer-driven? I guess it goes hand-in-hand, but more customer-driven as \u2013 maybe customers look to trade down to more economy or price \u2013 or more price sensitive and the volume environment, any bifurcation there? Greg Gantt : I think what we\u2019re seeing \u2013 we\u2019re seeing our customers shop, because they think the environment is favorable to get lower rates and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing there in some cases and that\u2019s some of the business that\u2019s crept away from us. It\u2019s just been opportunistic. Competitors taken the decrease that we weren\u2019t willing to take. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen so far. It\u2019s early in the game and we\u2019ll see where that goes. But, so far, like Adam said, it\u2019s not broad-based, it\u2019s just a few places here and there, but it\u2019s still more than we\u2019ve seen the past couple of years. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Adam, one housekeeping one for me. The salaries, wages and benefits in the quarter per employee, it took a bigger step down than I would have just imagine given some of the upward pressure on the fringe costs you called out last quarter. Can you just talk about that, I mean, from a \u2013 just what you did to manage that to bring it down year-over-year and how should we think about the rest of the year from a compensation benefits per employee? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I mentioned that from a productive labor standpoint, that was about 60 basis points of that overall improvement that we had. Our fringe benefit costs, in general, were pretty close with where we were in the first quarter and we did have a rebound with some of that retirement plan and expense of the phantom share program that we\u2019ve had, but we had a similar increase last year. Actually I guess the expense that we\u2019ve recorded for that program was about $2.5 million less in the first quarter of 2019 versus where it was in the first quarter of 2018 But otherwise it\u2019s just been a process of going through and, in some cases working fewer hours, evaluating positions, the needs maybe deferring on some of the planned additions and just going through and looking at and evaluating how we can best manage those costs and that\u2019s a process that we\u2019ve really undertook late last year and that continues. But that\u2019s an ongoing thing and that\u2019s a big reason why we\u2019ve been able to produce or we\u2019re able to produce last year, so maybe operating ratio. You\u2019ve got to manage cost in good times and in bad times and certainly that\u2019s what we always stay focused on every day. Amit Mehrotra : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Greg Gantt : Good morning, Scott. Adam Satterfield : Good morning. Scott Group : Adam, can you actually give us what the April revenue per day is doing? And then I don\u2019t know if I got the March tonnage number, if you can give that. And then on April can you say if tonnage is still negative, I presume it is but can you just sort of directionally talk there? Adam Satterfield : I\u2019ll give you the March was \u2013 the weight per day was down 1.2% on a year-over-year basis and shipment were up 3.1% on a year-over-year basis. And so, for April, very similar to what we talked about on last quarter\u2019s call. We are going to wait until the full month is finished versus having a conversation about interim numbers and then how that reconcile to final numbers. So once we get through with the month, we\u2019ll publish those details. But, just directionally, what we\u2019ve seen is where shipments in the first quarter averaged a little over 2.5% increase, they flattened out in April. And so that\u2019s really what\u2019s caused the revenue growth to compress a little bit, the yield trend, as we said earlier, is continuing to hold steady with the same type of increase that we saw in the first quarter, and that\u2019s what you would expect. I mean, certainly the answer that I gave earlier where you intend for a little bit of compression was just really related to how the prior-year number was changing and how it was accelerating as we progress through the quarter and some of that was mix driven. But just looking at the actual revenue per hundredweight number that we produced in the first quarter and kind of carrying that through into the second quarter with some slight increase would generate a little bit of compression, but we\u2019re still seeing the accounts that are turning over, we\u2019re getting good increases on, we did just push through our general rate increase that will become effective in May this year versus June of last year, so that will help, and we\u2019re just going to continue to stay focused on managing the operating ratio for each account on an account-by-account basis and that\u2019s been successful for us in the past. Scott Group : Okay. And just to put some of these pricing competitive things in context, maybe, can you share what your pricing renewals, where they\u2019re tracking right now? Adam Satterfield : We don\u2019t give that level of detail, but it\u2019s certainly, we talked about the fact that it\u2019s cost base type pricing. Our cost, excluding fuel, in the first quarter were up 4.4% to be exact and we targeted, and I think we talked about this on the last call, a cost inflation, excluding fuel, and about the 4.5% range was our expectation going into this year. And I think we can continue to stay on that pace, that becomes the basis, but above that long-term we\u2019ve had about 80 \u2013 somewhere between 50 to 100 basis point delta in terms of what our cost inflation is and then the add-on for what the revenue per shipment has changed. And, again, when we talk about it, you\u2019ve got to have the contribution from yield to cover the cost inflation, but there is also got to be something there to support the level of capital expenditures. It takes to grow our network and make these investments that we have over time. If we hadn\u2019t done this, obviously we wouldn\u2019t been able to achieve the growth that we have over the last few years and certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve the top line growth that we think we are still capable of going forward. Scott Group : And the competitive environment you\u2019re talking about, is that put that 80 to 100 basis points of sort of real pricing, is that at risk now? Or are you still able to get that in terms of what you\u2019re seeing in the market right now? Adam Satterfield : We\u2019ve been pretty successful in the first quarter with getting the rate increases that we felt like we\u2019ve needed. And I think we talked about last year and this goes back to our management on the account-by-account basis. Last year, we manage our accounts on account level profitability and some of the underperforming accounts last year we were able to get more increases on to maybe \u2013 they may have been staggered or we may have faced pressure on a particular account back in 2016. So we addressed some of those, but obviously the environment we were able to get nice increases last year and some of that was embedded in this \u2013 the 9.5% increase that we\u2019re seeing on the hundredweight basis now still just a continuation of some of the increases from last year and that mix type of change that\u2019s embedded in there. But we\u2019ve been very successful so far this year with the increases and I think that it\u2019s a lot easier to have conversations with customers that are cost-driven in what we\u2019re facing than it is just sitting down across the table and having a conversation about what the environment is like. I\u2019d rather asked be based on what our service level metrics are with the account, what we can give them in terms of capacity, what we can give the account in terms of technology those types of conversations are more relationship-based and they are just being the commodity. Scott Group : Okay. And then just last one. So, in 2016, when we last talked about this sort of pricing dynamic, we all sort of talked about one carrier, is it different this time around? Adam Satterfield : I think like what Greg said, it\u2019s definitely not one person that is driving this, it\u2019s just a couple of players in specific places that are going out and maybe being slightly more aggressive, but it\u2019s certainly not anything that\u2019s focused on one particular person in one particular area, and it\u2019s not anything that\u2019s been overly aggressive I\u2019ll say at this point either. I just think it\u2019s been very selective in certain places and we\u2019ll see as other carriers produce the \u2013 release their results for the quarter and as we progress to the second quarter, if \u2013 what the impact on profitability is. Because we\u2019ve talked in the past of 1% decrease in price, typically takes about 5% or so improvement in volumes to just offset from a bottom line standpoint. So the price for volume gain has not played out over the long run and certainly not something that we want to play. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Apologies for following up on this topic here, but I think it\u2019s important to clarify. Adam, I think you said earlier in the call that the pricing competition was broad-based and I think you just also confirmed that it wasn\u2019t restricted to just a few players, but then you also said later on that it was not broad-based. Can you just help us understand this, are you saying this is multiple players but only in certain regions or/and with certain customers? Adam Satterfield : I apologize if I \u2013 maybe I said it incorrectly, but it is not broad-based, it\u2019s not something that\u2019s pervasive. It\u2019s not in any particular region, it\u2019s just few carriers. Here they \u2013 and I say a few meaning that it\u2019s not one but it is not everyone, it\u2019s been just here and there and kind of everywhere and it\u2026 Greg Gantt : Selected accounts. Adam Satterfield : Yes. Greg Gantt : Certain accounts, not broad-based all over accounts. Just certain accounts. Ravi Shanker : Okay, got it. And your experience with this, I mean is this usually how it starts before it kind of snowballs or do you think that the industry right now is disciplined enough that this going to be nipped in the bud? Adam Satterfield : I think that it will be something that won\u2019t play out and our belief \u2013 and go back to 2016 where that was a slower environment. Our belief then and our belief now is when you\u2019ve got an industry that\u2019s capacity constrained, it\u2019s a very consolidated industry with 80% or more other revenue now in the top 10 players and the industry\u2019s operating ratio is still in the mid-single digit range that that\u2019s not really a setup that would support multiple carriers getting aggressive with pricing. When you go back in time when there has been more of a difference in price wars and so forth you had multiple players that may have been in a little healthier position financially, but I think that over the last decade it\u2019s been proving, especially when you look at our results that if you have a disciplined approach with pricing that can lead to margin improvement. And so, we would certainly expect to not see any kind of broad-based or deep discounting or anything like that to play out. And at the end of the day, the environment is still positive, the macro environment is still positive. GDP is still growing. I think consumer information is still positive, industrial information is still positive. So the overall macroeconomic backdrop is still good and the conversations that we\u2019ve had with customers, we\u2019ve got customers that are still anticipating growing their businesses. So everything overall from that backdrop standpoint is positive and I think, perhaps, what you\u2019ve seen is in the first quarter, there\u2019s a lot of discussion about the impact of weather, on revenue trends and so forth and so maybe some people fail behind the curve a little bit with volumes and now we\u2019re just seeking to go out and fill up whatever measure of capacity that may have had before. And so, they\u2019re looking at certain lanes and trying to get some freight in those lanes. We\u2019re not sure what some of the other players are seeing in and I guess we\u2019ll see that in the next couple of weeks, but it\u2019s certainly not something that we would expect to see any kind of massive discounting in anyway. Ravi Shanker : Understood. That\u2019s really helpful. I \u2013 just finally, apologies if I missed this, but did you give what your excess capacity is right now? Adam Satterfield : Closer to the 20% range now, probably still in the 15% to 20% kind of ballpark, but closer to the 20% now. Ravi Shanker : Got it. And just so that we can dimension it, if you were to pull back on, like, all of your growth investments, whether it\u2019s a discretionary stuff, whether it\u2019s stack or additional capacity, how much will that add to your OR approximately? Greg Gantt : If we were to pull back \u2013 we\u2019re not planning on pulling back on our real estate. Ravi Shanker : I know, but if you were \u2013 I mean, let\u2019s say the world fell apart in the next six months, I\u2019m just \u2013 I mean, just so that we can kind of dimension that just how much defensive, like a cushion you have in your OR right now? Adam Satterfield : We\u2019re not going to give any color on that. I think that when you look at the depreciation and how it trends, we \u2013 obviously, we\u2019ve had a little bit of a headwind, 60 basis points in the first quarter. Much of the OR impact is going to be what the top line does, but there is \u2013 if you go through in just sort of look and anticipate where that overall CapEx plan is then obviously from a real dollar standpoint you\u2019re going to see increases from there and I\u2019ll let you figure out the OR impact based on what\u2019s your forecast for revenue for the rest of the year will be. Ravi Shanker : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Brooklier with Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead. Kyle Robinson : Hi. This is Kyle Robinson on for Matt Brooklier. I got some question about expenses. We\u2019ll talk about the revenue side of the weather and how it impacted things, but I was just curious if you guys can make the \u2013 any potential insurance claims or fleet management expenses coming up in the next quarter maybe because of the difficulty of weather in the freezing and floating? Adam Satterfield : Our insurance line typically averages somewhere from just call it around 1.2% of revenue, 1.1% to 1.3%. That\u2019s pretty consistent in the first three quarters of the year. Those two line items include our cargo claims ratio which we talk about every quarter and that\u2019s generally between 0.2% to 0.3% and then that just call it a 1% delta, that\u2019s the auto claims that we have for truck and so forth. And so that\u2019s pretty consistent. And then we have an annual true up in the fourth quarter of every year, where we go through an actuarial process. So there shouldn\u2019t be any material changes as we progress through the first three quarters of the year, certainly wouldn\u2019t anticipate thinking of that change in any material way as we continue to manage the cargo claims ratio with the all-time low levels like they have been. Kyle Robinson : Great. Thank you. I appreciate the color. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ben Hartford with Baird. Please go ahead. Ben Hartford : Hey. Good morning, guys. Adam, did the cash balances built over the past couple of years, debt levels are low, free cash has improved, is there any business reason to maintain this level of net cash balance or could we see an acceleration in capital returns. Just how are you thinking about that cash management strategy? Adam Satterfield : Well, a couple of different ways. One, we obviously want to \u2013 the first priority is always going to be investing in our sales and like what we\u2019ve discussed earlier we\u2019ll continue to look at opportunities on the real estate side, and we certainly don\u2019t necessarily have any kind of goal per se to continue to build cash on the balance sheet. But with position of strength, if opportunities present themselves, as other carriers may look to sell properties and generate some cash flow that those that may be facing significant levels of debt or have other capital needs in the past, that\u2019s been an opportunity for us, and that could accelerate. And certainly we take advantage of any opportunities that might present. I think looking out over the longer term, we\u2019ve still got a terminal list of about 40 properties or so that areas where we think we need a service center at some point. And so if something becomes available and fits the bill for where we\u2019d want to be, we\u2019d certainly take advantage of that opportunity. And then from a capital return to shareholders standpoint, certainly I think that\u2019s something that we can increase, we increased the dividend going into this year and we given out a little bit more dollars in that program and then from the share buyback standpoint. When you go back and look in the fourth quarter, we stepped up our purchases there when the price declined. And so, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll continue to monitor as the price fluctuates, and we can certainly step up just in general some of those purchases and that may be something that we do. But certainly our program in the past has been to buy more when the share price is lower and I think that we continue that type of mentality going forward. Ben Hartford : Is there a way to think about what the average cost per service center is to build of the 40 that you have remaining? I know each one is going to be different, but is there an average cost per new service center that you could share? Greg Gantt : The service centers themselves averages doesn\u2019t vary all that much from place to place, it\u2019s typically the land where you have the big variances. But the average cost of building is not all that different from place to place. Ben Hartford : Right. And then the total cost to develop a property, is there an average, is there a rule of thumb that we can think about? Adam Satterfield : We\u2019ve got\u2026 Ben Hartford : Including the land. Including the land. Adam Satterfield : The land cost, that\u2019s the biggest variable, as Greg said. We\u2019d rather not give what our cost is, but there is a general sort of cost per door that target that we have and we\u2019d rather not share that level of detail, but the biggest variance is the land cost. And you can have same property in Kansas versus the LA area, and the LA will be in the tens of millions of dollars, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re starting to see and while we\u2019ve talked about some of the investments out West and in the Northeast. Those two markets in particular, the service center cost, cost to have a facility, and it\u2019s more of the embedded land cost is significant. And in the Northeast, in particular, it takes a long time to grow and defined available properties there. There is many cases where we\u2019ve got a targeted need and it may take years to \u2013 before you find a suitable location and an available location to be able to move into. So that\u2019s why we try to stay so far ahead of our growth curve, particularly in those areas, the metro areas [indiscernible] land, out in California, those are areas that we definitely got to stay upfront for. Your network ends up becoming a limiting factor to your growth and certainly we don\u2019t want that happen. Ben Hartford : Understood. And the last one, is your perspective around acquisitions changed at all or still the emphasis very strongly continuing to penetrate share organically in LTL? Greg Gantt : That\u2019s certainly \u2013 our top priority is to continue to grow our share. To invest in our sales and continue to grow our share, that\u2019s our top priority at this point. Ben Hartford : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Greg Gantt : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey, guys. I\u2019m all set. Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions. I\u2019ll turn the conference back to Greg Gantt for closing remarks. Greg Gantt : Thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions, and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and I hope you all have a great day.",

As a final note, before we begin, we welcome your questions today, but ask, in fairness to all, that you limit yourself to just a couple of questions at a time before returning to the queue. We thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir. Greg Gantt : Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me on the call today is David Congdon, our Executive Chairman; and Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. I am pleased to report the OD team delivered solid operating results and financial results for the second quarter of 2019 including several new company records. We recorded our highest quarterly revenue of $1.1 billion and our highest quarterly earnings per diluted share of $2.16. We also improved on our industry-leading operating ratio by 80 basis points to 77.9%. While we have seen general softness with demand and the economy continues to give us mixed signals, we believe we are continuing to win market share and are maintaining our price discipline while doing so. Our ability to win market share even in slower periods is based on our superior service offering delivered at a fair price. Our on-time service performance was 99% in the second quarter while our cargo claims ratio remained at 0.2%. In addition to providing these superior service metrics, we also improved the productivity of our operations. Our P&D shipments per hour improved 1.6% in the second quarter, while our dock shipments per hour increased 5.4%. Our line-haul latent load average decreased by 1.6% but this metric was affected by the decrease in weight per shipment. This service and productivity metrics reflect our team's outstanding execution of our long-term strategic plan. I have been particularly pleased with the flexibility of our team and our business plan over the past couple of years. We responded to the material acceleration in volumes that occurred in late 2017 through 2018 and are now responding to lower than originally anticipated volumes this year. Managing through both the ups and downs of the business cycle is not easy. So the consistency in our service and financial results has been remarkable. We have never wavered from our commitment to service despite the associated costs due to the support it provides for our ability to maintain price discipline. The importance of yield to our financial results couldn't be more apparent than it was in the second quarter. We have said many times before that the keys to producing long-term margin improvement include a combination of density and yield with the support of a positive economy and stable pricing environment. Although macroeconomic conditions were not ideal, the strength of our yield performance and improved productivity, more than offset the loss of density and operating leverage during the second quarter, which has allowed us to improve our operating ratio to a new company record. As we look forward to the second half of 2019, we will continue to focus on controlling our cost, we anticipate the softer demand to continue, although it is important to note that we are well positioned to respond to any acceleration in volumes that might occur if the domestic economy regains momentum. Regardless of economic environment, we will continue to execute our long-term strategic plan by providing our customers with superior on-time claims free service at a fair price. We will also continue to make significant investments in capacity, technology and training and education of our OD family of employees. While these investments may increase expenses in the short run, we have demonstrated how our ongoing investment in our sales is critical to achieving long-term market share with solid returns. Consistent execution on our business fundamentals has helped us create one of the strongest records of growth and profitability in the LTL industry during periods of both economic expansion and contraction. As a result, we are confident in our ability to continue winning market share, as well as long-term prospects for further profitable growth and increase shareholder value. Thanks for joining us this morning. And now Adam will discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue increased 2.6% to $1.1 billion for the second quarter. The combination of the increase in revenue and 80 basis point improvement in our operating ratio allowed us to increase our diluted earnings per share by 8.5% to $2.16. Our revenue growth for the quarter was driven by the 9.5% improvement in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Our LTL tons per day decreased 6.3% as compared to the second quarter of 2018 with LTL shipments per day decreasing 2.6%. These decreases reflect the softer environment for freight, and we also believe that some volume loss was due to our long-term consistent approach to pricing. We expect our LTL weight per shipment in the second half of 2019 to be more consistent with the same period of last year which will also have an effect on our revenue per hundredweight. On a sequential basis, the trends for both LTL tons per day and LTL shipments per day for both below normal seasonality in the second quarter. As compared to the first quarter of 2019, LTL tons per day increased 2.9% as compared to the 10-year average increase of 8.2% and LTL shipments per day increased 3.7% as compared to the 10-year average increase of 7.5%. For July, our volumes are trending below normal seasonality, although our yield trend is holding steady in terms of the actual reported revenue per hundredweight. We expect that our volumes to be a little weaker, based on how the first month of each quarter has trended since July of last year, as well as the way the holiday fell this year. The actual growth rate in our revenue per hundredweight is lower than the first half of this year. However, due to tougher comparisons with the third quarter of 2018, a decrease in the growth rate was expected and we want to ensure that this is a no way misinterpreted as a change to our long-term pricing philosophy. We will continue to target increases that offset our cost inflation while also supporting our continued investments in technology and service center capacity. We will provide actual revenue related details for July and our second quarter Form 10-Q. Our second quarter operating ratio improved 80 basis points to 77.9% as a 110 basis point improvement in our direct operating cost as a percent of revenue more than offset the increase in overhead expenses. Greg detailed the improvements in productivity, which resulted in a 70 basis point improvement in our productive labor cost. Operating supplies and expenses also improved 80 basis points, primarily due to lower fuel costs. Our aggregate overhead cost as a percent of revenue increased 30 basis points, primarily due to the 40 basis point increase in our depreciation costs given the significant investments we have made in capacity and technology and the deleveraging effect of lower revenues we expect our overhead costs to be pressured as a percent of revenue for the remainder of the year. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $255.7 million and $461.9 million for the second quarter and first half of 2019 respectively, while capital expenditures were $159.2 million and $230 million for the same periods. We continue to expect total capital expenditures of approximately $480 million for this year. We returned $147.8 million of capital to our shareholders during the second quarter and $192.2 million for the first half of the year. For the year-to-date period, this total consisted of $164.7 million in share repurchases and $27.4 million in cash dividends. With the increase in repurchases during the second quarter, we completed our prior $250 million repurchase facility approximately one year ahead of schedule and began our new $350 million 2-year program. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 was 26.1% as compared to 26.2% in the second quarter of 2018. We currently anticipate our annual effective tax rate to be 26.1% for the third quarter of 2019. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we're happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison Landry : If I wanted to ask one about pricing from the first quarter call when you mentioned that at least on the fringes that you're seeing a little bit of a rational or aggressive behavior from some of your competitors. I just wanted to get an update on that. If that's something that you saw persist in the second quarter, if there's been any sort of change in the pricing landscape. It sounds like the yields -- yields are remaining steady but curious on the competitive side? Adam Satterfield : Yes, Allison this is Adam and we still see it is pretty consistent with last quarter. And I think that when you look at our yield trends, certainly they were very consistent with the first quarter as well. And I'll point out we said in our prepared remarks on the first quarter call that we view the environment is stable and things went, maybe a little sideways as part of the Q&A, but we continue to view things stable and we're still getting consistent increases in our contractual renewals and so forth and still seeing our increases offsetting our cost inflation, which is the primary target that we go after each year is a contract is renewing. Allison Landry : And then on the resource side since you guys were really ramping up on hiring through most of 2018 and now that demand levels are quite a bit softer. Do you think that your sort of over resource and you need to rightsize that a bit, and how should we think about that in the second half in terms of headcount levels and what impact that may have on productivity. Thank you. Greg Gantt : Allison, we have made the necessary cuts to re-establish our labor at tonnage levels but that we -- working currently working, but we have made those adjustments. Obviously, we did if you look at our productivity gains, you can't do that without making the labor adjustments. So we feel pretty good about where we are going through the quarter and business conditions will dictate what we do with labor going forward. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Congrats on the -- a big congrats I should say on operating performance in the quarter. So I just wanted to ask about the weight per shipment comps, they obviously get easier and they started to get easier, but shipments have now taken a bit of a step down and Adam. I'm just curious about as you guys manage your cost structure, does the shipment driven decline in tonnage better allow you to adjust the cost structure. And if you could just talk about maybe your ability to protect profitability if tonnage declines or just being more disproportionately driven by shipments as opposed to weight per shipment? Adam Satterfield : Shipments, there is something we've been trying to talk more about this year just given the disparity with the weight per shipment and the changes we saw from in the first half of 2018 compared to the second half, but I think you can already see what the response has been and we feel good that we saw some of the slowing last year and I felt like we got a little bit ahead of the cost curve that we -- our shipments were still trending positive in the first quarter of this year, they turned to negative. But we talked about our headcount coming in alignment with our change in shipments and if you look now and compare our headcount where we were at the end of June versus where we were at the end of September, we 're down right at 4%, just that one point versus the other. And when you look at the change in shipments per day and the second quarter of 2019 versus the third quarter of 2018, we\u2019re down in a similar type of range, we\u2019re down about 4%, so we've got the headcount, pretty much in alignment with where shipments are as Greg just said, and I think in doing so, certainly we saw the improvement in productivity as we progress through this quarter and our direct cost performance, as I mentioned, it's really been great. So we're seeing that improvement our productive labor cost, we'll get some improvement some operating supplies and expenses and some of that fuel driven, but that's been able to more than offset the loss of leverage that we've seen in overhead costs. Amit Mehrotra : Yes, and then would you just related to that, I would have imagine you have some opportunity on the overtime side on the hour side and we didn't really see that come through. Just given salaries, wages and benefits per employee were actually up a little bit. I don't know if that partly related to some inflation and fringe costs in the phantom shares. But if you could just talk about your ability to maybe control hours prospectively from here, just given the decline in the revenue trends? Adam Satterfield : I think that's what -- that benefit that we\u2019re seeing so in our productive labor costs. Just the labor component has improved 70 basis points, as we talked about, but we did see a little bit of inflation if you will, and our fringe benefit costs during the period compared. So we talked about, and I mentioned I think going into this year that I anticipated fringe rate around 34% and that's about where we were in the second quarter last year. Our fringe rate was 32.8%, so we had a little bit lost there and some of that was just, we had a little bit of favorability in the quarter last year. And on the overhead side of our labor cost, it's pretty flat from an overall standpoint a percent of revenue, and that's because a lot of our compensation is performance-based and so without the same type of growth -- maybe some of the metrics we saw last year, that's a little bit lower. And it's just -- they're kind of coming out in the wash versus fixed salaries and so forth and then that performance rate base. Amit Mehrotra : Right, and just one quick follow-up if I could just on pricing, I mean, you've talked about yield. But, Adam, I was just hoping you could parse out within that yield what's actual same-store pricing, so to speak. And what's the, because it is a little bit tough to figure out, because of the weight per shipment and then to slight increase in length of all not much but slight. Just trying to understand what the kind of core pricing is within that yield number? Adam Satterfield : Yes, we stopped given that contractual renewal number, primarily because I think that for us and maybe some of the other carriers as well and never necessarily seem to reconcile into what the components are, but you know what I'll say is we always target revenue per shipment, that's what we're looking at is the shipments we handle and the revenue for those shipments and then the cost per shipment and we're still getting our renewals kind of in our long-term target range. That's 80 basis points to 100 sort of north of cost inflation and we always we go through, we look at what we anticipate cost inflation is going to be on a per shipment basis each year. And then we need that extra as we talked about with the ongoing and continuous investments in our real estate network and in our technology systems that where we try to drive operating efficiencies. So we've continue to get increases. There are not a strong necessarily is what we saw last year, but we didn't expect that coming into this year. You know our pricing philosophy is more on account-by-account basis in each accounts operating ratio should stand on its own and some of those lower performing accounts we got higher increases last year that we didn't necessarily think which should repeat. So, I feel good about the way our renewals are trending and certainly that's showing up, and is the big reason why I mean Greg said in his comments, but the yield performance is what drove this record setting quarter for us both in revenue or in EPS. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Chris Wetherbee : Maybe could I ask you just to run through what the tonnage numbers look like in the month of June, I don't know if you had mentioned that before, but it looks like they step down a little bit from what the quarter-to-date had been through May. Just curious what that number was? Adam Satterfield : Sure, yes, on the tonnage side, we had a 7% decrease in tons and the month of June and that was after a 5.8% decrease in both April and May. And then on the shipment side we had a 3.4% decrease in shipments per day in June. And that followed a 2.1% decrease in April, and a 1.9% decrease in May. Chris Wetherbee : And the July commentary, although you don't give the number, the suggestion was the transition from 2Q to 3Q, is a little weaker than typical seasonality would suggest? Adam Satterfield : It is and it seems like this trend is been in place now for the last several quarters. But I think that our revenue trends have been really consistent as we progress through the quarter, but we kind of start this first month out of the quarter, below normal seasonality and it's been that way since going back to July of last year. And so, we've been pretty well below in January in April this year. And so, but what we've seen is a consistency from the start to the year-end, so we would expect to see things continue to build. The July has a negative set up and, like I mentioned, we expected to see it a little bit weaker, just the way all the days fail with regard to the holiday and continued through the month, but I would expect to see it pick up - kind of back above seasonality in August. Chris Wetherbee : And then just, mechanically, as we think about the, the revenue per hundredweight that you report and the relationship with the weight per shipment. I think you mentioned that weight per shipment is going to begin to sort of move towards comparability or flat relative to the second half of last year. This is mechanically, that has sort of a negative impact on the revenue per hundredweight growth. Can we just sort of walk us through, remind us sort of that relationship. Is it one for one, as you see that sort of decline start to normalize the impact on the revenue per hundredweight ? Adam Satterfield : There is no completely linear way to track and to adjust for weight per shipment and the other mix changes you've got length of haul-in-class of freight that impact that reported metric as well, but typically, and we're still seeing the increases, like I mentioned on contracts that are renewing in and there is no one renewal period for us. They're renewing and we're evaluating contracts every day as they come up so we would expect and historically it's shown that you'd expect to see holding mix constant a little bit of an increase, going into the third quarter out of the second. And so with that said, and based on the acceleration that we saw from 2Q to 3Q last year, just assuming a little normal acceleration in the actual reported number in the second quarter going into the third has been that may change that growth rate metric somewhere between the 5% to 6% type of range versus where we've been double digit this year. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : So, just another question on the tonnage here, I mean your tonnage doesn't run negative for very long. I mean, if you go back the last 15 years, it's going to usually for like four quarters in a row. I think you already at that level, does it feel like tonnage is going to imminently flip positive in the second half and going into 2020 or do you feel like the macro environment is to still far too uncertain to make that call? Adam Satterfield : It's still feels a little bit soft and a lower comparisons, get a little bit easier in the last part of the year but it feels a little softer. So, we don't expect our tonnage to flip to positive but it hopefully at the macro pickup and we'll have a better end than we expect. But right now, it just appears to be a little bit soft. Consistent, that's the good thing. It is really consistent day to day. But just not seeing the levels that would certainly that we did last year this time. Greg Gantt : And, Ravi I'll just add, it's when you look at all the macroeconomic numbers that that we pay attention to, particularly on the industrial side, it's still showing growth, but certainly that hasn't reconciled to freight across the transportation landscape I'd say it's not just us, but there is - it's been hard to read the tea leaves because you've got a lot of metrics that suggest positive trends and maybe not as strong as certainly is what we were seeing last year but still all showing positive. And I think the one bright spot in everything is the fact that the consumer is still healthy and so there's a lot of good economic data on that, if you will and so in that regard consumers keep consuming somebody has got to produce and ultimately ship that free. Ravi Shanker : And just maybe the follow-up to that, when you think of what your OR has historically done kind of in those negative tonnage environmentally in 2016 your OR deteriorated but so far you've kept it improving. Again you spoke of a number of initiatives that you're putting in place, but is your messaging here that you can continue to keep improving the OR even a negative tonnage environment again, obviously, if you go into recession all bets are off, but if it continues in the current environment, the OR can keep improving even with the tougher comps that you have? Greg Gantt : Ravi we've done it now for a couple of quarters and I think that I was pleased with the sequential operating ratio performance from the first quarter into the second. Operating ratio improved 410 basis points and the long-term average is 440. So comparing back to periods where we've had slower revenue growth, it's sort of been in 350 basis points kind of range so feel good about our cost trends. They are - typically the third quarter is very consistent with the second-and long-term the operating ratio is typically up 20 to 30 basis points and so, I feel good with what we've done with respect to our cost. Certainly, we've got a few other things that we can focus on with respect to saving some money and protecting some of the cost there, but even at its worst kind of going back into some of the periods in 2009 and 2015, that was a 60 basis point increase though we still certainly got more or room rather in terms of where we were last year in the third quarter to show some slight OR improvement and that's definitely the goal for us is to continue to try to protect the bottom line to grow our earnings and improve the operating ratio. Ravi Shanker : And then last one from me, IMO 2020 is around the proverbial corner. How are you guys thinking about that and maybe any ripple effects through the transportation space when that does happen ? Greg Gantt : I think at this point we're going to take the wait-and-see approach. I mean we obviously, we are prepared for growth if it comes back. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we have continued to execute on our gaming capacity. Our plan to gain capacity so, I think we're in a good spot. If in fact it's better than we expected it to be, so if it's not we'll make adjustments then proceed accordingly. Again, I think we've proven that we can make the adjustments that we need to make in a positive or in a negative environment. So hopefully, with what we've done, particularly in the last several quarters, you see that we are able to do it. So let's just hope that things pick up. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins : Greg, I guess, first one would be for you, just curious, any, I know you said things still feel kind of soft out there would be curious to know what you're hearing from your customers about their expected business trends in the second half of the year. I think UPS yesterday on their conference call so they expected industrial production to be slightly negative in the fourth quarter. You sort of aggregate your customer conversations over the past couple of months. How are you thinking about underlying business fundamentals heading into the second half of the year. Greg Gantt : Relatively positive honestly, for the most part, most of our major customers are fairly busy. So it seems to be from that standpoint positive and that makes you feel good. The other side of that is our things like our customers are extremely happy with our performance and what we're doing and I think that has put us in a very, very good position to continue to gain share as we go forward, but that is definitely a positive. Our customers do seem to be busy and that's a good thing for the industry in particular. Jack Atkins : Okay, that's helpful. And then following up on that Adam, you talked about July being a little bit below normal seasonality, but the expectation that August, so may be a little bit better than normal seasonality, as you think about the third quarter in aggregate from a tonnage perspective, is it your thought that we're kind of at the point now where we should as a whole kind of return back to more towards normal seasonality. When we think about 3Q versus 2Q or is it just too early to make that call ? Adam Satterfield : I don't think we want to give that guidance at this point but we'll continue to watch it and continue to adjust as we need to in handling the freight that we get. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : So Adam, your comment about weight per shipment flattening out, is that something you're seeing in July. Is that where you think you're going to get to in the second half and then is it flattening out because it's starting to move up sequentially or is it just flattening out because the comps are just a lot easier ? Adam Satterfield : The comp, if you recall last year in June our weight per shipment was about 1620 pounds and then by July it was about 1560 pounds and most of that related to, we were just getting in a lot of heavier weighted shipments truckloads spillover type of freights and we made some operational changes to try to control the exit of that freight versus letting it happen to us naturally. And so we saw an immediate effect on our weight per shipment then and we've kind of been in this sort of 1550 to kind of 1580-ish pound range flex and up and down and there is some seasonality aspect of that, but I'd say it's been pretty consistent this year, which has been another bright spot that we hadn't necessarily seen that going any lower that you might expect from a read on the economy per say. Scott Group : In terms of pricing, are you saying that the competitive pricing environment you start to see a little bit in first quarter's improving now or is it that it's the same, but we're not freaking out about it as much as maybe we reacted last quarter? And then, revenue per shipment has been growing 5%, 6% do you think that's sustainable in the back half of the year? Adam Satterfield : I would say, on your first question it's, we're still saying it's stable just like we did last year or last quarter rather, and certainly I think that that was coming off of 2 years of favorable very favorable environment. But, so it's very consistent with what we're seeing and from a revenue per shipment standpoint, I would say, ex-fuel, certainly that continues to be the target coming into this year we talked about our cost per shipment expectation of somewhere around 4.5% and so we want to continue to try to get increases on a revenue per shipment basis that are north of that we are and I think we'll continue to see that. Including fuel, though we do, we've seen it in the second quarter and it's definitely continued into July, where we're seeing fuel rates down versus where they were last year. So that will be a little bit of a headwind on that yield metric with the fuel and as well as just on top line revenue performance in general. Scott Group : And just real quick, I may have missed it, did you say if you think head count is going to be flat or down maybe up sequentially ? Adam Satterfield : Expected to stay somewhat flat through the third and fourth quarter. Operator : And our next question will come from Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Jason Seidl : In your non-industrial business were any of your customers talking about the tariffs impacting them in the first half of this year from a pull-forward perspective? Greg Gantt : Yes, certainly it\u2019s been a conversation point particularly customers we visited several weeks ago out on the West Coast [several] of us and heard a little bit more of it out there. But overall, our retail business continues to perform well for us and I think we've got a very good product many retailers that have been optimizing their supply chains, got programs in place that really favor high service carriers. And certainly, that's been a big benefit for us and we've seen good growth in that element of our business, we call it our most arrived by date business, but it's just managing the on-time and full type of programs that many retailers have put in place. So that's been good for us and has been a bright spot. Jason Seidl : So, it's safe to say that it's come up, but probably not really impacted the 1Q volumes that much? Adam Satterfield : Well, it's hard to say. I think there has been an impact there, but we're just continuing to gain market share that maybe is offset any individual customer that maybe feeling a little bit of pressure. But we're just, we're continuing to gain market share in that piece of our business. Jason Seidl : Also there has been some bankruptcies in the LTL side in the last 6 months. Have you guys picked up much freight from what you can tell from either of those bankruptcies? Greg Gantt : We have picked up some, but they were both very, very small, but we definitely did pick up some. We had kind of a flurry of phone calls and opportunities from the get-go. And I'm sure we've kept some of that business, but most probably all of the business that we initially took on. But they are very, very small so not a big impact, but we did get some. Jason Seidl : Not a big one, okay, and is that help keep pricing somewhat stable in the LTL world? Greg Gantt : Honestly, I'm not sure either of those were large enough to move the needle hold on. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ariel Rosa with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Ariel Rosa : So the first question I wanted to ask you just was about some of the capacity additions and the extent to which you think that might have a drag on the OR in the second half of 2019 or going into 2020. Certainly with incremental margins in the mid 40s and I think it went north of 50 this quarter. Maybe you could address what you think of - the sustainability of those levels given the capacity adds? Adam Satterfield : Some of that incremental margin is just a function of the way the math is working. And we've talked many times before about the fact that we don't manage the business to incremental margin. We're independently trying to put on revenue at a good OR and always trying to take cost out of the business. And I think in the first and second quarters this year, that cost element is certainly caused the benefit to that metric, but most of the capacity additions that we make, don't have a huge impact. And I\u2019m speaking of service center capacity that have a huge impact on that depreciation line. Certainly, the equipment cost have added depreciation to us and we were anticipating growth in shipments this year, and at least in the second quarter, we're seeing those down. So our fleet is probably a little heavy versus where we'd like it to be. And we cut $10 million out of our CapEx going into this quarter on the tractor side to help a little bit, but there is other carrying cost, besides the depreciation on the fleet. And we've seen some inflation there as a result. And some of that it kind of gets buried overall in the operating supplies and expenses, but there is certainly been some excess fleet maintenance costs there. As just we've got probably more tractors then we need at this point, but some of that will just transition as we go into 2020. And we'll be looking at what we think the demand environment and what our growth potential for that year will be and will somewhat get offset likely in our 2020 CapEx plan. Ariel Rosa : That's great color, actually leads well into my next question. So I wanted to talk a little bit about free cash flow conversion. Obviously, the net income numbers that you guys are putting up quite impressive. But the free cash flow is trailed about a little bit and that's obviously partly the nature of asset intensive businesses. But if there is a slowdown do you think there's a little bit of an opportunity to maybe improve that free cash flow conversion. And how much of an eye are you guys keeping on that? Greg Gantt : We'll it depends the easy answer to say, but one of the things that we look at will be what other opportunities may present themselves. And what we've seen in slower periods in the past is that gives us an opportunity to potentially accelerate some service center expansions and potentially some opportunities of existing facilities. And so we certainly are going to keep our eye open for those opportunities. We've got long-term market share of goals. And we think we've got a long runway of growth ahead of us in that regard and that will require significant investments in service center. So if we can accelerate some of that in a slower environment where in the past other carriers have made service centers available, then I think we would certainly look at it accelerating on that opportunity. Ariel Rosa : And just remind me, I think we talked about it last call, but remind me what's the target the long-term target in terms of where you might like to get to in terms of service center footprint? Greg Gantt : Yes, that constantly changes right now. I think we're at 235 service centers today and we kind of got a list of about 40 service centers or so. But you know as we've gone through time what we figured out as the company gets bigger, the network plan and configuration changes. And we've kind of figured out with growth that is more efficient for us to have multiple service centers and metro areas. We've been doing some other operational changes around some of our break bulk locations and managing break versus local freight. So there is multiple elements to it and we don't know what we don't know. So I think we get smarter as we go when it comes to the configuration and network, but we're trying to build it with optimizing efficiencies both in our line haul and our pickup delivery operations. So my guess is, as we approach the 275 it may be that looking out further on the growth curve that maybe it needs to be more than that. But that's just one of those things that right now we've got a line like the 275. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Fowler : I think that you typically put in the annual wage increase sometime during the third quarter, and I was wondering if you could share any expectations that you have from that for this year from a timing and magnitude standpoint? Greg Gantt : The same timing as always, we always give our annual wage increase effective the first Friday in September and that will be the same this year as well. Todd Fowler : And Greg just from a magnitude with the labor environments and with what you're expecting on the pricing side. Is that something maybe below where it's been in the past couple of years or how do we think about kind of the magnitude of what you'd be putting through this year? Greg Gantt : It's going to be somewhat similar, Todd. But I don't really want to talk about numbers exactly there, but it will be somewhat similar to what we've done in the past. Adam Satterfield : We haven't announced this internally yet, so we're not prepared to. Todd Fowler : You're not going to give us the first look that's fair but Adam so with the commentary on the sequential OR progression. I think you said typically 40 to 50 basis points of deterioration 3Q versus 2Q that's something that you would expect, or that would be embedded in kind of your thought process on kind of a typical seasonal change within the OR? Adam Satterfield : Correct. Todd Fowler : And then, Adam, you made the comment on the expectations for the fringe for the full year to be around 34% and it sounds like that\u2019s, you're in that range for 2Q. I think in the fourth quarter of 2018 you had. It's a really difficult comp on the fringe side. I know that we've got some of the year to play out, but can you help us think about anything that we should factor in for the second half on the fringe side that would make the benefit to be different than the 34% that you're thinking about or is that something that you think you've got pretty good line of sight into at this point. Adam Satterfield : Well, last year in the fourth quarter, we had several favorable adjustments and typically the operating ratio was about 200 basis points higher in the fourth quarter versus the third. Last year it was only 30 basis points higher. Some of that was we go through an annual process of actuarially evaluating our certain insurance reserves. And we had favorable adjustments in our workers' comp and our auto liability claims. And we just had several favorable adjustments similar to that that roll through that fringe line in the fourth quarter of last year. I think our fringe benefit rate was between 30% to 31% and that reflected some of that favorability in the workers' comp. I think we had favorable group health trends in that quarter and then favorable phantom stock adjustment as well. So we just had a lot of favorability that rolled through that quarter and you never know which way some of those actuarial adjustments are going to go. And that's why when you look at kind of that fourth quarter, while I mentioned the second and third quarter is very, very consistent year-in and year-out. There is more variability from that third to fourth quarter for that reason. Todd Fowler : But for a starting point, it sounds like we should think about fourth quarter sequentially versus third quarter and be careful for doing fourth quarter year-over-year comparison. Just given the number of benefits in the fourth quarter of last year? Adam Satterfield : Right would necessarily expect those to, can go either way. Todd Fowler : Right. Adam Satterfield : But would necessarily expect - all of them come in, in the same magnitude and all in the same direction like they did last year that was a very unusual, when you look at that third to fourth quarter of 2018 type of performance. Todd Fowler : Well Greg let wish in the tonnage comes back, we won't have to worry too much about those things, I guess so? Greg Gantt : None of us. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Matthew Brooklier with Buckingham Research. Matthew Brooklier : Just going back to service centers. I think you talked previously this year about opening or expanding on 6 to 10 locations, Adam. I'm just curious to hear your thoughts about that number. If we're going to be at the higher end or lower end and if you have the service center count for first quarter that would be great? Adam Satterfield : At the end of the first quarter or we're currently sitting at 235 service centers is what our current count is and just based on completion schedules. We think that we'll finish another 6 service centers this year. But as we talked about I think on our last quarter call some of those service centers we may just defer the actual opening of those facilities until we start getting into the normal ramp of freight in the spring of next year. So they will be finished and we'll be ready. Just may not be that we pull drivers and staff them up and so forth just keep things as they are and then move the operation in early 2020. Matthew Brooklier : So, even with lower tonnage levels you still committed, it sounds like to opening up more service centers, just the timing maybe a little bit, a little bit different than you had previously thought entering the year? Adam Satterfield : Of that total six, two or three of those will probably just be open and will be open for business. But once you're committed and in these projects they fit in the long-term plan and that some of what we've talked about. Our long-term plan is just that it's for the long term. And we think we've got plenty of revenue growth opportunity. The decisions we're making now are going to be helping us for the next several years. And much like the investments we made in 2016 when freight was slower. Had we not made those expansion projects in the real estate team completing the projects when they did. We certainly wouldn't have been in a position to the handle the increased revenue that we saw in 2017 and 2018. So we've got to keep those projects going. We think they\u2019re critically important to our long-term future and we want to make sure we complete them, and move on to the next location where we know that we've got some capacity needs. And overall, we like to maintain about 25% excess capacity in the system and even with the seven openings that we had in 2018 and with the expectation of what we'll complete this year our excess capacity that is, is in about the 20% ballpark. So we want to make sure that we keep these - projects going and put ourselves in good shape from when we know the economy will pick back up. And certainly we believe that our service will continue to drive market share growth for us. Matthew Brooklier : And then we heard from some of the truckload carriers that the driver market actually has become a little bit less competitive. Curious to hear your thoughts I know it's not an apples-to-apples comparison, but LTL market drivers is the market gotten a little bit looser here. And if so, do you think that could be beneficial from a cost inflation perspective? Greg Gantt : We\u2019re certainly in good shape for drivers right now. We are not hiring other than maybe in a few selected locations, but we're really in good shape. Drivers right now, so we don't see that as an issue going forward. We are continuing to train some additional drivers, but at a slower pace than we did it last year, but we don't expect any issues from that standpoint at all. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from David Ross with Stifel. David Ross : Yes, good morning. Adam just a quick knit to start on the communications and utilities line item that was down year-over-year and if there is anything one-time in there what the run rate should be going forward? Adam Satterfield : Nothing material that's in there is any kind of adjustment. There is always some minor adjustments one way or the other that kind of run through there. As we may be moving into or out of one contract into another, but that expense remains relatively consistent quarter-to-quarter I think. David Ross : And so from here do you expect it to be about second quarter level for the rest of the year? Adam Satterfield : It was a little bit lower than where we were in the first. But so, it may step up a little bit more, you do have some cost that will continue to come on board as we're looking at [indiscernible] communication systems and switching over into a new platform. We've been working on that project this year, and that may have caused a little bit as we're kind of in the middle of transition a little bit of reduction there in the second quarter. But so it will probably be stepped up a little bit higher from an absolute\u2026 David Ross : Yes, that was my next question just for some more color on your AOBRD/ELD transition where does that stand. Are you going to have it done before the deadline, is it going better than expected? Greg Gantt : It's going good, David as any project major project like this you roll out there's always a few snap photos here and there. We're working through those, but it's going well. And we certainly expect to have it completed well before the deadline. David Ross : And does that change at all, how you run the network did the ELDs essentially do anything different from an Old Dominion perspective than the AOBR's did? Greg Gantt : No so, we\u2019ll have the same communications abilities that we had so no changes at all. Adam Satterfield : The big thing for us is, is working through and making sure we get all the telematics type of information and into or our own systems for evaluation tracking the hours is the easy part. It's all the data we get and what we do with it that we want to make sure that we're not missing out on. Greg Gantt : That's why you can't just plug them in and turn them on and go to work. It's a little more complicated than that, but we're working through it we've got a pretty aggressive team on that project and we're working through it David. Operator : And we currently have no questions in the queue at this time, I would like to turn it back to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Greg Gantt : Well, we certainly, thank you for all your participation today. We appreciate your questions and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks and I hope you have a great day. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.",

For this purpose, any statements made during this call that are not statements of historical fact, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words believes, anticipates, plans, expects, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. You are hereby cautioned that these statements may be affected by the important factors, among others, set forth in Old Dominion's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in this morning's news release and consequently, actual operations and results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. As a final note, before we begin, we welcome your questions today but ask, in fairness to all, that you limit yourself to just a couple of questions at a time before returning to the queue. We thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir. Greg Gantt : Good morning and welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Earl Congdon, our Senior Executive Chairman; Adam Satterfield, our CFO; and David Congdon, our Executive Chairman, who is joining from a separate location. Earl Congdon : Good morning, everyone. Greg Gantt : After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion delivered solid operating and financial results for the third quarter of 2019, in spite of the challenging environment. Decrease in our volumes reflects the continued softness in demand as some customer simply have fewer shipments than normal, while others may be placing more emphasis on price versus service, and choosing other carriers with lower rates. As a result, our LTL tons per day declined for the third straight quarter when compared to the prior year and quarterly revenue declined for the first time since the second quarter of 2016. Continuing decrease in volume that we have faced each quarter this year has resulted in the loss of operating density, yet we still improved the productivity of our operations and the ongoing improvement in yield help mitigate the impact to our bottom-line. We continue to believe that the path to long-term, profitable growth is the balance between operating density and yield management, both of which require the support of a favorable operating environment, along with improved productivity. I was pleased to see our P&D shipments per hour improved 1.6% in the third quarter, while and our dock shipments per hour increased 7%. Our line-haul latent load average decreased by 1.9%, but this metric was somewhat affected by the decrease in weight per shipment. While productivity is always a focus, it is imperative that we maintain our best-in-class service performance. Our team delivered on this front during the third quarter with on-time service of 99%, while our cargo claims ratio remained at 0.2%. This service performance is critical to support our ongoing focus on consistently improving yield, which provides us with the ability to further invest in our employees and our customers. We do this by investing in service center capacity and technology that supports customer demands, while also improving the efficiency of our operations. Our best investment, however, continues to be in our people. We rewarded the OD family with improvements to our wage and benefit program, which became effective in September, while continuing to provide the necessary tools and training for the team to better serve our customers. Our ability to provide customers with superior service and network capacity, balanced against our consistent cost-based approach to pricing, provides an unmatched value proposition that supports our ability to increase market share over the long term. Our value proposition was recently validated as Mastio & Company named OD as the Number One National LTL provider for the 10th straight year. In this latest survey, shippers ranked us number one in 33 of the 35 service and value-related attributes they measure. This was our best performance in terms of first place rankings for individual categories. A decade of award-winning service was made possible by our team of dedicated employees who are motivated to work hard every day to provide a superior level of service, which helps our customers keep their promises. The execution by our team and consistency in our long-term financial results, gives us continued confidence in our strategic plan. While we can't control the economy, we will continue to focus on the disciplined execution of this plan by providing superior service at a fair price, controlling costs, and investing for our future. Doing so will occasionally require decisions that may have a negative impact on short-term results, but support our long-term vision such as the ongoing investment in service center capacity. Our investment decisions are supported by our financial strength and the consistent returns we have generated during periods of both economic strength and weakness. We know from experience that the consistent execution of our strategic plan should help us win market share and thus create long-term profitable growth that will increase shareholder value. Thanks for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the third quarter of 2019 was $1.0 billion, which was a 0.9% decrease from the prior year. The third quarter of this year included one extra workday, so the decrease on a per-day basis was 2.5%. Our operating ratio increased to 79.3%. We were pleased to produce another sub-80 operating ratio in a challenging environment, especially considering some of the extra costs, included in our results. With the reduction in revenue and increased operating ratio, our earnings per diluted share decreased 3.3% to $2.05. Our revenue results for the quarter reflect the 5.2% reduction in LTL tons per day that was partially offset by the 4.4% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Excluding fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 5.8%, which was in line with our expectations, as LTL weight per shipment was more comparable to the third quarter of 2018. These yield results are consistent with our long-term, consistent approach to pricing. On a sequential basis, LTL tons per day and LTL shipments per day were both below normal seasonality. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, LTL tons per day decreased 1.2% as compared to the 10-year average increase of 1.9%, and LTL shipments per day were down 0.6% as compared to the 10-year average increase of 3%. At this point for October, our revenue per day is trending down 1.5% to 2%. LTL tons per day are slightly below normal seasonality, but I view this as a positive, considering our sequential performance over the past 15 months. This follows our August and September tonnage results that were both essentially in line with normal seasonality. The growth in our revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges for October, is trending lower than our growth rate in the third quarter. We expect a slight step down from the third quarter growth rate, due to tougher comparisons with the fourth quarter of 2018. Similar to the comments that we made on the second quarter call, we want to ensure that any slowdown in this growth rate is not misinterpreted as a change to our pricing philosophy. As usual, we will provide the actual revenue-related details for October in our third quarter Form 10-Q. Our third quarter operating ratio increased 90 basis points to 79.3%, as the increase in our overhead cost as a percent of revenue, unfortunately more than offset the improvement in our direct costs. Decrease in revenue had a deleveraging effect on many of our fixed overhead costs, as reflected in the 50 basis point increase in depreciation. In addition, our miscellaneous expenses increased 80 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2018. While several items within this account increased, the largest was a $4.9 million net loss on the disposal of property and equipment, as compared to a slight gain in the third quarter of 2018. Much of this loss was related to the removal of structural assets to create room for improved service center and maintenance facilities. In regard to our direct costs, we continue to gain productivity, and the year-over-year decrease in fuel prices has resulted in our operating supplies and expenses being lower as a percent of revenue. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $285.6 million and $747.5 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 respectively, while capital expenditures were $140.4 million and $370.3 million for the same periods. We continue to expect total capital expenditures of approximately $480 million for this year. We returned $54.2 million of capital to our shareholders during the third quarter and $246.4 million for the first nine months of the year. For the year-to-date period, this total consisted of $205.3 million of share repurchases, and $41 million in cash dividends. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter 2019 was 24.9%, as compared to 24.3% in the third quarter of 2018. We currently expect an effective tax rate of 25.8% for the fourth quarter this year, as the effective tax rate in the third quarter benefited from certain discrete tax adjustments. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins : Hey guys, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So Adam, I guess just going back to your prepared comments just around October and sort of what you're seeing there, I know you guys are going to give a more pinpoint number when the Q comes out. But would just be curious, if you or Greg could just talk about what you're seeing in terms of general business trends in October. It seems like things are kind of holding in there, even though the industrial data continues to be fairly challenging. I would just be curious to get your sort of broader take on how you're seeing macro trends thus far in October, and if things continue to feel relatively stable, all things considered? Adam Satterfield : Sure. This is Adam. We obviously see the same macroeconomic information that everyone else does, and have noted some of the industrial numbers that are now showing some weakness, but our trends are actually continuing to be stable. As I've mentioned, thus far with our October results and granted the month isn't it finished, but we're seeing, I would say more stability on the volume side than we have seen in recent quarters. What I mean by that is, going back to July of last year, the first month of every new quarter from a seasonality standpoint has been well below what our normal seasonal trends have been. And while we're below, we're roughly in line with the October results at this point. And that follows basically August and September that were in line with what our normal seasonality would be. That's been good to see, and obviously our yield trends are continuing to hold steady from a sequential standpoint as well. As we mentioned, we expect similar to what we did going into the third quarter that the growth rate in yield might slowdown a little bit in the fourth quarter, if you hold mix constant, and just even assuming a little bit of sequential acceleration from 3Q. That year-over-year change may be a little bit weaker, but we're seeing more stability and I think some of that is, we're starting to hear more business that we lost earlier in this year. Some of that business is coming back to us. They may have left this for a cheaper price, but maybe have become dissatisfied with the level of service they were receiving, so we're starting to win some of that business back and those have been good trends for us to see. Whereas maybe earlier in the year when the economic data was stronger and our results might have been a little bit weaker, now we're seeing some of the economic numbers showing weakness, while our results are staying fairly stable. It's been good to see. Jack Atkins : Okay. Well, that's very encouraging. I guess for my follow-up, just going back to your comments there Adam on pricing, and Greg's comments in his prepared remarks on yield. I mean, I guess how should we interpret the broader yield environment today relative to say, three months ago or six months ago? I know Greg said that, he's seeing shippers look for opportunities to sort of go after, in some cases, some lower prices in the marketplace. Are you seeing any more or less competition at the margin on yields? I just would be curious, if anything has changed there over the last several months? Adam Satterfield : I don't know that anything has necessarily changed. We were careful not to, and don't want to, try to characterize maybe the environment any more like we used to perhaps put a label on it. But certainly, we noted earlier this year kind of in late first quarter that competition intensified, and we dealt with that. And certainly it's had an impact on our volumes and that's what Greg's comments we\u2019re getting at. But that hasn't really changed at any point there forward. It continues to be competitive, and I think that just reflects the softness in demand that's out there. And it's not unusual in comparison to the periods that we've seen before. But certainly, the environment has been very supportive of our ability to continue to get the increases that we want. That's I think reflected in our numbers. We've been really pleased with that. And I think we've been really pleased to see our sales team, our pricing teams, working together, working with our customers, continuing to leverage the relationships that we have, figuring out how we can create win-win scenarios. I think that's reflective in our numbers as well. We're happy with the relationships that we have, but it takes people to leverage those relationships. Real people, not Gogo bots like Bumblebee Bee and Optimus Prime that can only do that in the movies. Jack Atkins : Well, that makes a lot of sense, Adam. Thanks very much for the time. Appreciate it. Operator : Question from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison Landry : Thanks, Adam. Good morning. So I just -- Adam, I wanted to go back to your comments about the stability in volumes in October and the last couple of months. I know you mentioned, you're regaining customers that maybe you lost earlier in the year. So when we think about these normal seasonal trends, would you attribute it more to sort of regaining this lost share? And perhaps it's not necessarily indicative of stability in sort of the broader environment? Maybe if you could give us a little bit of color on that? Adam Satterfield : I think that's more of it than anything, because certainly, you know, we're still seeing our revenue levels trending negative, which certainly we'd rather them be positive, and we're anticipating that coming into the year. But it's not necessarily anything to write home about at this point. And I think demand trends overall continue to be fairly weak, but certainly more of the reports that we've been getting recently have just been regaining some customer business that we've lost. But existing customers that have been by us all year, as Greg mentioned, they are continuing to see shipment levels that may not be where they were last year. So there has been a little weakness there. But overall, in recent months, I think that we're continuing to keep business with existing customers and then maybe winning back a little bit of business that perhaps had been lost earlier in the year. Allison Landry : Okay, that's helpful. And then on the salaries line, if I look at that as a percentage of sales and sort of the sequential trend is a little bit higher, I think, than sort of the normal historical trends would suggest. Was this mainly just driven by the deleveraging or are there any other factors that you would call out, that may have contributed to that? And then, any thoughts you can give us for how to think about Q4? Thank you. Adam Satterfield : For the salaries wages and benefits, when you pull those apart and you look at our productive labor trends, we saw some improvement there and I think that a lot of that was the productivity that we were able to gain during the quarter. When you look in sort of the overhead side, and then just thinking about the fringe benefits, we did have an increase related to our Phantom Share Program. So overall, fringes as a percent of salaries and wages in the third quarter this year were 36.6%. It was 35% in the third quarter of last year. So that drove some of the quarter-over-quarter increase, if you will, and that also was a reason for, from a sequential standpoint, why our costs were higher. The fringe benefit rate in the second quarter of this year was at 34.1%, which is in line with what I had estimated the year might be. So we were certainly a little bit higher there on that fringe benefit side, and increase, if you will, with the Phantom Share, which most people, I think, understand that program and the details of how that works. But with the share price of our stock that increased a little over $20 during the third quarter of this year created an entry of about $8.5 million, and we had Phantom expense in the third quarter of last year of about $2 million, so that was certainly a quarter-over-quarter headwind. But going into the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter typically includes several adjustments that could impact fringes. One of those is, every year we completed our annual actuarial study that includes the workers' compensation accruals and so that adjustment last year was pretty favorable. Then last year in the fourth quarter, we had a favorable entry related to our Phantom Share Program as well, so our fringe benefit cost as a percent of salaries and wages were 30.7% in that period. Right now, if our share price continues to hold, it's trending quite a bit above. I think we're about $20 or so above what the 50-day moving average at the end of the third quarter of this year was. So any sequential increase there in the share price would result in Phantom stock expense and then we'll just have to evaluate what those other adjustments might be. But absent any kind of adjustments one way or the other, I would expect our fringes to kind of be in that 34% range, if you will. So we just got, I mean the comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018, we had several favorable adjustments that benefited that operating ratio pretty significantly, I think, by about 200 basis points. Allison Landry : Okay. Just to clarify for the 34% fringe, that's a Q4 number, or is that a full year 2019 number? Adam Satterfield : That was my guesstimate for the full year, but absent any changes like I mentioned on the actuarial adjustment for workers' comp and for the Phantom Share Program, that's kind of the baseline of what I would expect in 4Q. Allison Landry : Okay. Adam Satterfield : Right now if we closed the quarter based on where the share price is, it would be much higher than that, because we'd have another big period of Phantom stock expense. Allison Landry : Right, Okay. Excellent. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. In the discussion on price, I guess the question is, when do you guys know if you are pushing too much on price? Or is there no such thing? Adam Satterfield : Ravi, I think that we certainly get feedback from our customers, and I think our pricing programs and our philosophy is always to look at the individual account profitability and then have a cost-based approach. When we talk with our customers every year and we look at what our cost inflation is, and then we work with our customers in the sense on what type of increase we might need, but then we also consider other ways that we can maybe accomplish the same objective of improving an operating ratio, if there are things that we can change operationally that maybe help us on the cost side for a specific customer. Those are just things that we work through, and then we work very hard to keep our cost structure as low as possible to drive operating efficiencies, so that basically the rates that we charge are in line with market rates, and maybe it's at a slight premium. But certainly when you think about the overall value equation, we think would provide a bit better value proposition than anyone, given the quality of service balanced against the consistency with our pricing approach. Ravi Shanker : Got it. And you implied that some of your old customers that you lost are coming back. Are you hearing from folks on the ground, are you getting a sense, or any more detail on why they're coming back? I mean, is this a service thing? Is this pricing? What's driving them back to you? Greg Gantt : Ravi, it's simply because our value proposition with our service product is superior. In some cases, they can't stand the service that they've been getting. Just the price isn't worth the service that they get, so they come back to us. Ravi Shanker : So, again -- sorry, go ahead. Greg Gantt : So we\u2019ve seen that very recently. I was actually in one of our service centers yesterday and had a few national account reps in attendance at this event we had. And I heard it again yesterday that we have business coming back, so that we lost because of price. So I think it's very positive from that standpoint. It's not massive business returning every day, but it's bits and pieces. They love what they had, they tried to go away for a cheaper price, and then they come back, so. It's been that way over the years, and again, we continue to rely on our value proposition. It's served us well over the years. Ravi Shanker : Got it. And that's a great segue to my next question. I mean is this something that normally happens in a down cycle? Can you use that as an indicator for where we might be in the cycle? Meaning, when you start to see the first few guys who left come back, does that imply some kind of inflection? Greg Gantt : I don't know if I can project that or not, but this does happen in a down cycle for sure. We've seen it happen over and over. It is consistent with what we've seen in the past. Ravi Shanker : Got it. Just a couple of housekeeping ones. One is, again, you guys probably sound more bearish on the cycle and industry trends than you've have -- and you\u2019ve done in many years, and you're still printing sub-80 ORs. Is it fair to say that outside of a recession this is like a floor on your OR right now? Adam Satterfield : I don't know that we want to make that call at this point and give any guidance on our operating ratio. But certainly, we've talked about our ability to continuously improve the operating ratio over the long term and it just takes continuous improvement density and consistency with our yield to offset our costs. And certainly we're lacking for density this year. We've faced some higher costs for multiple reasons, and some of those related to our fleet that we had planned for growth this year, and so we're probably a little heavy in that regard. So we're definitely carrying some higher cost, but that gives us opportunity as we work our way into next year, and then we'll just deal with the demand environment with whatever faces us. But certainly, we're always looking forward to kind of the next legs of growth, but we've got to operate and deal with whatever the economic situation is, but I think our strategic plan has guided us through downturns and upturns and we're certainly building out and investing in our service center footprint to ensure that we have capacity that's willing and ready to be able to step up when there is a positive inflection in the economy. It's just a matter of when that happens. Ravi Shanker : Got it. If I can just squeeze one more in, Adam, you said, you had a bunch of miscellaneous expenses in the quarter, including the $4.9 million you called out. Are those items all normalizing for 4Q? And what is the run rate number? Adam Satterfield : Our miscellaneous expenses tend to average around sort of 0.5% of revenue, and they are quite a bit above that, about 0.5 point related to that loss that we pointed out. But certainly that's not a repeating type of event, so those should go more back in line. I would expect them to in the fourth quarter. Ravi Shanker : Got it, thanks very much, guys. Operator : Question from Scott Group with Wolfe. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Morning, guys. Adam Satterfield : Morning, Scott. Scott Group : Adam, can you give us just the monthly numbers on tonnage and weight per shipment? And then with October revenue down 1% to 2%, just as you look at the balance of the quarter, can you help us think, do comps get tougher or easier as we think about modeling the full quarter? Adam Satterfield : Let me start with the tonnage. And you're talking about sequential or year-over-year changes? Scott Group : I'm good with year-over-year. Adam Satterfield : The year-over-year for tons in July, it was down 6%. In August it was down 5.2%, and then in September was down 4.5%. That's the tons per day. The shipments per day in July were down 5.3%, down 4.0% in August, and down 4.2% in September. In terms of the comps overall, our numbers when you go back and kind of look at the tons in particular, certainly the growth rate was when we started that number kind of going flatter in the fourth quarter of 2018, and some of that goes back to really the comps in September of 2017. So our comps then got significantly harder and that was that period where our revenue growth just stepped up tremendously from kind of that 12% to 19%, 19.5% rate in 3Q 2017 versus 4Q. So in that regard, the comps got harder in 4Q last year, and they get a little bit easier as we go into this year. So we'll just continue to watch and if we can somewhat get back to more consistent trends, even closer in line with normal seasonality, certainly, I mean if you start going into 2020, the comps will be maybe a little bit harder in the first half of that year, and then get a little bit easier as we progress through the year. Scott Group : Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate all the discussion on fringe earlier. If we look sequentially, labor costs were flat, and they typically increase. Total labor costs flat, and they typically grow 3% to 4%, I think, as you did the wage increase. Is headcount coming down sequentially? Is there anything going on with incentive accruals? I'm just trying to help understand why labor is flat? Adam Satterfield : It was up slightly, compared, if you're talking sequentially, to the second quarter, but there was a decrease in headcount, and that's something that we've talked a lot about, that we're always matching our labor revenue trends. That's a day-by-day, minute-by-minute kind of thing. But overall from a year-over-year standpoint, our peak number of employees was in October of last year, but we're down on average in the third quarter 3.7%. When you look at just September to September, I think the decrease is about 5%. So, and then sequentially in the third quarter, we were down from the second about 1.5%. We're just continuing to try to have the labor force right-sized based on the volumes that we're dealing with on a day-to-day basis, and I think that some attrition has taken place. We've just not filled or backfilled some of those positions, and just allowed the headcount to kind of drift down. And we'll continue to monitor that as we progress through the fourth quarter as well. Wouldn't necessarily expect any kind of material change, kind of flattish, if you will, from the third quarter going into the fourth quarter. Scott Group : Okay, helpful. And then just last thing, OR a little noisy this quarter. It was noisy fourth quarter last year. Anything you could do to just sort of help us think about OR seasonality sequentially year-over-year for fourth quarter? Adam Satterfield : Sure. I think that this quarter if you will and obviously, it's got a little bit of noise, maybe quite a bit of noise in it. But I think that if you sort of take out about half a point for that loss and maybe half a point on the benefits kind of side, so that would have been, just call it 78.3 for rounding, would have put us right in line with normal seasonality from the second quarter to third quarter and then maybe if you use that as a base going into 4Q. Normally the fourth quarter operating ratio was up a little over 200 basis points. Last year kind of skewed our averages down, but if you just sort of do a five-year average from 2017 going back, the average sequential increase was 240 basis points. So if you kind of roll that kind of adjusted third quarter number by an average, that's probably going to be more likely in line. Obviously, we're not giving that as guidance so to speak, but that will become kind of the baseline for which we would be comparing to. And obviously, we'll continue to watch and see sequentially how things go, the Phantom stock number is always, when our stock price is swinging around. It's good for us to see it increasing 20 bucks within a given quarter, but it ends up creating expense that might be higher than what would be in these longer-term averages. But that would -- for my comparison that would sort of be the baseline to compare and contrast against. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you, Adam. Operator : Go to our next question from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. Good morning everybody. Just I wanted to follow-up on the market share line of questioning, because, I guess the competitive landscape is also kind of evolving for the first time in a while. Saia is obviously expanding and seeing some early success there. XPO seems to be investing to make its LTL network more efficient or better utilized. So I'm just trying to understand if there is anything you're doing differently in that context of kind of an evolving competitive landscape. It just seems like you're ceding some market share, particularly in the Southeast. I'm not sure if you're doing anything different or how you think about going to market or engaging with the customers in that backdrop? Adam Satterfield : I think we continue to engage with our customers to sort of see what their demands are and how we can continue to respond to their changing needs. But at the end of the day, we look and evaluate the data that we have and customer perceptions on service. And the best means for us to do that is this very detailed data that we get from these MASTIO results. As Greg mentioned, we are really pleased to see that the perception for us has improved as compared to last year and we were number one in 33 of those 35 attributes, the best showing ever for us. So I think that as we continue to focus on doing right things, right for our customers, we're continuing to get feedback that they love our service in that regard and still perceive us as a very strong value. And maybe the invoice price for our service might be a little bit higher than the next person, but when you look at the total value equation, the cost of transportation can certainly be lower by using Old Dominion. So we can help our customers save money from a big picture standpoint, but also improve the service that they're delivering to their customers. Amit Mehrotra : Adam, is the spread between, just for our own edification, the spread between how far you guys are ahead versus the rest of the pack, has that changed at all or has that increased? Has it come in? I'm just trying to get a sense of kind of where you are relative to the pack now versus history? Adam Satterfield : It widened this year. Our lead widened and back to just the big picture market share, when we've gone through prior slower cycles, our market share kind of comes back more in line in terms of tonnage growth with where the market is, and that's some of what we've seen. But when we look at our market share by region, we've seen tremendous growth, given the environment in both the Northeast and the Midwest, and then we're just kind of flattish in most of the other regions. The Southeast, as you mentioned is just down slightly, but like we've seen in prior economic cycles, that's fairly short-lived and we think that we're continuing to hold our own and certainly we feel like doing the right things in terms of protecting our yield and most importantly protecting our service and continuing to invest in service center capacity. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up, just on the labor front, we've seen kind of this nice reduction in productive labor costs. It was like 27.5% in the first quarter, it was 27% last quarter. Can you just talk, I know you disclose it in the Q, but I wasn't sure if you can disclose where your productive labor costs were in the third quarter. What's the opportunity there? Like how low can that go in the context of maybe a little bit more of a difficult revenue environment? Adam Satterfield : It was 27.3%, the productive labor cost in the third quarter, so a slight improvement over where we were in the third quarter of last year. How low it goes, we don't know. We continue to look at how we can continue to leverage technology. I would say that we're already, this particular element of our cost, I think demonstrates the technology that we've invested in over the years and how efficient we operate, probably versus the industry. So that's something that we'll continue to look at how we can implement tools from whether it's a planning standpoint or any type of efficiency gain that we can make within our line-haul pickup and delivery or dock operations. We're thinking about this every day and certainly want to continue to drive efficiencies there where we can. But we're looking at ways that we can use technology to drive efficiency throughout all areas of operations, all of our back office functions as well, and then things that we can do that provide better information and better services to our customers that help on the yield side. Amit Mehrotra : Right. Okay, good. Congrats on the good results in a tough, tough environment. Thanks a lot. Bye. Operator : Go to our next question from Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Good morning, gentlemen. I want to talk a little bit about some of your end markets. In terms of the declines that you've seen, is there any difference between what we would look at as industrial versus consumer? And to that extent, was the quarter impacted negatively by the GM strike in anyway? Even though you might not have a lot of business with GM, you do parts business with some others. Adam Satterfield : The GM question, no, we didn't see or feel any kind of impact from that in any regard, other than maybe indirectly the fact that may be the economics of that particular region might be down a little bit, but nothing on a direct standpoint. In terms of the balance of our business, 55% to 60% of our revenue is industrial, and close to 30% is retail. And so this year, we have definitely felt, I think, that as industrial economy has had been slowing that's had an impact on our industrial related customers. And then on the retail side, that business had been the fastest growing for us, and kind of the change in revenue, if you will, at this point since its negative is more in line with both the industrial and the retailers. There\u2019s probably multiple reasons for that. Some of that I think we talked about, or have talked about before is that they may have been maybe a little bit more price conscious, and so that brought that growth rate down back more in line with the industrial in the first half of the year. But some of that is where we are winning business back. So, we\u2019d expect longer term to see our retail business probably continuing to grow faster than the industrial. Jason Seidl : Okay, that's very good color, Adam. I want to also jump back here for my second question, you mentioned about capital spending. I'm just trying to frame up, I know you don't give guidance for 2020, but just trying to frame it up, because you opened the call saying, hey, listen, we take a long-term approach to our spending, and look at our great track record, which you guys have a phenomenal one-off of investing in the right facilities and equipment and technology. So, I was just trying to think, how should we think just directionally about 2020 CapEx versus 2019, without giving any numbers, just directional thinking? Adam Satterfield : Well, I was going to give you the numbers, but since you didn't ask for them\u2026 Jason Seidl : Oh, perfect. No, hey, listen, you can always email that too. Adam Satterfield : We're in the process, actually, of trying to finalize what our CapEx plan will be for 2020. We go through a detailed process of building up a bottoms-up forecast and a top-down, and trying to figure out what we think the environment might look like from a top-line standpoint before we get into planning, primarily on the equipment side. But on the real estate front, we\u2019d certainly expect to continue our projects that we have in the works, and we always keep a two-year plan going, so that could be even higher next year. And we always keep our eyes out too from a longer term standpoint, things that may be on our long-term list, which we've got a target of about 40 service centers or so, or places that we think we need to add service centers. If the weakness in the market results in perhaps some service centers becoming available, they might be on, kind of, our three-year plan, but we would go ahead and take advantage of any opportunities that present themselves. We will keep our eye out there. And then on the equipment side, we just have to look at what the replacements are. And as I mentioned before, we're little heavy on the fleet side and generally when that happens, then you take less, probably, in the next fiscal year. So overall, my guess is that we'll probably have a little bit lower spend on equipment in 2020, but maybe higher on the real estate, and then we'll obviously keep our expenditures going from an IT standpoint as well. Jason Seidl : Perfect, that's great color. Listen, I appreciate the time as always. Greg Gantt : Jason, keep in mind that the majority of our CapEx spend from the real estate side will be in projects that we have already started that we are planning to complete. Jason Seidl : Right. Understood. Operator : Question from David Ross with Stifel. David Ross : Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Given your significant exposure to the 3PL world, I wanted to know if there\u2019s any significant changes this quarter, or into October, in terms of 3PL pricing and volume. And how, I guess, you see your 3PLs different from the other customers? Are there any different trends in the 3PL market? Greg Gantt : It seems like, if anything, our 3PL customers have trended. We are doing significant business with 3PLs. We've talked about that in the past, but if anything, at this point, they are trending on the positive side. David Ross : So they would be growing faster than the other basket of customers? Greg Gantt : That is correct. David Ross : Excellent. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Fowler : Hi, great. Thanks and good morning. I know that we see the reported yield numbers, but obviously there is some mix and some things that could impact that. I was wondering if you could share maybe some comments on where you think contract renewals are on a base, kind of, basis for maybe just the industry, and how that's been trending this year? Has the rate of increase been pretty consistent? Are you seeing any moderation in the contract pricing? Adam Satterfield : Sure, Todd. Well, one, we kind of stopped giving any kind of numbers and details on contract renewals, because it somewhat felt like, especially what we hear other companies say, they don't always reconcile to what the actual yield numbers are. But what we've been able to get this year on the contract renewals, more so you can see it in the third quarter where you don't have the same type of mix effect, if you will, with the weight per shipment. It was still down a little bit, given a little bit of a boost, but kind of more in line. When we look more at our revenue per shipment, if you will, and kind of how that's trending, that really gets at the heart of what we're trying to do in the long-term. Our revenue per shipment growth has been kind of in the 4.5% to 5% range and that's been kind of 80 to 100 basis points higher than what our cost inflation has been on a per-shipment basis. I'd say that last year we probably made a little bit more headway, obviously in 2017 and in 2018, in that regard. This year we didn't have the same type of expectations, but probably not getting that full kind of delta above cost inflation, which was the shipment weakness. Our cost per shipment has been a little bit higher than what I had anticipated as well. It's always a balancing act, but our target, when it comes to contract renewals and our GRI is -- our assumptions on what our cost per shipment will be trending and we came into the year expecting about a 4.5% increase in that regard. And so, we target an increase above that, and I'd say that our renewals have certainly been on the positive side of that cost inflation target. Todd Fowler : Okay. So, if I hear you correctly, Adam, I mean the contract renewals remain pretty consistent and kind of within your targeted range and maybe it's not unusual or not unfair to think about kind of slightly below mid-single-digits right now? Adam Satterfield : Yeah, that's fair to say and they've been pretty -- the renewals that we've got have been consistent all year long, really. Todd Fowler : Great, okay. And then just to follow-up, the year-over-year decline in weight per shipment moderated in the third quarter and I think the numbers that you gave to an earlier caller's question about the trend, it feels like in September the gap really closed. When you look at weight per shipment, what do you read into that metric? As you think about that going forward, if that stabilizes and turns positive, how does that impact the results or what can that mean from a margin perspective? Adam Satterfield : The lower weight per shipment has produced lower revenue per shipment as well, and so your cost to handle is going to essentially be the same in terms of you are continuing to make those same pickups and deliveries, the same number of stops and the dock handling cost is going to be the same. That certainly eats into the operating income on a per-shipment basis. But the weight per shipment trend that we've seen, it's really been down in levels, in that sort of 1,550 pound-ish range; we were slightly below that during the quarter. But that was fairly consistent with what we saw in late 2015 and through 2016 as well, when the industrial economy was a little bit weaker. So, I think it reflects the fact that the industrial economy has been softer and maybe a little bit higher mix to retail business, going back to that timeframe. But we were pleased to see we had seen a little bit of a drop in the weight per shipment in August, and kind of thought that it had dropped to about 1,530 pounds and I felt like that was continuing to show the economy or to reflect in the weakness in the economy, but that came back pretty solid in September to 1,554 pounds. So, I was really pleased to see that September number sort of come back up and help us there in that regard. Todd Fowler : Okay. Thanks for the time and nice job getting that Transformers reference in earlier. Adam Satterfield : Thanks Todd. I'm glad you got it. Operator : Our next question is from Matt Brooklier with Buckingham Research. Matt Brooklier : Hey, thanks and good morning. I'll be quick. Adam did you talk to the magnitude of wage increase that was put into place in third quarter? Adam Satterfield : I don't think I said it, but it was about 3% this year in terms of the wage and we continue to do some other things on the benefit side that add extra cost as well. So, it's one of those things we continue to look at the program as a whole and between the different generations of employees we have, there's some value, kind of your paid time off and the other incremental benefits that we offer, whereas some may put more emphasis on the wage. But you've got to have a healthy balance between both. And I think we achieved that this year with the changes that we made to both wages and benefits. Matt Brooklier : Okay. And that 3% compares to -- what was it last year? Adam Satterfield : About 3.5% last year. Matt Brooklier : Got it. And then can you talk to your service center count, your expectations for opening more locations through the end of the year. I think the message last quarter was, you were looking to accelerate the rate of terminal openings this year. I just wanted to check in to see if that's still the plan here? Greg Gantt : Yes Matt. We have -- today, we have 236 and we have half a dozen or so that are in process now. Several of those we will get opened prior to the end of the year and then several more that we will look at opening first quarter next year. Matt Brooklier : Okay. And then just last one quickly, you talked to incurring a loss on the disposal of some of the property to make way for either a new maintenance facility or you're expanding a maintenance facility. Maybe just give us a little bit more color in terms of, is that one location, is that multiple locations? Are you doing something different in the network with respect to your maintenance? Are you expecting to do more maintenance in house? Or is this just kind of a one-time thing where you just needed more capacity at a certain location? Thank you. Greg Gantt : It was absolutely a one-time occurrence, Matt. We acquired some additional property in a location and we built a new maintenance facility on that property that we acquired, and took the other one out that was actually in the way and restricted us quite a bit from an operating standpoint, from a yard space standpoint, so that's why we did it. Operator : Our next question from Ariel Rosa with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ariel Rosa : Hey, good morning, guys. For my first question, I just wanted to touch on your thoughts on how this current downturn compares to the severity of previous downturns that you've seen in your career? A number of carriers mentioned that they think conditions might start to improve somewhere around second half 2020. I would love to get your thoughts on just kind of where we are in the cycle, and what your thoughts are on when we might start to see some improvement? Greg Gantt : That's hard for us to call, because I'm not an economist and I don't play one on TV, but we continue to look at those economic reports and have conversations with our customers to try to figure out what demand trends might be. And certainly, comps will get a lot easier in the second half of next year. But I think going through the first part of the year, you've still got a little bit, probably, of an overhang from a political risk standpoint and what that landscape might be as we work our way into this election cycle, and what effect that's had. Fortunately, the consumers continue to be strong, and the consumer drives 70% of the economy. So if business owners can maybe have a little confidence in terms of what the landscape might be from a tax and regulatory standpoint, then maybe they'll take the lid off of spending a little bit more and we can get the economy growing at a healthier rate like we had seen. But we'd certainly like to think that it might be stronger in the second half of the year, and have read reports to suggest as much. We certainly will be in position and ready if that happens. And I think we've proven in the past that we can certainly rise to the challenge if demand trends change and incremental volumes come our way at a more rapid pace than certainly what we've been seeing recently. Ariel Rosa : Great, that's helpful. And, Adam, you mentioned retail a bit earlier, your retail exposure. Could you talk about what activity levels you're seeing in preparation for the holiday season, and maybe how that compares to previous years? Adam Satterfield : We don't see a whole lot of impact anymore from the holidays. It's minimal, at best. I think most of the retailers and whatnot; they're so far out in front of it now compared to what they used to be. We just don't see a huge impact from that either way. Ariel Rosa : Okay. Fair enough. And then just my last question. So I think your most recent GRI was in May, and I think it was close to 5%. Just assuming that activity levels kind of stay where they are, do you think that's an achievable level for next year? Or, do you think it would have to moderate a bit to maintain the market share that you guys are targeting? Greg Gantt : I think as we get closer to that point in time, we will certainly evaluate where we are with the market and whatnot, but probably a little bit too early to make those decisions. Ariel Rosa : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for the time. Operator : Question from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Chris Wetherbee : Yes. Hey, thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. I guess, I wanted to come back to the tonnage comments, and I guess the revenue per day implies, if you make an assumption about where you think yields might be, down a little bit from 3Q, it implies a step backwards in tonnage in October, at least, and I guess against easier comps. I guess maybe the first question is, just wanted to get a sense maybe of what you're seeing in the market. I know it's sort of weaker than seasonal, but what are the dynamics that you may be seeing admittedly early here in 4Q? And do you think that 4Q total tonnage, based on what you're seeing from your customers in the end market, could be down as much or maybe a little lower than where the decline was in the third quarter? Adam Satterfield : Without giving any specific guidance on anything, certainly we mentioned the comps get a little bit easier in the fourth quarter for us, so we'll continue to just sort of see how things come in. But, obviously, we'd love to see the improvement, and the fact now that if you kind of piece the last three months together and include October, and if kind of what our current trends are at this point, if they can kind of hold, we'll have sort of the first three months trend following normal seasonal patterns in quite some time, going back into 2018 when things were growing so nicely for us. So we'll continue to monitor that, but I think that when you just sort of look overall, like I mentioned, the revenue on a per-day basis in October at this point down kind of 1.5% to 2%, and not that it's a marked improvement, but it is slightly better than the 2.5% per day decrease that we had in the third quarter. So we'll continue to monitor those trends, and hopefully we'll continue to see some business coming back to us from a customer standpoint. And it'd be nice to see if these trends can continue to hold somewhat in line with normal seasonality that might allow us eventually in 2020 to maybe get back into more of a growth environment, versus dealing with the declines that we faced this year. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. No, that's helpful to understand. And then Just maybe separately, when you think about 2020 and kind of the current environment that we're in, obviously sluggish from a demand perspective, can you just give us a sense of sort of how you're approaching what you've talked about before in terms of your bigger picture capacity growth aspirations? I think you've talked about a good opportunity to continue to grow and take share. Do you start 2020, a little bit on pause in that respect, or do you kind of continue just sort of along? It sounds like you want to be opportunistic in case opportunities or assets come available, but I just want to get a sense of maybe how we think about sort of that approach as you are entering 2020? Adam Satterfield : We always look at sort of the three big buckets of capacity, and the biggest component being the real estate needs. An LTL network requires a certain amount of doors to be able to process freight, otherwise growth can be limited. So that's something and it's an investment that can't be made overnight, it takes a long time to plan and to ensure that we stay ahead of the growth curve in that front. So I think that the investments that we've made and the plan that we've had over the last couple of years, we're probably from an excess capacity standpoint within the service center network, we're somewhere around kind of 20% excess capacity, and we'd like to be closer to 25%. The growth in 2017 and 2018 kind of ate into that spare capacity somewhat, so we're still trying to make progress toward getting that number up maybe a little bit higher, so we do have it in place for when that next big leg of growth comes our way. And then, from a people standpoint, we're always looking at continuing to train our people, our drivers, and I think some of the changes that we've made this year when we haven't had the demand to dictate, we've had some pools of drivers that have moved to the dock. And so they are is still in place and ready for, again, when demand picks up and the full-time need is there, to fill in on that need. And then the final piece would be on the equipment side, and that's something that certainly we manage more on the year-to-year basis. When we get a better feel for what our bottoms-up type of projections might be for next year that will be when we really finalize and fine tune what we think the equipment needs will be for 2020. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Okay. That's super helpful. Last question very quick detail, you had mentioned 34% on the fringe as sort of as good a guess as you can give for 4Q, but with the stock where it is, all things equal, it would be higher because of Phantom stock? I just want to make sure that's what you're saying about the fourth quarter, specifically? Adam Satterfield : Yeah, that's exactly right. That 34% is kind of a good baseline, if you will, and that's closer to what we had in the second quarter of this year. Which, the second quarter of this year included about $1 million of Phantom stock expense, so there are a lot of kind of puts and takes in that number on the fringe line with paid time off benefits and workers' comp and other items. But nevertheless, there's probably just been a little bit more fluctuation and variability in that Phantom Share Program this year than perhaps we've seen before. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much for the time. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kevin Sterling with Seaport Global Securities. Kevin Sterling : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen and thanks for squeezing me in. Just kind of a real big picture question, you talked about business coming back to you because of service, and they may have left because of a lower price. From a historical perspective, and this is not your first rodeo, when you see business leave but it comes back to you, because maybe they were getting poor service from another carrier, does that business tend to be a little bit more sticky going forward? The customer realizing, well, I'm not going to make this mistake again. How should we think about that with this business coming back to you? Does it tend to be a little bit more sticky. Have you seen that over time? Greg Gantt : We would certainly hope so, for sure. No doubt, I think we have customers that maybe got burnt once and they don't want to get burnt twice. So yes, we have seen that. You know, in some cases situations at the various customers will change. They may get new management or what not, and who knows what you face the next year. But yes, for the most part, it does become more sticky for sure. Kevin Sterling : Got you. Thank you. And Adam, I know your tax rate moved around a little bit this quarter. I think you're guiding to 25.8% for the fourth quarter. For 2020, should we think about in that 26% range for a tax rate for 2020? Is that a fair assumption? Adam Satterfield : I think that's probably a good benchmark to use, yes. Kevin Sterling : Okay. Well, that's all I had today. Thanks so much for your time and color today. Adam Satterfield : Thanks. Operator : Our last question from Ben Hartford with Baird. Ben Hartford : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Adam, just to finalize a thought on weight per shipment. It was running 1,530 pounds earlier in the quarter. At 1,545 it is as low, really, as it has been in a decade, as low as it was in 3Q 2015. I know the efforts that you took last year to kind of protect the network. We know trends have been weak from an industrial end market perspective, and truckload capacity has been loose, but this level here, what's your level of confidence that we're at or near a trough? Or, is there any sort of mix change within the network that could drag that number lower from here? What are your thoughts there? Adam Satterfield : Probably a little bit of mix change, just the fact that we have a little bit more retail exposure and I think those shipments tend to be a little bit lighter weighted. But like I mentioned before, it was really good and a positive for me to see that dip that we had in August, kind of the rebound that we had back in September, and things sort of coming back sequentially, if you will, in that jump back up to slightly above 1,550. But I think that, we're just kind of down in this lower sort of range and there's fewer demand for widgets right now. And so fewer widgets on each shipment that we're handling and I think that's just a reflection of kind of the environment, very similar to that late 2015 and 2016 period as well. So we earlier in the year, we did have the operational change headwind, if you will, and that was the cause for the 4%-ish type of year-over-year decrease in weight per shipment. And so now we should be -- from a mix standpoint, more in line with and more comparable type of numbers, if you will, in that regard. I think it's just somewhat a sign of -- the slight decrease was a sign of just continuing to be in a little bit weaker operating environment. Ben Hartford : And I guess in that vein, some competitors have announced across the threshold services recently, residential delivery. Any change in your viewpoint as it relates to the potential for across the threshold or residential-type deliveries within your network? Adam Satterfield : Not from our regard. That's not something that we're focused on at this point. We feel like there are better market opportunities out there, and we'll continue to focus on serving the needs. The LTL needs of our customers and not necessarily trying to get into more residential types of deliveries. Ben Hartford : Thank you. Operator : At this time, I will turn the call back to Mr. Congdon for any additional or closing remarks. Earl Congdon : Okay, this is Earl Congdon. Thank you all for your participation today. But before we close the call, I would like to also share my appreciation with the entire Old Dominion family. I am extremely proud of our recent MASTIO award, as well as our financial accomplishments this year. I think that keeping our operating ratio below 80, in spite of a reduction in revenue, was quite an accomplishment. One of our largest shareholders, the Congdon family certainly wants to see the company's profitable growth to continue, and we know that we have the team in place that will make that happen. We appreciate your questions today and feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and have a good day. Operator : Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.",

The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. As a final note, before we begin, we welcome your questions today but ask, in fairness to all, that you limit yourself to just a couple of questions at a time before returning to the queue. Thank you for your cooperation. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead sir. Greg Gantt : Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. For the fourth quarter, our results reflect another period with a slight reduction in revenue that was due in large part to the service domestic economy. Despite these economic conditions, we maintained our relentless focus on revenue quality and cost controls and are pleased with our consistent financial performance. While our diluted earnings per share decreased as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, the decrease in our pretax income was primarily due to a $30.7 million increase in fringe benefit cost that was partially driven by changes to our Phantom Stock Plan. Adam will address the Phantom Stock Plan expense in more detail, but the amendments to these plans in December 2019 should prevent fluctuations in our share price from materially impacting our earnings in future periods. The overall operating environment in the fourth quarter felt similar to what we experienced for most of 2019. We won't again continue with the decrease in LTL terms although we were pleased to see our volumes perform in line with normal seasonality when compared to the third quarter of 2019. This was the first time this year that we were in line with our normal seasonal trend. We are encouraged by this volume trend as well as economic forecast for the industrial economy to improve in -- during 2020, although we are cognizant of increased political risk associated with an election year. Regardless of the economic or political environment, we will continue to focus on managing the things that we can control. This starts with our steadfast commitment to delivering superior service at a fair price while also diligently controlling our cost. Our on-time performance was 99% and our cargo claims ratio was 0.2% for the fourth quarter. Providing this level of superior service in periods with reduced operating density generally results in the loss of productivity and increased operating cost. We operate with great efficiency in the fourth quarter. However, and improve both our P&D shipments per hour and platform shipments per hour by 1.1% and 4.2% respectively. We have said many times before that long-term improvement in our operating ratio is dependent upon consistent improvements in density and yield both of which require the support of a positive macroeconomic environment. While we didn't get a lot of help from the economy and our volumes were lower than expected for 2019, we improved our yields by maintaining a consistent cost-based approach to pricing supported by our superior service. Long-term improvement in our yields has allowed us to make significant investments over the years to support our market share goals. Despite the softer volumes in 2019, our capital expenditures totaled $479 million and we maintained our commitment to the ongoing expansion of our service center network. Although, we only increased our operating service center count by one in 2019, we finished the construction of several other facilities that did not officially open them to avoid the increased operating cost. We intend to open six to eight service centers in 2020 including the ones that have already been completed and believe that adding door capacity to our network should ensure that it will not be a limiting factor to our growth. While 2019 was not the year that we expected it to be, our team is proud of our financial results. We finished the year with company records for annual revenue and diluted earnings per share. If it were not for the phantom stock plan expense associated with the 53.7% increase in our share price, we would have also improved our operating ratio. So I would like to thank our Old Dominion family of employees for their solid execution that produced these results in a challenging environment. As we look forward to 2020, we will continue to focus on managing the fundamental aspects of our business, and adhere to the same business model that has served us well through many economic cycles. We firmly believe that, if we can continue to execute on this plan, we can deliver even greater value for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us this morning. And now Adam will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $1.0 billion, which was a 1.7% decrease from the prior year. Revenue for the year increased 1.6% to a new company record of $4.1 billion. For the fourth quarter, our earnings per diluted share decreased 7.7% to $1.80, due to the combination of the decrease in revenue and 260 basis point increase in our operating ratio. Earnings per diluted share for the year increased 3.8% to $7.66, which was also a company record. Our revenue results for the quarter reflect the 4.5% reduction in LTL tons that was partially offset by the 2.7% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Excluding fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 4%, which was in line with our expectations. On a sequential basis, LTL tons per day decreased 1.6% as compared to the third quarter, which is in line with normal seasonality. LTL shipments per day were down 3.8% on a sequential basis, which was just slightly below the 10-year average decrease of 3.3%. For January, our revenue per day increased 0.2% as compared to January of 2019. Revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges, increased 4.1% to offset the 3.6% decrease in LTL tons per day. The increases in our fourth quarter and annual operating ratio are both attributable to increases in our fringe benefit cost for the periods compared. For the fourth quarter, our fringe benefit cost increased to 39.7% of salaries and wages from 30.7% in the fourth quarter of 2018, due primarily to changes in phantom stock expense. The fourth quarter of 2018 included an $8.4 million reduction in expense that was due to the decrease in our share price for that period. This compares to $17.1 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2019 that resulted from the previously disclosed amendments to these plans as well as the increase in our share price during this quarter. All of our other combined cost improved as a percent of revenue for the quarter. We were able to offset the increases in insurance and depreciation with improvements in operating supplies and expenses and salaries and wages. Our team did a nice job of matching labor to current revenue trends, while also improving productivity. Our average headcount was down 5.6% as compared to the 4.1% decrease in LTL shipments. We currently believe that our workforce is appropriately sized for current shipment trends and our fleet is in good shape as well. As shipment levels begin to improve, however, we will likely need to add to our workforce this year. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $236.4 million for the fourth quarter and $983.9 million for the year, while capital expenditures were $109 million and $479.3 million for the same respective periods. We returned $49.2 million of capital to our shareholders during the fourth quarter and $295.5 million for the year. For 2019, this total consisted of $241 million in share repurchases and $54.6 million in cash dividends. We were pleased that our Board of Directors approved a 35.3% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share commencing in the first quarter of 2020. This action reflects the Board's confidence in our prospects for continued growth and affirms our commitment of returning capital to our shareholders. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 24% as compared to 26.6% in the fourth quarter of 2018. For the year, our effective tax rate was 25.3%. We currently expect an effective tax rate of 25.5% for 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Question-and: Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins : Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Adam Satterfield : Good morning, Jack. Jack Atkins : So Adam, if I could just go back to your comments around January. And Greg, I'd love to get your thoughts on this, as well. But, I appreciate the added color there, on the first month of the quarter. If you could just sort of expand a bit about sort of how the market is feeling to you guys to the first call it, four or five weeks of the year? Obviously, we got a little bit better-than-expected PMI print, earlier this week. And then, -- but we have some offsets there with this production halted Boeing and some of these things happening with global trade. So, would just be curious to get your take on the market how it feels today? And are you continuing to see stabilization in your view relative to normal seasonality? Greg Gantt : Thanks, Jack. It does seem to be stabilizing. And the commentary from our customers and the communications that I've had with them, for the most part seem to be positive. So, we're positive on where we are. And what we look like going forward. So, let's hope that it does improve the rest of the year. Jack Atkins : Okay. That's great. That's great to hear. And then, I guess on the cost side for a moment, Adam, could you kind of help us think through the puts and takes, when we think about the sequential progression of OR. I know there are a lot of moving pieces in the fourth quarter. And I guess from a bigger picture perspective, how are you guys thinking about, cost inflation on a per shipment basis, in 2020? Adam Satterfield : Sure. Obviously, the biggest item that we dealt with in the fourth quarter and called out was the -- that adjustment for the phantom stock expense. So that was a big headwind if you will. And especially when you consider that fourth quarter of 2018 rather, included so many credits that kind of went the opposite way. And we had talked last year about how those help the operating ratio, probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 150 basis points to 200 basis points last year. So I think that, we've got that that was in our fringe benefits line. There are probably a couple of other things that stand out in this quarter, that were a little unusual. Obviously, the insurance line for one is probably the easiest one to see. We had -- we go through our annual actuarial assessment. And usually make those adjustments in the fourth quarter. So that ticked up to 1.8% of revenue, typically averages around 1.1%, 1.2%, throughout the year. And that's our cargo claims ratio which is 0.2%. And then typically the balance is our auto exposure. But we had an unfavorable adjustment related to our annual actuarial assessment there. What you don't see is there are some credits that kind of offset that unfavorable, that are in some of the other lines. Some of those are in the fringe benefit line we had a favorable adjustment related to the same actuarial assessment on our workers' comp liabilities, some other credits that are in the, operating supplies and expenses line. So all those other things nothing material to call out, one way or the other individually, but kind of had just some puts and takes in those other lines that would most likely normalize, as we progress into the first quarter of next year. Jack Atkins : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much for the time. Adam Satterfield : Thanks, Jack. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks good morning. I wanted to see if you could elaborate a little bit on the tonnage trends that you saw through the quarter? I apologize if you did go through that I might have missed it. But particularly December it looks like it improved a little bit. And I know you like to wait until the Q comes out or the K, I guess in this case to give us sort of the current month. But any sort of thoughts, just directionally on how things are trending here early in 1Q? Adam Satterfield : Yeah. Well for the fourth quarter to start with that, we were pleased to see that overall for the quarter, we were in line with what our normal sequential trends typically are. And we did that both on the tonnage side. And just revenue in general, kind of performed as the 10-year average I guess has performed. So that was good to see. And it's really the first time that that's happened this year. And really goes back into last year, in the back half we started seeing a little bit of unfavorable trend as well. So that was good to see. As we transitioned into January, we gave the number. But the year-over-year January the tons were down 3.6%, revenue flat. So that was we're starting to see the progression, where we were -- the revenue was down about 2.5% in the third quarter, on a per day basis, down a little bit less in the fourth quarter on a per day basis. And now it's flattish. But we're on the good side of flat, being just slightly positive, so, all kind of good trends, to see developing. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate that. And then when I think about the phantom stock, if you were to think about the entire year and what that means as we sort of transition into 2020? In terms of the tailwind, I guess there'll be a tailwind to growth potentially from the cost that you incurred in 2019 that won't be recurring. But can you sort of just sum it up just so we know what the total number is, for the full year when we look at that clean going into 2020? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I think we talked about that in the prepared remarks, but the volatility that we've had with that program. It kind of went up and down as we progress through this year. And frankly, it's been doing that and trending along as we've progressed through the last couple of years as our share price has increased and it's always nice to be able to go back and say just like Greg did, that our share price increased 50% or over 50% this year. But that -- the way the accounting was on that program, it resulted in expense. So in total we had about $35 million of phantom stock expense in 2019 and that compared to -- when you go back to 2018, we only had about $6 million. So a big overall headwind, if you will, but that number went into the overall fringe benefit line. I think that we'll see a little bit of improvement there for this year. But I'm still looking at overall -- that total probably being somewhere in the neighborhood of 34% of salaries and wages as we progress into 2019. We won't have we were north of that 34% bogey for 2019 because of that phantom stock expense, but we'll still face some cost inflation related to our health programs, pharmacy costs continue to increase. So I think that we'll see that increased rate of inflation on that program as well as some of the other costs that go into those fringe benefit lines. Greg Gantt : And Chris it is behind that. That's behind us for sure. Chris Wetherbee : Yes. It's a high-class problem to have, but definitely enough to spot in the rearview. Thanks very much for the time. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll go next to Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Adam just helping us with what productive labor costs were in the quarter as a percentage of revenue? And then I know you talked about headcount going up or just trending up the shipment increase and that obviously makes sense. But if you could just help us think about the increase in headcount relative to shipment growth? Is it kind of proportional, if you see 2% 3% increase in shipment growth, that's kind of what we should expect on headcount? I think that would just be helpful. And then last very specific question is, D&A took a big step-up in 2019. And I just want to know what the right way to think about it in 2020? Adam Satterfield : All right. I'll try to see if I can remember all those questions. Amit Mehrotra : That was one question by the way. There were just three parts. Yes. Adam Satterfield : Three questions in one. I don't want to -- I guess, but anyways the productive labor costs were pretty flat in the fourth quarter compared to last year, 27.9% for both of the periods compared. But that's actually a good thing. We look at all of our direct operating costs combined. And when you've got a period where fuel prices are fluctuating and our fuel costs were down, the average price were down -- was down a little over 6% in 4Q of 2019 versus 2018. So typically that impacts obviously your fuel surcharge revenue as well as fuel expenses. So you see revenue going down -- your operating supplies and expenses going down as a result of the drop in fuel price, but typically the labor would go up slightly as a percent of revenue. So I think we've got that benefit. And overall in the salary wages and benefits line, I think that you can kind of see that trend sort of playing out. One of the things that -- a couple of things that sort of benefit that line performance-based compensation was lower for the fourth quarter this year and that frankly just relates to the fact that revenue was down and the operating ratio was lower. Those are kind of two ingredients that go into most of our bonus programs. Our headcount in the fourth quarter, it was down versus the third quarter. Typically, you've got an increase -- a sequential increase if you will from the third into the fourth. And so, like we said in the prepared comments typically first quarter headcount on average is kind of flattish with the fourth quarter and I think that where we see trends right now that we're in pretty good shape on the headcount. Obviously these trends continue to play out. If we can see our volumes start to grow then likely that would mean that we would be adding to our headcount later in the year. And that would be a good thing actually. We hope that we're in that position with the workforce, but the fleet we kind of addressed that in prepared comments as well. I think that we're in good shape. We made orders last year anticipating kind of mid single digit growth. And on the volume side and we ended up with mid-single-digit decrease in tons. So we're probably a little bit heavy and there's a lot of carrying costs both in the depreciation line, as well as the maintenance and repair cost on that heavier fleet. So those are things that hopefully will grow into the fleet that we have as we progress through 2020. Amit Mehrotra : Yes. So D&A more flattish in 2020, I guess it depends on when the revenue equipment came in, but, I guess, more flattish in 2020? Adam Satterfield : Well, we've still got a decent-sized CapEx program, not as much on the equipment side, but it's still $315 million. Some of that will be technology, which has a shorter depreciation period. So you get hit with a little bit more of that. Longer term, I think, when you look at kind of the change in average or the annual depreciation rate, rather, it's somewhere in kind of the 5 percentage range of the overall CapEx budget for the year. But since we've got a continuation of the real estate and the real estate making up the majority of the CapEx plan, then it certainly should be lower than that. But we'd certainly expect it to be increasing, as we progress through the year and continue to execute on that CapEx plan. Amit Mehrotra : Right. And then, the share count -- last question for me, the share count. Is that -- so the way the phantom thing works? I guess, now the variability of stock price will have no impact on the fringe benefit cost and you're just going to add it a little bit to the share count? Is it like a 357,000 increase in the share count, is that simply how it works? Adam Satterfield : Yes. The diluted shares will reflect that, that will go into that diluted share count, if you will, those shares that are outstanding and we'll give that detail too that should be in our 10-K filing, but you can kind of go back and look at last year's 10-K as well and see kind of the outstanding shares that were there. Not a lot of impact to the fourth quarter, given the timing of when that program or when we made that change, if you will. But certainly, that will impact diluted shares going forward. Amit Mehrotra : Got it. Okay. Very good. Thank you for taking my questions. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll go next to Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Could you guys touch a little bit on, sort of, LTL pricing? It feels like it's still pretty stable out there in the marketplace and sort of how shippers are communicating to you, what to expect for 2020? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I think that it's been stable and, certainly, it was pretty much in line with what we thought it would be in the fourth quarter. And, I think, what we talked about on the third quarter call for how that trend would play out. So we continue to go through our bid process and continue to -- had wins, but obviously with revenue down and the back half of last year, I guess, there were more losses than wins, overall, if you will. So as we transition into this year, I think, that you've seen some of our competitors' yield numbers compress as they went through the back half of last year and that was just probably as their own bid situations kind of went through. And, I think, we talked after the first quarter call that we started seeing a little bit of competitive response in kind of the March-April time frame of last year. And that pretty much played out. And I think it played out in the competitive yield numbers that were disclosed for the public carriers as well. So we would expect to continue to try to get our cost-based pricing and continue to execute on this type of consistent approach that we've had year in and year out. And so, I think, Jack asked earlier about our cost inflation projections, kind of, underlying costs for this year, probably somewhere around 4% on a per shipment basis and that becomes the baseline for the conversations that we have with our contractual customers and go -- will go into our thinking when we get to the point of announcing a GRI for our tariff-based business as well. Jason Seidl : Okay. That's great color. And the other thing, any reaction from any of your customers? Adam Satterfield : Can you repeat that? Jason Seidl : No, no. Yes. No. Any reactions from your customers about the impacts of the coronavirus at all on their supply chains? Just trying to think out how first quarter might work out? Greg Gantt : Jason, not to my knowledge. We haven't heard anything negative related to that so far, thankfully. Jason Seidl : Okay. It's me knocking on wood. Gentlemen, thank you for your time. Greg Gantt : Okay. Operator : We'll go next to Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Just want to follow-up on the insurance comments and thanks for the color in your prepared remarks. I'm really surprised that you guys have such a low historical claims ratio. And, obviously, our such amazing operators are seeing a spike in insurance rates. I mean, if it's this bad for you, what's it like for the rest of the industry? And, I think, you said you had some kind of actuarial hit? Was there a particular incident that drove that? I mean, any color there would be helpful. Adam Satterfield : Yeah. Not necessarily one particular accident that drove the hit in the fourth quarter. We go through an annual process where the actuaries look at all open claims going back for all the years. And some years, you have positive development, in some years you have unfavorable development. When you go back to last year in the fourth quarter, we did have a positive adjustment in that period. I think our expenses were 0.9% of revenue, where it did trend at 1.1%, 1.2% or so for the first three quarters of the year. So this year was just several claims that are still open that had some unfavorable development to them. And then you also look at the expense that was applied for the accidents that we had this year. And so we'd expect that things should get back to normal next year. And a lot of that and the reason that we've got the favorable trend over the long-term is the focus that we have on safety continuing to invest in technology on our units and continuing to invest in training on proper safety protocol for our drivers. And I think that's played out long-term and the improvement that we've seen in our accident frequency ratios, as well as the general severity of trends. But like many of the other carriers, we will be facing some inflation on the premium side. We're kind of in the midst of renegotiating that this year. But we have -- the majority of kind of our auto expense is related to the self-insured piece that we fund. So we'll have the increased hit on premiums. And then we'll just continue to look to manage, and hopefully mitigate any inflation on the self-insured piece that we're on the hook for. Ravi Shanker : Got it. So do you feel like the inflation would have been much worse if you didn't have the deck? Adam Satterfield : Sure. Obviously, the technology has helped. It's hard to say one-for-one, but we certainly -- we spent a lot of time going through and evaluating the technology over the years as we put it in the trucks, but we feel like we've got good technology, the accident avoidance systems that we have in place now the forward-facing cameras and collision detection systems and so forth. Certainly, we would expect to see that continue to play out with reduced accident severities over the years, and hopefully, preventing accidents one would be the ultimate objective, but certainly lessening the severity is a benefit to us all. Ravi Shanker : Got it. And just one last one. The last few years have been probably the most volatile that the industry has seen in a long time. It doesn't look like it's going to get much better, especially with changes like e-commerce and new entrants and such. What are your views on consolidation in this space? And kind of where do you think the LTL space looks like five years from now? Do you think it looks similar to where we are today, or do you think it looks meaningfully different? Greg Gantt : Well, I'm not sure that at this point Ravi, we see much of any change in the LTL space ahead of us. I think our competition has been relatively stable. We lost a couple of smaller carriers in the last year or so, but I think it's been relatively stable and we don't see anything that would change that in the near future. But certainly, I think to some degree over the years we've lost competitors as you know. But I think it's we're in a good spot right now. I think we're well positioned. I think the things that we've done from an expansion standpoint, from a capacity standpoint puts us in a good spot, but I don't think from a competitive standpoint we'll see that many changes. Ravi Shanker : Very good. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Jordan Alliger : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I know density is sort of the key over the long run to improving OR. I'm just sort of curious given the declines that we saw in LTL tonnage in 2019, as you think ahead and hopefully we get to an inflection on industrial production and industrial outlook. What sort of volume growth do you need to start improving OR again on a year-over-year basis would you say? Is it just something? Is it a certain order of magnitude to make up for the impact in 2019? Thank you. Adam Satterfield : There's not necessarily a volume growth number. And I think we proved that in the first and second quarters this year when we were still seeing some weakness. Certainly, you need some revenue and you got to have revenue to offset the high fixed costs that are inherent in our network. And so we saw that still in the second quarter of this year when our revenue growth was about 2.5% on a per day basis and we were still able to produce a little bit of operating ratio improvement. So there's a balance that's required. And over the long run, when you look at our long-term revenue growth rates of 12% to 13%, it's kind of been made up of about 8% or so on kind of the shipment volume side and then the balance in yield. And so the density is certainly important, and -- but staying ahead of the density with the continued investment in service center capacity that always gives us that ability to grow into the network that we've built. But you've got to have a consistent yield management process in place as well. And when you look over the long run, we've been able to get on a revenue per shipment basis improvement in kind of an average of 4.5% a year. And that's somewhere around 75 basis points to 100 basis points higher than the long-term trend on our -- of the cost on a per shipment basis improvement in kind of an average of 4.5% a year. And that's somewhere around 75 basis points to 100 basis points higher than the long-term trend on our -- of the cost on a per shipment basis. And so you got to have that delta in place though to support high-dollar investments that we're making in our service center network to support investments in technology and all the things that we want to do to try to keep that per unit cost inflation down as much as we can. So there's a lot of factors that go into it. And unfortunately we've had a really nice balance of density and yield over the years. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Adam Satterfield : Thank you Operator : We'll go next to Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Hey. Thanks. Morning, guys. Adam Satterfield : Good morning, Scott. Scott Group : So when I look at the other LTLs looks like they are seeing more of a recovery in December-January tonnage trends relative to you guys. I'm wondering your thoughts or any -- is this a sign to at all the competitive environment getting maybe a little bit worse? Adam Satterfield : We haven't seen any signs of things getting worse if you will. I mean, I can't comment on what the other carriers are doing. We can only comment on what we're seeing. And we feel good to see the trends kind of come back in line if you will on the volume side. And as Greg mentioned there's still a lot of positive comments that we're hearing from customers feel like that forecast for industrial production to increase this year. We've got maybe some clarity now with some trade deals done. And so there's a lot of reasons to be positive as we transition into this year. And I think the other thing that we'd like to see and hope to see I guess as well as now that once we get through the first quarter and we've still got a pretty healthy comp with revenue and yield in the first quarter, but once we get through that period and we start getting to the 12-month point of where we started seeing some increased discounting by some of our competitors. If truckload rates start increasing that increases the line all cost for many of our competitors perhaps some of our customers that we might have lost some business on aren't satisfied with the level of service they've received over the past 12-months or the competitor is not satisfied with the operating ratio with a lower price inherent that maybe some of those bids come back and we'll start regaining maybe a little bit more of the business that we lost. So a lot of things to sort of look forward to as we start progressing into 2020. Scott Group : Okay. And then Adam you mentioned I think 4% cost inflation this year. I'm wondering is that normal? Is that better or worse than normal in terms of cost inflation year? So when we get -- hopefully we get back to some revenue growth and a more meaningful revenue growth starting in the second quarter. Any thoughts on how we should think about incremental margin? Adam Satterfield : Yes. Obviously, we need the revenue to start having that conversation again. But we've got a lot of things that we should be able to do I think and can help ourselves grow in into the fleet is one of those that should help. That 4% is kind of in line with what our longer-term trends have been. Most of that is based on the wage increase to employees last year but probably anticipating like we mentioned some health cost increases the premiums on the insurance. There are some other things that are going up that might move that kind of underlying number north of the 3%. But certainly we're going to do everything we can to help ourselves. And last year our number was probably a little bit higher than we came into the year thinking 4% to 4.5%. It was a little bit higher than that but a lot of that was the volume weakness. So you've got overhead cost on a per shipment basis that are going higher than what you would expect. So if we can't get the revenue growth, we should be able to get some leverage there. On the repair side like, I mentioned earlier we face some significant cost headwinds there this year where adding all of the power units that we did and not really maximizing the miles and utilization you're still maintaining all of that fleet. So if we kind of grow into the fleet that we have should get some leverage on that side as well. So certainly, some areas that we should be able to get some leverage on as we progress through the year. Scott Group : Okay. And just last one quickly. The CapEx guidance I think it's the lowest in six or seven years on tractor trailer down a lot. Should we think about this as sort of a one year or so equipment holiday or something longer? Adam Satterfield : No. I think it's a one-year kind of deal. And again, we went into last year thinking that we would have somewhere in kind of the mid single-digit tonnage growth and it ended up being down. So I think that gives us room to grow into it. And we want to be good stewards of capital and trying to evaluate kind of where the fleet is and how we think we can go into it. And obviously if volumes pick-up more than what we might expect then certainly we can respond and have been able to do that in our past life as well. So we'll make whatever changes that are necessary. But typically we spend about 10% to 15% of our revenue on CapEx. And I think when you look at sort of the breakdown the expenditures for real estate are pretty much in line with -- as a percent of revenue with what we've seen in the past. This will be probably a one year holiday on the fleet side, and then we'll just get to the end of this year and sort of evaluate where we are and what we feel like we need going into 2021. Scott Group : Okay. Appreciate the time guys. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good morning. So, I just wanted to go back to your comments about share gains? Because I think last quarter you talked about recapturing some business from customers that had left earlier in the year to take advantage of lower rates and that may be contributed to what you started to see in terms of volume stability and more normal seasonal trends. So I was just curious to know if this also played out in Q4? And to the extent that it did, was there any change in the pace in which you're seeing these customers come back, basically just trying to gauge whether this is something that you would normally see happen in advance of a recovery. Greg Gantt : Allison, we have continued to see some business return that we lost over price prior. Earlier last year, we have continued to see that business come back to us for our service. So, I don't think there's a huge change in the trend. We did continue to see our share gain increase slightly over the year, which was good to see, because we've seen it in other down economic cycles where our share gain actually slowed or diminished completely. But this year so far, that numbers continue to increase slightly. So, I think that's a good thing. But we are still -- we're winning some bids and we are gaining some business back that we lost. At what pace? It's kind of hard to gauge. We don't measure those things. So, anyway and that'll -- we are having some gains still. Allison Landry : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then Adam, could you walk us through the monthly weight per shipment trends in Q4 and January. I'm sorry if I missed that if you said that earlier in the call. Adam Satterfield : The tonnage or the weight per shipment? Allison Landry : The weight per shipment. Adam Satterfield : Okay. So on the weight per shipment, just to kind of go back a little bit and this is another one of those points that give us a little bit of confidence going into this year. But if you recall we kind of hit a low point on our weight per shipment back in August of 2019. And then we started seeing a little bit of movement north there. So, on a year-over-year basis through the fourth quarter still down. We were down 1% in October. We were positive 0.4% in November on a year-over-year basis, and then down 0.7% in December. But the trends when we look at it, we had hit that sort of 1,530 mark in August. It came back to around 1,600 pounds by the November and December time frame. So most of those I would say kind of moved -- for the quarter kind of moved in tandem with sort of what the normal sequential trend might be, but certainly a positive development than where we were for January it\u2019s down versus 2019, but it's pretty much in line with down sequentially about like our 10-year average. So, we're back to 1,554 pounds in January of this 2020. The weight per shipment kind of held up a little bit in January of last year before we started seeing some sequential weakness. I feel like we're in a good spot there, and hopefully we'll see that trend on the weight per shipment side stay pretty steady and see some steady improvements we progress through the year. Allison Landry : Perfect. Thank you, guys. Operator : We'll go next to Ari Rosa with Bank of America. Ari Rosa : Hey, good morning, guys. So first off, next quarter in a tough environment. But -- so, when I hear your outlook or kind of what you're saying about the operating environment, some of the truckload carriers really kind of diverted attention to a second half recovery, but it sounds like you guys are a little more optimistic there. I just wanted to make sure I'm hearing that correctly? And do you think there's something unique about LTL, that's maybe different from truckload that's causing that dynamic? Adam Satterfield : Yeah. I don't know that there's anything any different. And I guess it's easier to say that the back half of the year should be better than the first half, because we're in the first half. And frankly, we're not seeing in numbers that are there to write home about when we think about long-term growth and how we've been able to generate this revenue improvement and growth in pre-tax income and so forth, being flat is not kind of what we aspire to be if you will. But it just feels like things are starting to turn a little bit. And there's just little positive developments here and there. We'll see kind of as it takes hold. I think that we still have to be cognizant of the fact that there are political risks, and we're in an election year. And historically speaking volumes have kind of underperformed seasonality slightly in election years. So we kind of keep all of that in mind but we finally saw ISM go back above 50 and just continue to have conversations with our customers that we're probably \u2013 it's not like its robust growth expectations or anything like that from our customers but they're more positive than there are negative conversations. So we're cautiously optimistic as we go through the first part of the year and that's probably the best way to describe it is cautious optimism. Ari Rosa : Okay. That's helpful. And then second you mentioned a couple of times just weakness in the industrial economy specifically, maybe you could talk about the split in terms of what you're seeing between industrial versus some of your more consumer-oriented customers? And then just a bit of a strategic question. Do you think there's an opportunity, or is it something that is a compelling idea to maybe look to build a book of business more in the consumer space, or is that not something that's really being entertained too much for various reasons? Adam Satterfield : Yes our \u2013 the book of business really didn't change a whole lot this past year. Our numbers were pretty consistent in terms of the breakout of retail and industrial. So it's about between 55% to 60% industrial closer to the 60% range and then kind of the 25% to 30% on the retail side closer to the 30%. And then hodgepodge of things from an SRC code basis that kind of go from there. We've seen over the last couple of years maybe more growth in our retail-related business. And I think that that kind of gets to some of the longer-term e-commerce trends and the importance that some of the retailers and vendors that are supplying product to retailers are placing on service and that fits right in our wheelhouse as we can help our customers avoid costs like chargebacks and fines and so forth by delivering on time and in full into some of these distribution centers. We can charge a fair price. But it's one that was consistent with the level of service that we're providing. And I think it benefits from a total cost of transportation standpoint. Our customers that want to use us because they end up avoiding some of those secondary costs that may come from the retailer. So it creates win-win scenarios and is definitely a good avenue for growth. But other things that maybe get more attention in that space of doing last mile deliveries and across the threshold is just something that we're really not interested in from a corporate strategy standpoint as it exists right now. Ari Rosa : No. That's entirely understandable. But I guess my question was is there an opportunity kind of given the growth in e-commerce? Obviously staying within the LTL space, not going out into final mile or something of that sort. But is there an opportunity to grow retail business particularly in e-commerce, or is that or should we expect that split of 55% to 60% industrial 25%, 30% retail to kind of continue? Greg Gantt : That's a hard question to answer. But we've got a huge sales force that's working the entire economy be it retail or industrial whatever. And as those opportunities present themselves we'll certainly try to participate. I think we've had some competitors that have been far more aggressive than we have on the retail side. So that's probably why the percentage is like it is. But certainly as those opportunities present themselves we'll be there and hopefully will be a solution for our competitors or for our customers if they have the need. And if they're looking for better service we'll be there. Ari Rosa : Terrific. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the time. Operator : We'll go next to Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Fowler : Great. Thanks and good morning. Adam maybe just to put a bow on the conversation around margins, particularly into the first quarter. Is the right way to think about the sequential margin change 1Q over 4Q is to adjust fourth quarter for the 150 basis points or whatever the impact was from the Phantom stock and normalize a little bit for incentive comp \u2013 or excuse me for insurance expense and then think about a typical 100 basis point change off of that? Is there something else we need to think about sequentially into 1Q? Adam Satterfield : I think, yes on most of your points I would really only look at this Phantom stock really as the only thing to sort of adjust and normalize for. Because as I mentioned the insurance line you see the increase there and that's the one thing that stands out but there are some offsetting credits and some of the other line items that I think will normalize as we progress into 1Q as well. And so some of that being kind of within the fringe benefit line, some being in the operating supplies and expenses as well. So you get a normalization kind of in those categories. And it really just becomes kind of the offset of that Phantom stock expense sort of 150, 170 basis points. And then you sort of look as you mentioned, about 150 basis points is kind of the average sequential change from the fourth quarter into the first. The only thing I would say with that as well though is we did a lot of good things in the fourth quarter. And oftentimes, if you kind of look at what the change from 3Q into 4Q was oftentimes when we've had periods like that where we really do well. If we do have to start hiring, it will be at a different pace. And so there could be some higher costs that maybe end up kind of as you're below maybe a trend one quarter you might be a little bit higher than next. So that wouldn't necessarily be a surprise, if we're on a normalized basis a little bit higher than what that normal sequential trend might be, if that makes sense? Todd Fowler : Yes, it does. I think so what you're saying is, if we think about how 1Q headcount trends versus 4Q, we may not see that normal change because 4Q is a little bit better. But it also sounds like from earlier in the call, if you're hiring that's probably an indication that tonnage is picking up? Adam Satterfield : Correct. Todd Fowler : Okay. And then just for my follow-up, can you talk about the available capacity in the network right now. And typically I think about your model being built to have that available capacity. And when you do see tonnage come back that you can really drive high incremental margins because you can handle that additional freight coming in that maybe some of your competitors can't. So can you give us just a sense of where you think the network is? And how much more tonnage you can handle? And just the thought process around the leverage you'd see with tonnage coming back in with the available capacity in the network? Greg Gantt : We've definitely built some capacity particularly in 2019 with the -- I think you know what our capital expenditures were they were significant last year. So we definitely built some capacity having such a flat year. As we go into this year, we continue to be flat and we're continuing to build out the network and build where we know we'll have needs in the future. So at this point in time, we're in really good shape from a capacity standpoint. Exactly what it is? It's hard to say, but probably 25% maybe even better than 25%, but we do have some capacity and I like where we are today. We've addressed the needs that we had back a couple of years ago when we were really, really busy. We've addressed those and we've been able to accomplish some of the needs that we had and I think we're well set for the future. Todd Fowler : Sounds good. Thanks a lot for the time this morning. Operator : We'll go next to Ben Hartford with Baird. Ben Hartford : Thanks for getting me in. And Adam just at a higher level as you think about cash flow in the balance sheet over the next several years. Any changes to your appetite to carry leverage? And if so or if not, I mean, how do you think about this -- the allocation of the returns to shareholders going forward? It looks like the dividend payout ratio has been stepping up, but has a lot of room to continue to move higher. So maybe you could address that as well? Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Sure. That certainly is something that we continue to look at and evaluate and we were pleased to be able to produce another 30-plus percent increase as we're going into 2020. So the payout ratio when we first started the dividend program kind of our target was we looked at the prior year and sort of wanted to have a basis of about 10% of kind of the prior year earnings. And we started out on the conservative side to make sure that we had room to continue to increase it and so forth. And we really had not -- because our earnings growth that had been so strong since we implemented that program had not really reached that threshold that we want it to be. So this year I think was a good sort of increase to kind of address that. And I think that we've moved that payout ratio north a little bit to try to at least achieve that goal and we'll continue to look at increasing the dividend as we move forward. And then on the other side would be the share buyback program and we kind of stepped that up a little bit last year as well and we'll continue to execute on that plan. And I think we've do got to balance from an overall cash flow standpoint looking at the cash coming in from operations, what we spend on capital expenditures that are planned also taking advantage of opportunities that may present themselves strategically on the real estate side. And we did a little bit of that in 2019. We ended up spending more than we had originally planned and a few opportunities kind of became available to us. So we'll continue to look at those. And then I think we just got to balance overall kind of where we are from an overall positioning standpoint our cash balances and kind of cash projections and just sort of stay true to trying to return excess capital to our shareholders as it makes sense. Ben Hartford : One final one. Any specific IT projects on the horizon either in 2020 or beyond that are of note? Adam Satterfield : We've got several projects going on. We're converting to a new human capital management system this year. We're working on an implementation of that which will be a good thing for us. And -- so we're excited to try to get that behind us. And we're always looking at incrementally, how we can continue to improve the systems that we have. And I think, when you look at our operating systems, those have all been created in-house. And some places may have plug-ins, where we've got off-the-shelf products that kind of interface with and assist. But one of the reasons we operate so efficiently is the systems that we've invested in over the years and trying to stay ahead of our competitors in that regard. So, we're always going to be looking at making incremental improvements to those programs and evaluating any other system that we think will help us. But any return or any investment rather that we make in a system, it is an investment. And there's risk that go along with that and we think that that's something that should be accounted for and expenses, we incurred the expense. And we should assume a return on any project as well. So, that's kind of the baseline of when we make that decision to pull the trigger on a project. And so, we're going to continue to look at making investments and hopefully getting returns on those investments. Ben Hartford : Appreciate the time. Operator : We'll go next to David Ross with Stifel. David Ross : Yes. Thank you. Real quick, I wanted to talk a little bit about the transition that you all have made from the AOBRDs since you were grandfathered in to ELDs. Is that fully behind you now I'm assuming? And was there any permanent impact to the business, the network, the costs from doing that? Greg Gantt : David, it is behind us. We completed that project back in the fall, but it's completely behind us. No material impact at all. Obviously, it took a lot of hard work and a big effort from our folks to accomplish it in the time that they did. But glad to have it behind us. But nothing material, I don\u2019t think to talk about. David Ross : And then last question for Adam. I guess how much would volume have to grow this year to exceed your current tractor CapEx expectations? Adam Satterfield : David, I'll say a fair amount. We've got some capacity. We looked at that recently. We've got some equipment capacity right now without a doubt. We're nowhere near peak. I mean obviously, it's slow this time of year, but we're nowhere near our peak levels and we've got the equipment to accomplish our absolute peak level right now. So we're -- we think, we're sitting in a good position. Maybe if anything still a little bit heavy on equipments or tractor certainly and trailing equipment as well. We're in good shape there. David Ross : Good. Thank you. Operator : And there are currently no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn it back over to today's speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Greg Gantt : Thank you, all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and please feel free to give us a call, if you have anything further. Thanks and have a great day. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead sir. Greg Gantt : Good morning and welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. First quarter seems like a distant memory at this point, but we were pleased with our financial results for the quarter. We improved our operating ratio to a new first quarter company record and our diluted earnings per share also increased. These were notable achievements given how challenging the first quarter was as both revenue and tonnage were down. We were cautiously optimistic at the beginning of 2020, as we believed the operating environment will turn positive. Our volumes were trending in line with normal seasonality for the fourth quarter of 2019, and January and February 2020 results were in line with our initial expectations. Things changed in the middle of March, however, and we began to realize the profound impact the COVID-19 pandemic would have on the country and the general business environment.  While no one could have fully anticipated the effects of this pandemic, the situational awareness guiding our response was developed from the crisis management planning exercises that our team periodically performs. One of the most critical things we focused on during training in this importance of timely communication with our employees, customers and vendors. As a result, we were well-prepared to communicate early and often with these stakeholder groups as we address the rapidly-changing environment. While no plan will be perfect in these types of situations, our response was coordinated, quick and effective. Once again, proving the flexibility of our people and our business. I believe our response has also demonstrated the true importance of what we have repeatedly characterized as the foundation of our success, our culture. We have long believed that our culture has differentiated us from our competition and the difference becomes most evident during challenging times. With that in mind, the safety and wellbeing of our OD family of employees was and continues to be our first priority as we address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have followed guidelines issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization related to employee health and safety, while also adhering to any national, state and local mandates within the areas we serve. Among our many initiatives, we have distributed face coverings to our employees, increased the cleanings of our facilities, limited non-employee visitors, established social distancing practices and provided resources for our employees to clean and disinfect our trucks and workplaces. We also provided non-executive employees with a special bonus payment as a way of thanking them for their extraordinary effort in serving our customers through this pandemic. The trucking industry is crucial to help ensure the availability of groceries, medical supplies and other essential products around the country. We are proud of the response of our OD family of employees as we continue to deliver best-in-class service. In terms of how we have responded to the rapid decrease in business levels associated with the stay-at-home and similar orders around the country, we have continued to focus on our value proposition of providing superior service at a fair price. In fact, we produced a record quarterly claims ratio of 0.16% in the first quarter. Our service performance has supported our ongoing price discipline, which is critical to our long-term success.  Without our long-term improvement in yields, we would have not have been able to support investments in capacity, nor improve on our superior service standards over the years. The importance of high-quality and dependable service seems to have also recently increased for many of our customers, which further supports our existing business model. We are fortunate to have so many large national account customers that remain open for business. Although these customers continue to ship goods, often on an accelerated basis, many of our customers are currently closed. As a result, our volumes dropped off pretty significantly at the beginning of April, but they have remained fairly steady ever since. This has allowed us to quickly adjust to our new daily shipments counts. The unfortunate reality of the sudden and significant reduction in revenue, however, has been a necessary adjustment to our workforce. In this case, and with the belief that business levels will be restored once the economy reopens, we implemented an employee furlough program. The duration of this program will provide health benefits for these employees at no cost and they will also retain their seniority with the company. Other measures to reduce costs have included parking certain equipment to minimize maintenance expense, while also improving the efficiency of our fleet. We discussed on our fourth quarter call that our fleet was already a little heavy as we enter 2020, which was why our capital expenditures for equipment was lower than normal this year. We will still incur monthly depreciation cost for all of our units, but this strategy allows us to maintain adequate equipment capacity for the foreseeable future. We are currently experiencing an environment unlike anything we have ever seen, but we continue to be confident that our business model works up and down the economic cycle. A majority of our costs are variable and we are doing an excellent job of managing our costs in relation to the drop in revenue. A rapid decrease in business and ongoing uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment add difficulty to our decision making process. We have quickly adjusted while also simultaneously preferring how we will manage increased business levels when volumes return. We are also encouraged by recent news that certain states are in the process of allowing various businesses to reopen. I believe our country will return as strong as ever and fully realize that responding to rapid growth can be difficult.  We know this from experience as we have seen many periods with 20% plus revenue growth. I am confident that our past experience, existing capacity and dedication of the OD team puts us in a better position than any other carrier to respond to increased customer needs whenever that time comes. I'm incredibly proud of our employees for both our performance in the first quarter and their response to this pandemic. Our employees are on the frontlines and clocking in everyday, so that OD can continue helping the world keep promises.  Thank you for joining us this morning. And now Adam will discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the first quarter of 2020 was $987 million, which was a 0.3% decrease from the prior year. The first quarter of 2020 included one extra workday, so the decrease per day was 1.9%. Our operating ratio improved 60 basis points and our earnings per diluted share increased to $1.11. These results include $10.1 million of expense related to the special bonus paid to employees in March. Our revenue results for the first quarter reflect the 3.9% reduction in LTL tons that was partially offset by the 2.6% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight.  Excluding fuel surcharges LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 3.3%. While this growth rate was lower than recent periods, our yields were negatively affected by the 1.3% increase in weight per shipment.  Our yield numbers for the month of March were flattish as compared to the same period of 2019, due primarily to a 6.3% increase in weight per shipment. It is important to understand revenue per hundredweight is a yield measurement that is not always equivalent to actual pricing. Multiple factors can have a significant impact on revenue per hundredweight, most notably being average length of haul and wait for shipments.  As an example, our average weight per shipment increased 113 pounds from February to March this year, and this contributed to $0.56 sequential decrease in revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges. The last time our average weight per shipment changed so quickly was the 60 pound decrease from June, July of 2018, which led to a $0.54 sequential increase in revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges.  Changes in revenue per hundredweight are also not linear with respect to changes in mix. We continue to negotiate rate increases as we work through bids in accordance with our long-term pricing philosophy. We also believe the price environment remains relatively rational considering the significant drop in demand due to COVID pandemic.  Our first quarter operating ratio improved 60 basis points to 81.4%, due primarily to the quality of our revenue and increased operating efficiencies. These efficiencies allowed us to effectively improve our direct operating cost as a percent of revenue in the first quarter. Our average headcount also decreased 5.2% as compared to the 5.1% decrease in average shipments per day.  In regards to our April top-line trends, revenue per day is down close to 20%. Our average weight per shipment has increased close to 10%, while shipments are trending slightly worse than revenue. Decrease in revenue also reflects reduced fuel surcharges as the average price of diesel fuel is 20% lower than it was in April 2019. Our actual results have been slightly better than we initially expected when the stay-at-home and similar orders were implemented throughout the country. We take no solace in that fact however and eagerly await the reopening of markets around the country. As usual, we will provide actual revenue related details for April in our 10-Q. Due to the unprecedented decrease in revenue we experienced in April, we implemented the furlough program in attempt to balance the number of employees actively working with current freight trends. As a result, our current number of active employees has decreased approximately 15%, as compared to April 2019. While the loss of revenues will have the de-leveraging effect on our fixed cost, approximately two-thirds or more of our costs are variable or semi-variable. We will continue to make our best efforts to match these costs with revenue, while also controlling discretionary spending. We will not over cut expenses though as we believe we are the best positioned LTL carrier to capitalize on an improving economy. Therefore, we want to ensure that we have the people, equipment and door capacity in place to support our customers when the economy and business levels return to normal. We're fortunate to have the balance sheet strength to provide us with this flexibility. Old Dominion's cash at the end of the first quarter totaled $357 million and our outstanding debt totaled only $45 million. We have approximately $200 million of borrowing capacity on our revolving line of credit and we also have communicated with our traditional lenders to discuss additional sources of liquidity if needed. In addition, we continue to generate strong cash flow from our business. Our cash flow from operations totaled $204 million for the first quarter while capital expenditures were $52.2 million. We returned $196.6 million of capital to our shareholders during the first quarter, including $178.3 million of share repurchases and $18.3 million cash dividends. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was 26.3% as compared to 26.1% in the first quarter 2019. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be 26.3% for 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we will be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we will go first to Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins : So, I guess to start off and Adam thank you very much for that color there in terms of what you're seeing so far in April. And it's encouraging to hear that the competitive environment remains relatively rational right now. Could you maybe talk for a moment about, are you seeing issues with share loss in certain markets or anything like that going on or do you feel like market share in general is fairly stable and our customers at all trying to kind of push back on rates and maybe trying to take advantage of sort of what's happening out there, just given this drop in tonnage over the last call it three, four weeks? Adam Satterfield : Jack, this is Adam. I think customers or certain customers are always pushing back on price regardless of the environment. With that said, right now, I think about every customer is getting some form of a rate reduction just by the sense that fuel surcharges are down so much and the significance of the surcharge that it can be on each customer's freight bill. So that is happening due to the 20% reduction in the cost of diesel fuel right now and the impact for each customer's freight bill in that regard. Otherwise for us, just like we said the pricing philosophy and the discipline that we've had over the years have been critically important to supporting the investments that we've made in our service centers and our service. And so we had no intention of wavering on that in this regard. And at this point, we haven't seen really any competitive behavior that\u2019s really no different than what we saw basically in the last half of last year. So I think things have been pretty disciplined in this regard thus far. And in the past recession, you saw a lot of companies that financed rate reductions through cutting employee wages and doing some other things like that. And we haven't necessarily seen those types of actions at this point either. And, in fact we just saw one other LTL company, we saw yesterday that will also be announcing I think a similar company bonus program like we had. So that would suggest that the other companies hopefully will be just as disciplined with respect to their yield management process such that we are. Jack Atkins : Okay, that's great to hear. And then I guess for my follow up question, you guys are coming into this crisis with such a strong balance sheet, loss of liquidity. How are you guys thinking about the opportunity for industry consolidation as we emerge from this over the next couple of years? And even though you're reducing CapEx this morning, sort of what's going on make you consider perhaps leaning into to this to some degree and trying to take advantage of what's probably going to be a more consolidated LTL market on the other side of this? Greg Gantt : Jack, this is Greg. That's possible, I suppose. But I think things that we've done over the last several years in trying to expand our capacity, trying to build on our terminal network and give us capacity in all the different markets that we service and particularly the big metro markets that are so critical to our future growth and whatnot. I think that's the correct strategy as we go through this. Where it comes out on the other side, we\u2019ll just have to wait to see. But again, I think we've done the right things to prepare for whatever that might be if we lose a competitor or not. Again, I think we've done the right things. I think our capital expenditure investments will help us on that side whatever it is. So feel good about it. Who knows? I don't really want to speculate on this kind of thing. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Chris Wetherbee : And just a point of clarification, I think it\u2019s helpful to give sort of the shipment color relative to where April revenue per day was trending a little bit weaker than revenue. Is that fair to say that sort of tonnage is the same relationship? I would imagine the answer is yes. But just want to make sure I understood, maybe some puts and takes that could be going on just given the mix shifts that we're seeing? Adam Satterfield : Yes. The mix in the businesses that we're seeing that are still open, weight per shipment has been much heavier than what it normally is. And I think some of that, there's probably multiple factors driving it, but some of that is just respect to which customers remain open and the fact that there's probably more demand for those customers\u2019 products. But nevertheless, the comments which are broad and rounded, just to give a sense of direction for you guys. But we're down on the revenue per day basis, close to 20%. The shipments per day are trending worse than that, but our weight per shipment is up almost 10%. So, tonnage then obviously is going to be trending better, but that big increase in the weight per shipment is also having the negative effect on reported yields like what we have already seen in March. So, changing dynamics and whenever things start to reopen, obviously at some point things will stabilize and we'll get back to more of your normal book of business and so forth. But right now we are seeing a much heavier weight per shipment across the board with the freight that we're handling. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. I guess that sort of leads into the second question, which would just be about, the discussions you've had with the customers, I know it's really difficult to sort of make predictions about what's happening from a volume perspective, but do you feel like there is sort of non-essential pieces of the business where customers are shut down and so we sort of have seen this level of activity here in late April is kind of what it feels like the bottom will be or close to the bottom will be, and then maybe we could see some potential customers opening as we move forward through the rest of the quarter or is it too difficult to tell or is another further leg down there? I know, it's difficult but any color you could give would be great. Adam Satterfield : Yes. Certainly difficult to tail at this point. We're trying to reach out to as many customers as we can. We'd like to think that the worst is behind us. We've kind of gone through this initial period where trying to figure out, which customers are open, which of our customers\u2019 customers are also open, and so that we're not picking up freight that can't be delivered and all of those present operational challenges and communication challenges. But many of our customers, they're not sure what to expect either, as they began to reopen. So, I think there is uncertainty across the board, but if we can continue to see states start a re-opening process and then I think we've got to go through the mental process for every American to figure out how they will react once businesses are open. And when we get back to normal and what the new normal means, may take some time for us to get there. But certainly, we are ready and in place. We've got all forms of capacity that are ready to support our customers when their shipping needs increase and somewhat get back to normal. Operator : We'll go next to Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison Landry : Just given that this looks to be the first time we'll see a sequential decline in revenues, at least going to back 20 years and pretty meaningful like that. Would you still expect to see sequential OR improvement? Maybe if you could speak to that? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I think that typically the second quarter is where we give the OR improvement. But you're typically seeing revenue accelerate. Typically, our second quarter revenue is about 10% higher than the first quarter, and I think what happens from a revenue basis obviously, will drive what happens with the operating ratios if things stay lower than -- we -- like we mentioned, we have adjusted many of our variable costs at this point already to this lower environment. But I think that it just remains to be seen. The revenue levels in the second quarter be higher than the first or consistent or lower, that's just still the ongoing uncertainty. But what we can say is that we have made cost adjustments. I feel good about how our direct operating costs are trending already, despite how quickly revenue did drop off. And we're looking to keep those as best we can consistent or maybe even try to generate improvements versus the first quarter. And then it just becomes a function of the overhead costs which the overhead costs we say typically run 20% to 25% of our revenues, closer to the 20%, they\u2019ve averaged probably 22% over the last few years, but close to that lower end of the spectrum when revenue trends are solid. And then it's been higher than that or on the higher end. Last was back in the recessionary environment of 2009.  So that will be the flex. But within those overhead costs, there are some variable costs there as well that we'll continue to try to manage. But not all of our direct operating costs are completely variable as well. And it takes tremendous cost to keep the network running. We've got 238 service centers today. We've got to continue to run our line haul schedules and keep our service metrics high. We're really pleased to see that our own time service remains above 99%. And we did produce the new claims ratio in the first quarter.  So all of that takes tremendous effort, especially when there's some significant freight reduction and challenges in terms of how one service center is operating today versus how it was a month and a half ago. So it's taking a coordinated effort between our sales and operations teams. We're really proud of the results that we've produced and the adjustments on the call side that we've been able to see so far in April. Allison Landry : And then just in terms of CapEx. And I know that that's been scaled back. But is there a way to think about maybe an absolute floor just to the extent that conditions are worse for longer? How should we think about maybe just sort of your sort of maintenance CapEx level? But if you could provide some color on that, that would be helpful. Thank you. Adam Satterfield : Our normal maintenance CapEx, we kind of say on any annual year would be maybe $200 million to $250 million. But we're already into this year's CapEx plan which only included $20 million of -- related to equipment. We're already into that part of the program, those will not be canceled, and some of that equipment has already been delivered as well. But on the real estate side, where the investments that we're making today really aren't supporting the growth that we would expect to see next year. There in many cases supporting growth that we may see over the next five years. So it's important for us to, in some cases, keep those projects going so that the capacity is available in particularly places where we have been tighter, the West Coast and the Northeast, some parts of the Midwest, some of the metro areas. It's really tough to get permits and do things. And so we want to keep the process going to make sure when volumes come back, particularly with a chance they can come back in a very rapid way that we've got all forms of capacity to deal with freight flows later this year but for the next several years.  But with that said, our normal annual planning process, we look at each of our service centers, what we think anticipated volumes may be over the next few years, and we focus our efforts on where prices are tight, in a slow period and much like we did in '08, '09 we will also look for opportunities. So, while the gross number today reflected some projects that we felt good about being able to defer, if an opportunity becomes available in an area that we know we need capacity at some point in the future, then we would certainly look at existing service centers and how they might be able to work into our long-term plan. Operator : We will go next to Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : So, Adam, maybe you can offer some help. So we've never seen weight per shipment up so much. I don't think we're ever seen rev per hundredweight down so much as it's going to be down. Help us think about what that actually means for the P&L, is this good or bad for earnings? Good or bad for -- does it help decrementals, hurt decrementals? And then maybe just like any good sort of rule of thumb of how to translate this? How does higher weight per shipment impact core pricing and any good rule of thumb there? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I don't know that there is a rule of thumb and some of that detail I gave in prepared comments, it's just simply not linear in terms of when you look at changes in the weight per shipment per say and how that might reconcile to revenue per hundredweight. But frankly, we're in a period where we've not seen this type of a change in weight per shipment before. Normally, it would be in an environment where the economy was really strong. The weight per shipment we saw increase kind of in the middle and end of March. I think initially a lot of that was, it seemed like, the truckload world was tightening in some places that was concerned about. Our anecdotal evidence we had was concern for some carriers to drive into a particular market and not be able to get payload out. And so, you had customers that were just trying to use capacity in any way they could. And so, maybe some heavier loads came away. Some of the stay-at-home orders were put in place, I think that we saw some of our small mom-and-pop accounts that might be closed. And so, probably more of the business that we're handling being larger national accounts, they typically have a higher weight per shipment as well. And then like I mentioned earlier, just the sheer fact that if they are essential goods, there was probably an increased demand for those. And so, there was just more widgets on every shipment that we were picking up in that regard. But, that will settled down in some regard. And in terms of how it affects overall profitability, again it\u2019s just every customer must stand on its own. That's the basis of what our pricing philosophy is. And if each customer, if we know the revenue stream both of the base rates and how we stress test the fuel surcharge, variable component of the revenue, and then we know the cost inputs then that's what we try to look at in terms of managing account-by-account profitability. That said, I mentioned that we've done a good job I think in managing our direct operating costs, and keeping those somewhat consistent as a percent of revenue despite the significant disruption that we face. So all of those cost inputs should be covered and it just becomes matter of on the big picture level what revenue in total might look like in elements of the overhead like our depreciation in particular, what type of increases we might see there. So overall it's not a bad thing to see the increase weight per shipment, usually on just a per shipment basis. It's a better thing you get a little bit more revenue per shipment when the cost to handle would be the same. But right now it's just obviously very fluid with what we're actually picking up and continuing to work through the system and the network as we speak. Scott Group : Yes, I mean, I guess I'm still not sure the answer right. I hear wafer shipment typically is good. You also have -- maybe there's more national account business which I sometimes think is bad for OR. So, again, any additional thoughts or color on how to -- how we should think about this translating to the OR would be helpful? And then I'll just add to that, how should we think about fuel, historically lower fuel can be a headwind for LTL earnings. Is that still the case? Or do we not need to think about that anymore? Adam Satterfield : I think that for the most part, we try to adjust our fuel tables to be able to have the same level or similar level of profitability by account as the fuel prices are higher or lower. So obviously, we're getting lower fuel surcharges right now, but the costs are down as well. And in regards to just the operating ratio, the only thing I can say is that what we've already said we're trying to from a big picture standpoint. And one thing, we don't manage our national accounts any different from our smaller accounts, each should stand on their own from an operating ratio standpoint. So having more of one business is not necessarily a bad thing if we got that balanced out right from a pricing standpoint. But right now, if we can hold our own with managing our direct operating costs, which are typically around 58% to 60% of revenue, if we can keep those flattish, it\u2019s then just trying to minimize any increase in the overhead type of costs, any inflation that we might see in those costs items as a percent of revenue, given the overall big picture revenue weakness that we're seeing in April. Operator : We'll go next to Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Q - Todd Fowler : Great. Thanks. And good morning. Adam, I wanted to ask about the headcount. First, I wanted to make sure, the 15% reduction that you talked about, is that from first quarter levels are is that year-over-year? And then what's the right way to think about the portion of the expense that you're still keeping? Is the health and wealth -- is the healthcare costs still about a third of the total expense or is it something different than that? Adam Satterfield : The 15% of the year-over-year, so that's compared to April of last year. Really didn't have any kind of material action in the first quarter. The 5% decrease really was just a function of kind of the ending headcount that we finished in December of last year. The headcount drifted down a little bit, but we had talked on the last quarter's call about the fact that we felt like we could handle growth, and we were just letting some natural attrition continues to take place. So it drifted down a little bit, but the April number is what reflects the furloughs that were put in place. So that's down, not quite as much, obviously as the number of shipments. But certainly we want to make sure we've got people capacity in place in the event that things turn back on and we continue to see volumes come in the network. So, feel good about kind of where we are in that regard and we'll continue to move forward and just evaluate on a day-by-day and week-by-week basis kind of where we are with volumes and revenue and how we\u2019re managing our people capacity.  In regards to the benefits, we had kind of said I think coming into this year that about 34%, so about a third as you said, as a percent of salaries and wages was the target. We did a little bit better than that in the first quarter. That number in the first quarter was about 32.5%. So, it\u2019s somewhere around of a third to 32% to 34% is probably likely, maybe a little bit higher, since we are covering the healthcare cost of furloughed employees. So, that might tick up albeit at the higher end of that scale, and kind of what our target was coming into this year. Todd Fowler : Okay. That helps. And then just for my follow-up, as you look out, if we don't see kind of a significant snap back in volumes or tonnage going forward, are there other levers that you can pull within the network to kind of adjust some of the costs? And then kind of along the same lines, would your expectation be that you might have to pay some additional retention bonuses similar to what you did in 1Q for the work that your employees are doing? Thanks. Adam Satterfield : We are already making cost adjustments in areas like general supplies and expenses and some of our miscellaneous expense items as well. So we're making every effort to eliminate cost where we can and where it makes sense and in terms of just overall kind of revenue levels, and I think Greg mentioned this in his prepared remarks is that, the good news is things have kind of settled in and our revenue levels have been very consistent. That certainly helps us from a planning standpoint, and makes it -- if not easy, but it makes it a little bit easier versus if the revenue on each day of the week was very inconsistent and choppy. So, we've been pleased to see that stability with the revenue and then we'll continue to see where we go from here. But, against our earlier comments, I feel like that we're getting to the point where we're well into this pandemic and now that it seems like some of it's coming under control and some markets are beginning to talk about reopening, you'd like to think that the worst is behind us and that we've hit a floor. But that's something that we look at each and every day and will continue to stay on top of and we're going to manage our costs to whatever the revenue level trends are. Todd Fowler : And can you share any thoughts on additional bonuses? And if you don't want to, I understand. Greg Gantt : We haven't talked about that at this point in time. So, we'll see where that goes. But we have not discussed that so. Todd Fowler : Okay. Greg Gantt : Todd, keep in mind too, a lot of our expenses are down just because of the way we've changed and things that we do on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis like travel, entertainment, and some of our marketing expenses are down. So we have covered an awful lot of expenses that we normally incur in business as usual. But there's a lot of things that are turned off that certainly will help our bottom-line when it\u2019s all said and done. Operator : And we'll go next to Ari Rosa with Bank of America. Ari Rosa : So for my first question, I just wanted to get a little more clarity there. And I know Scott was kind of hitting on this. But just maybe if you could talk a little more about the mix of business that's driving up the weight per shipment. Is that more tilted towards kind of retail and essential goods? I presume it is. And then is there an ability or even a desire on your guys part to increase the exposure to those end markets, if you could, on a more sustainable basis? Adam Satterfield : It's I would just say the long-term trend has certainly been that we've seen more growth in retail-related business. Not any kind of necessary change or any difference in that regard for what we saw in the first quarter. Most of those were trending, somewhat in line. And what we've seen in April, as you can imagine, we\u2019ve got exposure to agricultural on food and food distributors and things like that, that have been good and any type of manufacturing that would go into those types of things or other medical-related and chemical-related type of products as well. So that's kind of been the areas that have performed and have continued to give us business, if you will, in April. While some other things that if it's -- you can just sort of think about the basics and the places that are continuing to be open for business in terms of what products might be moving or not. So -- but not any kind of wholesale change. But long-term, as we've said multiple times, we think there will continue to be more of a change with respect to retail supply chains and move towards having some type of e-commerce type of presence and how that -- or the ripple effects of that throughout the nation supply chain. And we'll be in place where much of the focus on the retailers that are making those types of changes has been on carriers that offer higher service levels. And so that's been a tailwind for our business in recent years. And the fact that our service levels helped many of our customers avoid fines and charge backs and things like that, that many retailers are putting in place. Ari Rosa : Great. That's great color. And then just for my follow-up, maybe you could talk about how you think this compares to kind of the 2008-2009 period? And then, you said that you're seeing kind of rationality still in pricing among the LTL carriers. But maybe you could talk about the extent to which you think there's kind of elasticity on pricing for LTL as an industry if pricing is collapsing on the truckload side. It seems like typically, when you see higher weight per shipment, that's some truckload movements flowing into the LTL side. But with pricing down on the truckload side, how elastic is the pricing for LTL carriers as a whole? Adam Satterfield : Sure. In terms of how we entered the recession in '08 and '09, it was we sort of eased into it. The fourth quarter of '08 was down about 5% or 6%, and then we kind of went down to somewhere between 15% -- 15% to 20% drop in revenue in the first quarter of '09, and then it kind of got to its worst in the second quarter. And now, obviously, we just faced a sudden drop off in April. And really, at the end of March, we didn't necessarily see a drop-off in freight levels at the end of March. It was lower than what we expected. But really, it was, we didn't get the end of quarter buildup that we typically see. And it may have been a little bit soft, but I think that many customers still had kind of orders in the chain, if you will, and we continue to make some of those deliveries. So we held somewhat steady, if you will, from the middle of March towards the end and just missed the normal kind of end of quarter buildup. But now, and kind of as we anticipated, we saw the rapid drop-off in April, and it's obviously much harder to respond to that type of change and to be able to keep the network of 238 service centers remaining fluid and our service metrics high. So I've been really impressed with the operations team and how they've made these adjustments cutting out costs, minimizing empty miles. Our dock productivity is up. P&D productivity is looking good as well and when you think about that, I mean, our miles between stops, those types of things become more challenging when you got some customers that are closed and it just makes that job function that much more difficult and lack of efficiency. But it all goes back to the fact that over the years and the experience that our team has, we've got a lot of experience, and we've got a lot of technology in place to kind of help us plan, but it's not artificial intelligence, it's human ingenuity that's been able to keep our system running in a very efficient manner and we're really pleased with how quickly the team has adapted to these abrupt changes of just revenue falling off a cliff like the half. Ari Rosa : And could you guys touch maybe on the ability of the LTL industry as a whole to protect pricing if it's collapsing on the truckload side? Adam Satterfield : I think that as we've seen in recent years and even going back to when we were slower in 2016, we believe that LTL would continue to be disciplined. Just this year, in fact, that it's so consolidated with 80% of the revenue being in the top 10 carriers. And then when you look at many of the carriers' margins, it's not really in a position to really go out and try to trade price for volume. In fact, it's probably better to go out and try to implement more of an increase to try to shore up their profit levels. So we felt like that LTL pricing would stay more consistent, and it's held fairly steady. We faced some spotty issues last year and dealt with those. And we'll always continue to see spotty issues, and that happens even in good times. So we believe that pricing is critically important. It's obviously been very supportive to us over the years to make sure that we're getting price increases to offset our cost inflation and to support the investments that frankly customers are demanding of us to continue to support technology investments and support capacity infrastructure as well. So we believe that we'll continue to see relative discipline out of the Group, and there's still a benefit of moving freight by LTL. We were like ridesharing before ridesharing was cool. And you're sharing every customer is sharing the cost of the freight. And it's cheaper to move shipments that are less than 10,000 pounds by riding on the truck with some other customer versus the truckload world. And even when they try to dip down and do multi-stock network is not really conducive to doing that. Their equipment is not and their drivers aren't paid to make multiple stops like ours are. So I think the industry remains strong, and we'll continue to be disciplined with respect to price, relatively speaking. Operator : We'll go next to Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. So good morning, Greg. You guys referenced this a little bit in your commentary, but are you able to quantify what percentage of your customer base is SMB versus large customers and maybe essential versus nonessential? Greg Gantt : Well, we've got about 60% of our customers are contract type customers, and those are just going to be larger in nature. And in terms of essential versus non-essential, I mean, to a certain degree, about everyone's essential. And -- but certainly, we've got some smaller mom-and-pop accounts that are closed for business right now. But overall, we're seeing for down about 20% and then I'd say probably 80% is essential, if you will. That's for the most part about -- all of it's moving right now. Ravi Shanker : Got it. So Greg, you're saying 80% of your customers would be essential, obviously, not from your perspective, but from a government perspective. And so 80% of our customers are actually moving stuff right now? Greg Gantt : That's roughly the case. We cannot accurately measure everything that we haul, whether it's essential or not. But we've got a lot of different measures that we've got in place. And it's something that we're actively working on trying to determine just exactly what groups they all fall into. But we don't know exactly if everything that we haul is essential or not. Ravi Shanker : And just lastly, again, referring back to some of the commentary about share shifts and comparison to '08 and such. Obviously, a big focus for 2020 coming into the year pre-COVID while the kind of supply side catalysts on the TL side with maybe some spillover effect on the LTL side, are you sharing of any accelerated bankruptcies with mom-and-pop carriers, just given some of the supply side restrictions on the -- whether it's driver clearing house or the insurance costs, which obviously even impact LTLs as well that's made worse by the environment? Greg Gantt : We know of a lot of truckload carriers that have bankrupted or just closed, whatever. I'm not exactly sure how many that is. I read some article this week. There were a couple of thousand that had closed. But as you know, most on the truckload side, there's thousands and thousands that are like less than 10 drivers. So we know some of those have closed and gone away, but certainly haven't seen that on the LTL side. Operator : And we'll go next to David Ross with Stifel. David Ross : Yes, Greg, I guess when you guys mentioned, you didn't see a drop-off in March, and you got into April and things just fell off a cliff. And Adam, you talked about it not being a normal downturn where you see it down 5%, then maybe it gets a little bit worse over the weeks and months. But when you see it go from flat or down a few percent to down 20% in the span of 24 hours or a couple of days, how do you react to that? I mean, Greg, what are you seeing in the network with the volumes? And then what do you do in terms of shifting things around in such a short period of time? Greg Gantt : Well, good question, Dave. We could see it to some degree that it was coming because, as Adam mentioned before, we did not get the normal end of the month, end of the quarter like we would typically get. It was off. I'm not sure, maybe 15%, 20% versus normal end of the month, end of the quarter. So we saw it coming, we weren't completely in the dark. And obviously, as we kept hearing about all these shelter-in-place orders that were issued. I think at that time, it covered about 37, 38 states, something like that. Certainly, all the major markets in the country had gone to that. So we had some information, and trust me, we were prepared to deal with it well ahead of time. So obviously, we couldn't make all the adjustments that we wanted to with the snap of a finger, but we were well prepared to do it at the first of the month. And a lot of the adjustments that we made were at the first of the month. We've made some since and we'll continue to do so if need be. But we've got a lot of information out there that we look at and measure, the customers closing and all that kind of thing. And there is a lot of information flowing in and out that helped us make decisions. David Ross : What are the one or two I guess, what are the one or two things that you look at it first when you wake up in the morning, Greg? What do you focus on in terms of managing through this and the volume variability? Greg Gantt : We obviously have all the different shipment measures, the revenue levels shipments tonnage, all those things, we look at it on a company level and a region level as well. But we'll measure all those things, see where we are. Obviously, you've got to try to somehow compare the workforce to the business levels. We've done it before. So it's not fun, but it's not anything new. We managed through it in '08, '09 and similar downturns, smaller downturns through the year. So it's a little different, but obviously, we got to do it. So not fun, I can tell you that. David Ross : Well, unlike the other ridesharing companies, you guys at least make money through the ups and downs. So congratulations. Greg Gantt : Thanks. So I think, again, as Adam mentioned earlier, it's a tribute to the team. And I can tell you, we've worked extremely close over the last month or so, particularly, and everybody is on board with what we're doing. We've had numerous, numerous conference calls and numerous meetings within the walls of the building and a lot going on. Operator : We'll go next to Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : I got disconnected mid-call. So just let me know if my question has already been asked, and I'll just go back to the transcript. But Adam, I was hoping that you could kind of provide the typical sequential shipment trends from April to May, May to June? I know this year, it's completely crazy, but it would just be helpful to understand kind of the normal sequential seasonality in the shipments as you see it historically? Adam Satterfield : Sure. The April -- on a shipments per day basis, April shipments are typically a 0.9% higher than March, and May is 3.2% higher than April, and June is 1.8% higher than May. Amit Mehrotra : And then that down 20% year-over-year -- sorry, that was in shipment. But what is the normal seasonality sequentially in April that you've seen so far versus that number that you just talked about? Adam Satterfield : Well, obviously, if things are down about 20%, I hadn't really calculated necessarily for how it looks into a sequential, but that would put us down about somewhere in the neighborhood of 15% or so versus shipment levels for March. Amit Mehrotra : And then the other little nuance point I wanted to ask on the headcount, the furlough program. Is there any impact to the comp and wages per employee? I'm not sure if that program impacts the population mix that may be inflates wages per employee, just something that we should be thinking about in the second quarter. Adam Satterfield : Not on the wage side, we did talk about the fact that they will we are covering the cost of the benefits those so the fringe benefit will likely be a little bit higher right at the higher end of our normal range, if you will, as a percent of salaries and wages. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. And then obviously, you guys have a great reputation of running an incredibly efficient network. And that's a great track record. And one thing I want to understand is, as I measure kind of the line haul efficiency, is there any way you can help us think about how full the trucks are on any given period or a typical period? I'm just trying to understand like the change the potential change in load factors as you move from 1Q to 2Q, given kind of, I assume those numbers are pretty high and partly reflects the efficiency of the network. But any help around kind of load factors and how we think about that? Adam Satterfield : Obviously, load factor is something that we manage and watch on a daily basis. Unfortunately, so far, month to day, the load factors have actually improved some. You've got to keep in mind that we have multiple schedules in all of our lanes. And in a lot of cases, you just end up reducing those schedules in cases where we're down. But we do manage that very closely. And again, fortunately, month-to-date, our load factors have shown some improvement. Amit Mehrotra : Is that the best -- is that an effective proxy for margins? Or are there just so many other moving parts that load factor is one piece of it, but I'm just trying to understand, is that effective proxy for like the overall margin trends? Greg Gantt : I think you have to look at all different aspects of line haul or miles, empty miles and those kind of things. But I think load factor is the biggest thing that we can manage by. We certainly look at a key factor and that kind of thing as well. But so far, it looks okay. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. And then the last question I have very quickly is, Adam, there's a lot of questions around weight per shipment and how should we think about it in the context of margins and fixed cost absorption? And I just want to isolate for weight per shipment is really the question. So obviously, you guys manage expenses on a shipment basis, and that obviously makes sense. But if we were to keep everything equal, specifically pricing equal, the changes in weight per shipment, obviously, will translate to revenue per shipment, higher weight per shipment will translate to revenue per shipment higher, all else equal. But does that higher revenue come with disproportionate margins because you're managing the expenses on shipments? And so I'm just trying to really conceptually isolate weight per shipment, how to think about the drop-through from the revenue associated with that. Adam Satterfield : Yes. I talked around that earlier in the call. So I'll point you back to the transcript or either we can follow-up later. Operator : We'll go next to Ben Hartford with Baird. Ben Hartford : Adam, just real quick. You mentioned two-thirds cost being variable or semi-variable. What would that figure have roughly looked like say five and 10 years ago? Has that number, that proportion risen over time? And if so, why is it density? Is it internal initiatives to variabilize costs? Can you provide a little bit of perspective just over time, how that's trended? Adam Satterfield : Well, over time, the operating ratio level that we've improved, most of the improvement has come in those direct operating costs, which most of which are variable. So we've got an improvement over the years, and our overhead costs have stayed relatively consistent as a percent of revenue. But we've always, in our history, tried to work on operating efficiencies, and we have a continuous improvement process that focuses on quality and we've always made efforts through technology improvements and just general process improvement to try to optimize mainly labor cost as a percent of revenue. And so that's just that's been a focus. It will continue to be a focus. And we feel like that's an area where you've got the ongoing opportunity for operating ratio improvement. But it takes the ingredients for long-term operating ratio improvement are density, which obviously we don't have right now. And then a yield improvement process that tries to cover our cost inflation. And so over time, we've been able to leverage the additional density through the network. That too drives operating efficiencies and OR improvement. And then just having that yield contribution there. Both of those require the macroeconomic support, though. But that, it's definitely improved. Our direct operating costs have been the biggest area of improvement over the long run. Ben Hartford : Is it fair to say that as density has built over the past decade that, that proportion has risen, though? Adam Satterfield : Of variable costs? Ben Hartford : Yes. Adam Satterfield : I don't know that it's risen. It's certainly an area where we've been able to get improvement, though, in those costs as a percent of revenue. Ben Hartford : Okay. Just on the customer set, the 3PL customers that you do business with, has that proportion changed meaningfully over the course of the past month or two, have you seen 3PLs more active as a percent of your total business or less? Greg Gantt : It's probably a little early to tell. We haven't even completed one month of this. It's probably a little too soon to tell if they've had a significant change or not. Operator : And we'll go next to Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Thank for the quick follow up. So Greg, you made a comment earlier about something to the effect of if we lose a competitor. And I guess I'm curious just if you think that you're gaining any share from that competitor right now or any sort of outsized share given potential concerns there? And then maybe if you could just share any sort of thoughts or on contingency plans you guys have in place or anything like that? Greg Gantt : No, I'm not sure I want to say any more than I said prior in relation to that. But certainly, we can't tell if we're gaining any share from anybody at this point. Again, we've been through some three weeks of this pandemic so far. Obviously, our business is down, as I suspect most of our competitors' business is down, similarly to ours. But I couldn't begin to say if we've gained share from anybody at this point. We just don't know. Again, I always say from a standpoint of being prepared to gain share, to gain additional business should something happen, I think we have done the right things over the last several years. I think you all are well aware of the capital expenditures that we've made in our real estate over the last several years, in particular. We're continuing to make investments this year in our real estate. So I think we're doing the right things to be as prepared as we could possibly be. We're more concerned about our business, hopefully, coming back soon than losing a competitor. So we'll see what happens with that. But we really don't want to speculate on that. Operator : And there are no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn it back over to Mr. Gantt for any additional or closing remarks. Greg Gantt : Thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and I hope you all have a great day. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir. Greg Gantt : Good morning and welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. The OD team delivered solid financial and operating results for the second quarter despite the operating challenges we faced with the economy. Although, our revenue declined 15.5%, we were pleased to improve our operating ratio to a quarterly record of 77.8%. We accomplished this by focusing on improving our yield, managing our variable cost, and controlling our discretionary spending. Our yield management process has strengthened the quality of our revenue and profitability over the long term. Through this process, we manage profitability on an account-by-account basis. We believe this approach is consistent and fair for our customers. Is also supportive of our ongoing investments in capacity and technology while helping offset cost inflation. We believe customers appreciate the consistency of this approach, as they know what to expect from us each year. Providing superior service at a fair price is our value proposition, which is critical to our long-term customer relationships. Our team is relentless in its commitment to providing the very best levels of service to our customers regardless of the economic environment. While we contended with many operating challenges in the second quarter, including the 16.6% decrease in shipments per day, we produced a new company quarterly claims ratio of 0.1% while also improving productivity. There are many components of our industry leading service. And based on customer feedback, we believe the gap between us and our competition has widened in the current environment. It is historically become a common practice in our industry to focus primarily on cost in a recessionary environment. This narrow focus generally leads customer service failures, which is why we are so committed to the service standards that support our revenue quality. We have long believed that this creates a competitive advantage for us in our industry and it's especially critical now because the importance of high quality and dependable service seems to have recently increased for many of our customers. As evidenced to this trend, we have been awarded new business in the past few months from customers that has historically provided lower rates rather than overall value. This trend not only leads us to believe that many of our competitors are remaining relatively disciplined with their pricing, but it is also encouraging for future market share opportunities. While the quality of our revenue is critical to our operating ratio, appropriately managing our cost is just as import. Minimizing our cost inflation on a per shipment basis is an ongoing process based largely on the productivity of our employees as salaries, wages and benefits represent our largest expense. As a result of operating efficiencies and improved productivity, we are able to improve our direct cost as a percent of revenue during the second quarter. The enforcement reality of the sudden significant reduction in revenue that occurred in April 2020 was an adjustment to our workforce to balance our employee count with available work, believing that the economy could recover quickly, we implemented an employee furlough program that initially resulted in a 15.5% year-over-year decrease in our full-time employees in April. While the economy is still recovering, our volumes increased sequentially in May and June, and we are cautiously optimistic that this accelerating trend can continue. Many of our furloughed employees have been able to return to work as a result of this improvement. We took various other measures to reduce operating expenses, while also controlling discretionary spending to reduced overhead costs. In addition, circumstances associated with the COVID-19 environment created certain cost savings that are expected to diminish in future periods, such as a reduction in group health and dental claims travel and customer entertainment. Second quarter of 2020 was one of the most difficult periods I have experienced in my career. And I am especially proud of our team's ability to respond quickly and manage our operations in this environment. I think the quality of our results shows that our business model works in both good times and bad. While certain challenges will likely continue until the economy recovers, we believe there will be long-term changes to supply chains that should create opportunities for the LTL industry. With our industry-leading service, our unmatched long-term investments in service center capacity and the dedication of our OD family of employees, I'm confident that we are in a better position than any other carrier in the industry to respond to increased customer needs for LTL services. As a result, I am also confident in our ability to continue our long term, are producing profitable growth while increasing shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning and now Adam will discuss our quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $896.2 million, which was a 15.5% decrease from the prior year. Our operating ratio improved 10 basis points to 77.8%, which contributed to our earnings per diluted share of $1.25 for the quarter. Our revenue results for the second quarter reflect a 12.1% decrease in LTL tons and a 3.8% decrease in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Decrease in the average price of diesel fuel reduced our fuel surcharges, which had an impact on our topline revenue as well as our yield, excluding fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per hundredweight decreased 0.5% due primarily to the significant increase in weight per shipment. Multiple factors can have a significant impact on revenue per hundredweight, most notably being the average length of haul and weight per shipment. Changes in revenue per hundredweight are also not linear with respect to changes in our mix. As a result, revenue per hundredweight is a tough measure to evaluate, when the mix of our business changes so significantly like it did during the second quarter. While the change in revenue per hundredweight might suggest otherwise, we continue to negotiate rate increases during the second quarter and believe underlying pricing trends remained relatively consistent. We believe revenue per shipment is a better measurement, as we focus internally on maintaining a positive spread between our revenue and cost per shipment. The 4.9% increase in revenue per shipment excluding fuel surcharges, for the second quarter, was relatively consistent with the change in the first quarter of 2020, as well as our long-term trends. With respect to our revenue trend during the second quarter, revenue per day on a year-over-year basis was down 19.3% in April, but then sequentially improved in the remaining months of the quarter. Average revenue per day in June, for example, was down 11.4% as compared to June 2019. Our change in volumes also followed a similar pattern. On a sequential basis, LTL shipments per day decreased 15.7% in April as compared to March 2020. Shipments per day then increased 9.7% from April to May and increased 7.1% from May to June. The sequential acceleration and shipments in revenue has continued into July. With only a couple of days remaining in the month, our current revenue per day is trending down approximately 3% plus or minus. As usual, we will provide the actual revenue related details for July in our second quarter Form 10-Q. Our operating ratio improved 10 basis points to 77.8%, which was a record for us despite the significant decline in revenue. More than two-thirds of our costs are variable or semi-variable and our team was effective in matching these costs with the change in revenue, while also controlling our discretionary spending. Our operations team also did an outstanding job with improving efficiencies during the quarter. We have historically improved productivity during recessionary environments and from experience, we believe we can maintain, much of this productivity once we return to a growth environment. While the loss of revenue certainly had a deleveraging effect on our fixed cost, the improvement in our direct cost as a percent of revenue more than offset the increase in overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $312.2 million and $516.2 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2020 respectively, while capital expenditures were $67.9 million and $120.1 million for the same periods. We returned $146.1 million of capital to our shareholders during the second quarter and $342.7 million for the first half of the year. For the year-to-date period, this total included $306.8 million of share repurchases and $35.9 million in cash dividends. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter 2020 was 25.7% as compared to 26.1% in the second quarter of 2019. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the third quarter 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins : So, Adam, if I could maybe start going back to your commentary on the pricing environment for a moment, because I think in your prepared comments you said that the pricing environment remains relatively consistent with what you've been seeing over the past several quarters with regard to the second quarter. We have heard some anecdotes on public conference calls here over the last couple of days that maybe there's been a little bit of an acceleration in pricing, in the third quarter and I'm just curious if you could maybe talk about - have you noticed a shift in tone around pricing in discussions with your customers over the past several weeks, maybe couple of months? Adam Satterfield : I don't know that we've heard a shift in tone at any point recently. Certainly, our approach is always one to consistency and I think that's what our customers appreciate. They know what to expect out of us and we're pretty disciplined in that respect to focus on what our cost inflation is every year and the pricing, the operating ratio on an account-by-account basis that, that we try to target with our customer accounts as well. So, for us, we just continue on with our consistent approach and we've been getting increases all year long. I mean, in some cases, in the early part of this quarter, that may have impacted some of our volumes as well. But like we mentioned earlier, we are starting to see some volumes coming back to us, that's been an encouraging trend, and some of the business that we may have lost back in April. Some of that business coming back to us just based on the service that they received from the other carrier that they might have switched to. And when they look and think about the total value equation, they didn't feel like they were getting the value there and they came back to us. So that's what we'll continue to focus on is just our consistent long-term type of approach to offset cost inflation that's workforce and that's what we intend to continue. Jack Atkins : And then I guess from my follow-up question, just kind of thinking about the operating ratio, here. I guess normal seasonality 2Q to 3Q, would call for some modest deterioration, but your commentary around revenue trends per day in July would indicate that maybe revenue is trending better sequentially, but there may be - there are some temporary costs that are getting layered back in, now the business is stabilizing. So Adam, can you maybe help us kind of take me to those puts and takes and how that relates to or progression as we move into the third quarter? Adam Satterfield : Yes, it's typically is about a 50 basis point deterioration from the second to the third, but in a normal environment, which clearly we are in, and we would have seen the second quarter revenue of about 10% over the first quarter and then third quarter increase is slightly typically from the second quarter. So you get, historically speaking, most of your operating ratio improvement there in the second quarter on a sequential basis, that is. And so, in this environment, if we can keep this accelerating revenue trend, then some of the leverage that we lost particularly in overhead and within that overhead category on the depreciation, we lost quite a few basis points there from the first and the second quarter. So, if we can continue this revenue trend and revenue can meet or exceed than where we were in the first quarter, then certainly that depreciation in particular unwinds, and there should be some other costs that we unwind along with that. And we fully expect to try to maintain the productivity that should continue, certainly there will be some costs that will be coming back online in the third quarter. But given all of those factors, we certainly think that we should definitely be able to beat what that long term deterioration is simply, if nothing else, just the improvement that we should have the leverage on the depreciation. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Fowler : Greg in your prepared remarks, when you talked about the quality of revenue and kind of improving that here in this quarter, I would think that, that could maybe a little bit more challenging in a negative tonnage environment and maybe in a stronger tonnage environment where you can pick and choose the freight that you want. It's a little bit easier. So can you expand on that comment? And essentially what you're focused on and what you're able to do from a quality of revenue standpoint, right now? Greg Gantt : Sure, Todd. No doubt in this deteriorating environment that we just came through. We did see customers more likely to put out bids and rebid the freight and that kind of thing. And that was definitely a challenge for us. And Adam mentioned, some of that - some of our - we did lose some business in that process, but we gained some from others and fortunately, in other cases, we are gaining back some revenue that we lost earlier, because of they couldn't meet the service standards that they had with us. So it's ever a challenge, that's our business. And there is always you win some you lose some. But fortunately, at the end of the day, you hope that your service outshines, the value outshines your competitors. So far so good. We are regaining some of the business that we lost. That's a good thing. We've taken on some new additional business of late. So I think there have been some opportunities that did open up for us as the quarter went all and as we roll into the third quarter, so far in the month of July, it's definitely looking strong. Todd Fowler : So, Greg you said in a comment that - yeah - so some of the business that you lost earlier in the quarter, maybe was more some price sensitive business and it didn't fit as well in the network or what is this profitable, and so it's okay to see that go away, but you're starting to see some of that come back now? Greg Gantt : Yes. Coming back at our price. Right. Todd Fowler : Got you, okay, that makes sense. Greg Gantt : Coming back at our price. We obviously lost it to a lower price, but that doesn't mean the customer got a greater value and it came back because of the value we provide. Todd Fowler : Understood. Okay. And then just for my follow-up; Adam, do you have any color or anything you can share on the increase in the weight per shipment, the up 5% and kind of the level that you're at right now, is that something that you think is sustainable? Do you see that as a shift in the business that you're handling or is that indication of improvement in underlying economic activity? Thanks. Adam Satterfield : The weight per shipment is certainly been a wild swing since the trend that we had back in January and February, right when things started changing our weight per shipment increased above 1,600 pounds in March, it reached a peak of 1,677 pounds in April and then it started working its way back to sort of a - more of an average that we've seen over the longer term of about 1,600 pounds. It was right at 1,600 pounds in June. And most of that was in the early stages of some of the stay at home orders. We had more national account business that remained open. Our national account business typically has a higher weight per shipment than our smaller mom-and-pop type of accounts. And so, now some of those smaller accounts are starting to come back online. But we're still getting, I would say more business from our national accounts. They continue to be strong. And when you think about some of the companies that are performing well in this environment and that have increased demand, it's a lot of those bigger on the retail side, some of those bigger retailers and their weight per shipment just continues to be much heavier. So it's a little bit different mix. But we're happy to see it kind of coming back to the 1,600 pound range. And we expect that is more of the smaller accounts come back online. It could drift down a little bit lower, but that 1,600 pound range is continued into the July at this point. And so, if we can see that stay around that sort of level for the time being, that'd be a good trends and contributor too to the overall revenue per shipment that we're seeing. Operator : Our next question will come from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Chris Wetherbee : Maybe, Adam, I could hit back on pricing a little bit. Can you give us maybe a little bit more specific sort commentary on where contracts are kind of being reset, as you get through the quarter? I don't know how much activity was actually happening in 2Q, but could you give us just sort of a rough sense. It sounds like it's been consistent with what you've seen, but kind of curious if there is incremental color you can add? Adam Satterfield : We kind of stopped talking about the - our average contract renewals. And some of that, we hear others kind of give the same commentary and be it average increases in contracts or general increases, never seen the fully reconcile even factoring in changes in weight per shipment to what some of the others might report as their revenue per hundredweight. And so I would just say that, that looking at revenue per shipment and how that's trended, that's more in line with what we've been able to achieve with increase is kind of on average. And typically that's been between 4% to 5% and that's somewhat falls in alignment as well. We have a general rate increase that went into effect earlier this year, that was at 4.9%. And that's generally the target that we have for our contracts as well. So, in that ballpark is really what our long-term trend has been. It's what we continue to target. And it's what we've been able to achieve this year. So that it's been a good thing. Obviously, the long-term success of that program, managing our cost where there is a positive delta between our revenue per shipment and our cost per shipment managing those two factors has really been a key contributor to our long-term operating ratio improvement. Chris Wetherbee : And then maybe when you think about volume opportunities and just sort of how you want to manage your network in the context of a potentially sort of tightening truckload cycle, when we've seen these in the past, there has been spillover into the LTL market. You guys have always been disciplined about what kind of business you want to take on in those kinds of tight market who maybe not all of it is what you really do want in the network. But I don't know if it's too early to see any indications of that or maybe talk a bit about how you're thinking about handling that as you move forward. But just kind of curious what your expectations are potentially around that truckload opportunity as things kind of move in. So maybe be it would be kind of larger LTL, smaller TL type of opportunities going forward. Adam Satterfield : Yes, I mean certainly that creates some opportunities for us. And it really just gets back to our sales team, their discussions and ongoing conversations with our customers what their customer needs are. And if they've got freight that needs to be moved and we can help out, obviously volumes are off for us. Even though they're getting better, there is still down on a year-over-year basis. So we've got capacity and we're ready to help our customers whenever we can. If that's a heavier weighted shipment that might have moved by truckload, there is no such thing as bad freight, there is poorly priced freight. So if we understand all the shipment characteristics and have got good pricing practices in place, which I believe we do, then certainly we're willing to handle about any shipment that a customer would want us to. The best thing that we would see that the changing trends in the truckload world would be that if the truckload rates continue to increase. Typically, that has the effect of increasing many of our competitors cost structure. Many of our competitors use outsourced truckload for purchase transportation. So if our competitors now have got some unexpected cost inflation, that's going to put more rate pressure for themselves to go back and increase their rates typically that has the effect too of moving normal LTL business our way. So multiple opportunities I think both from a direct and indirect basis for the truckload world improving. Operator : Our next question will be from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison Landry : I was just wondering, Adam, could you give us a sense of how much the lower group health and dental expenses were in Q2? I know that you said some of that may come back in Q3 and in Q4. So just wondering if there's any color you could provided there to help us with modeling. Adam Satterfield : Yes, I mean certainly that was a benefit. Our overall fringe rate though in the second quarter was 33.6%. And we typically target about 34%. I think that at the beginning of the year, that was something that we talked about. And so just the change and we were at 34% in the second quarter of last year. So those numbers are pretty comparable from period-to-period, but probably resulted, I would just say fringes overall and $2 million, $1 million to $2 million of savings comparing what we had this quarter versus what the fringe rate was in 2Q of '19. So a little savings there. There is always sort of puts and takes in that fringe type of number, certainly we were fortunate, I guess, if you will, to see that group health and dental was down and some of the others were up. And on a sequential basis, simply having more income in the second quarter than the first that drives things like our 401(K) match that we give to our employees and it's things like that continuously improving our benefits overall and giving more paid time off and doing some of these things that continue to motivate our employees, and we think helps drive the bottom line success as well. They understand the success. They drive for the company. They get rewarded for it. So we think that's been a very motivational tool over the years for our employees and helping our culture. Allison Landry : And then, I'm sorry if I missed this earlier in the remarks, but could you give us the productivity metrics in the quarter? I think you said, sort of, they improved across-the-board, but some of the specific KPIs. And then, if you could give us a sense of where you are with furlough and just your overall view on how to think about headcount levels in the second half? Thank you. Adam Satterfield : Sure. Yes, we didn't give the specifics on the productivity, but saw really strong performance, our platform shipments per hour for the quarter improved 7.1%, our P&D shipments per hour improved 4.2%, even our line haul light mode average had improved 0.8%. And we talked about before that, that not all cost are variable, and running this line-haul network that we have serving 238 service centers, there is a fixed element of running that cost, but I was really pleased with all the level of productivity that we had and as such. When you look at our productive labor cost on a per shipment basis. So again getting things back to how they are per shipment, overall they were right at about 3% cost inflation. And that's pretty much in line with the wage increase that we gave last year. So we had improvement. We don't give this level of detail, but our P&D and our Dock costs per shipment were essentially both flat and then we had a little inflation overall in line-haul. But that would be expected based on that trend. I'd say, an update on the headcount. Overall, in June, we were down - the full time employees were down 10.5% just comparing June of this year to June of last year. So we brought many people back from the furlough program. If you look and compare April to June. The headcount is up about 4.5 overall, but if you compare kind of where we are today to where we were in March, we're down about 1,400 positions overall, which is about 7%. And based on where we are, our shipments per day should be higher in July than they were back in March. So that was kind of what we've talked about in the prepared remarks that unfortunately when we go through an environment like this, we've made adjustments like, we have, but you find areas of productivity when each department leader is going through evaluating their costing and costs don't save them sales. It takes action and a plan. We've gone through and we've figured out ways to be able to do more with less. And I think that's what we're seeing now. But if our accelerating trends continue, we certainly will have to continue to bring back some more employees, we fully expect and we'd like to that, because they go hand in hand with the increase in volumes. But I think overall when you look at sort of the level of headcount with the volumes, those should come back in alignment and eventually show some improvement there. Operator : Our next question will come from Jason Seidl with Cowen. Jason Seidl : I wanted to talk a little bit about the residential delivery, as one of your competitors basically said they saw an uptick, almost a doubling in the percentage. It's still ticked down a little bit for them, but definitely above the prior year. Can you talk a little bit about your experience with the residential market and how you see the margins there for OD? Adam Satterfield : Jason, we do not measure the number of residential deliveries that we had. And I did anecdotally hear a whole lot of commentary about additional residentials. I know we had a few more in one segment of our business, but I don't think we saw a significant uptick in residentials at all. Jason Seidl : And would you say that the margins on your residential deliveries are equal to or better than the regular margins? Greg Gantt : We, Jason, as all of our accounts, we price on based on the cost of those accounts require, and we price them accordingly. We price in the residential stop, there is a fee for that, as you know. We price them accordingly based on the cost. So I think that's an account-by-account basis, but they are not necessarily better or worse than the other businesses. Jason Seidl : And my follow up is going to be on any potential acquisitions and the outlook. I know in the past you mentioned your desire to potentially add some, I guess, business lines that would be complementary to your LTL operations. We've also been here in the marketplace that the appetite for acquisitions as picked back up a little bit from sort of the start of COVID. Wondering what your thoughts on that going forward. Greg Gantt : At this point in time, Jason, we - maybe we have somewhat of an appetite for an acquisition. I just - I don't know who that is or exactly what that is. At this point, we're not looking at anything currently. And we always have opportunities across the desk and we evaluate those as they come along, but currently, at this time, we're not looking at anything in particular. Operator : We'll now take a question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : So Adam just on the 3% drop in rev per day in July. I missed it, if you said so, but directionally, can you talk about sort of the tonnage, weight and yield trends within just directionally? Adam Satterfield : Yes. A lot of that is mainly on the tonnage. And so you've got some of the yield, if you will, sequentially that, that's moving up a little bit, but yeah, we're continuing to see acceleration essentially on the shipments and the time and our yields continue to perform as well. But overall, it's good to see. Obviously that coming back closer to kind where we were last year after going through the second quarter and revenue being down double-digits and certainly it feels a lot easier to manage and should produce a lot more opportunities, once we can get back to the revenue being flat and eventually get back to a growth environment, which is what we're more used to. Scott Group : And then I just wanted to ask a bigger picture question. So you're seeing the biggest revenue drop in a decade. And you put up record margins and by the way, it's not just you, we've seen this from some of the other trucking companies this quarter. And I'm just trying to understand how this is happening? You mentioned a little bit of that healthcare cost, but do you think there is anything else unusual from a cost standpoint, either fuel or lack of congestion or something else? I guess and ultimately what I'm trying to figure out is next year we're going to have good volume and revenue growth, hopefully. So should we be thinking about strong incremental margins next year and getting to a mid '70s operating ratio? Or is next year, a year, we get the revenue, but maybe we don't get the incremental margin, because there were something that was just unusual helping in this environment? I guess that's the question. Greg Gantt : Scott, let me say this. There were certainly some things that worked in our favor, not just ours, but probably the entire industry. Obviously the traffic congestion was a lot less than it has been in the past. We did save some money on the group health, and had less spend on customer entertainment, some marketing - areas in marketing were down from what we normally see. So there were some things that did say some short-term tight cost. But I'll say this, when this thing first started, we sat down as a management team and we made a plan. And the one thing that I made very clear was we had to execute on that plan. We didn't dillydally, we executed and I think everybody took it very serious what they had to do. Our big concern was continue to give the type of service that our customers are used to. We didn't cut anything from that standpoint, we're very pointed and determined in our efforts to continue those all of different service measures that we have and to continue to improve on those. We did it. And I think you saw it in a reduced claims and our own time percentage was still above 99%. So we did not slack off in any way, shape or form from that standpoint. And I think our customers accepted it, while we may have saw some business walk for price early in the quarter. It started to come back later in the quarter as they realize they weren't getting what they were used to with OD. So, yes, there were some areas where we did save some money. But we did a lot of the things that we had to do to help our sales from a productivity standpoint. So, yes and good. Certainly, we made a lot of things happen that we're very proud of at this point in time. As far as next year, certainly, we think that there is an opportunity to continue to have the same type of productivity levels of improvement that we had in the second quarter. You can, measure it from there. We certainly expect our revenue growth to come back. Not exactly sure where that's going at this point in time. Who knows where the economy is going to go, we're facing a lot of things later this year and on in the next year with the election year and all that, but a lot of challenges ahead, but we do definitely think, if we have some growth that we can drive however lower. I don't think there's any doubt about it as we've said before, we think we can manage through the good times and the bad. I think we've proven that in the past, but I don't think there's any doubt. We will continue to prove that into the future. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Ross with Stifel. David Ross : Just a follow-up on that a little bit specifically as it relates to fuel. It seemed to be a tailwind for a lot of carriers in the quarter, what was the impact, Adam, of the sharp drop that we saw from March to April in fuel, was it a good guy in the quarter, significant --? Adam Satterfield : Dave, we've tried to structure our fuel tables to really where they don't really impact us on the bottom line, too much one way or the other. We got hurt a little bit a few years ago back in '16 and really didn't have the lower end of our table where it needed to be, but we address that throughout the year and then fully address that when the next GRI came about. So net-net, we try to do some back of the envelope type of calculations and believe it was fairly minimal, on a net basis. Maybe overall slightly good. But the hard thing to try to negotiate and do these back of the envelope type of calculations is the simple fact that fuel is just another element that's pricing, that's negotiated with our customers. So, if you've got somebody that, that wants to make in this environment look like their base rates were that, that they didn't take an increase, but we got an overall improvement in our fuel contribution or some other type of element that really gives us the same level of revenue then that just becomes a tool to negotiate with. So it's really hard to try to make that comparison. But I'll say that the change on the call side, I mean obviously it hit us hard on the topline. And then on the cost side, you see the change and the improvement in the operating supplies and expenses, a big driver of that not all of it, but a big driver of that was the decrease in fuel typically when fuel changes so significantly like that in a period, you'd see the corresponding increase in your labor cost. And I think that hit kind of mask the overall improvement, if you will, to keep our labor cost essentially flat like we did in this environment with the surcharge revenue being down so much. It was really impressive to me and I thought that was the biggest driver in our ability to improve the operating ratio was what we were able to accomplish with all of those labor cost as a percent of revenue. David Ross : And then, another thing impressive has been the insurance and claims line item, it's been remarkably low and steady in a tough insurance market for a long time. Can you talk a little bit more either Adam or Greg about what really makes it a non-issue for you guys and not something that investors have had to worry about on the expense you probably just had. Adam Satterfield : Well, there is two elements that go into that insurance and claims line, that's our auto accidents. We call it BIPD. The bodily injury and property damage in the cargo claims. And fortunately for us, our cargo claims has consistently improved and almost non-existent at a record 0.1% for this most recent quarter. So that element has come a long way. You go back to the recession, when I felt like we really differentiated ourselves the great recession of '09, when we really differentiated ourselves from our competition. We are above 1% and we believe that, that's where the industry average is likely still north of 1% from the data that we get and feedback from customers. So that's a good thing that we've consistently driven that claims ratio down. On the auto side, certainly this year and it's in the second quarter, like most of the other carriers, we're facing significant inflation with our insurance rates, but we've been very fortunate with the fact that all the investment in new equipment and safety systems and training and so forth that we've made over the years, those all have accident mitigation type of tools with them. And our tractors now and then just continuous training on the Dock and other places and that we've done. And so there is an element that goes into this line, there is an element in our salaries, wages and benefits that goes hand in hand with those safety programs. And we continue to see workers' comp which is in the benefit line to improvement there. And so I think it's just, it's been a focus of our company that have safety programs in place and always be trying to continuously improve those and I think we've seen a big benefit, the insurance line is one, but, there is a hidden one that's in the fringe benefit line on the workers' comp that goes hand-in-hand. So if we can just keep our accident frequency ratios low those continuously improve and try to keep severity low as well and some of that's mitigated by the investment in technology on the tractors. And hopefully we can keep that line item consistent like it has been in that 1% to 1.2% type of range. Operator : Our next question will come from Ari Rosa with Bank of America. Ari Rosa : So, Greg, you mentioned in your opening remarks, some lasting changes to supply chains as a result of the pandemic, which you think could benefit LTL carriers. I was just hoping you could elaborate on that a little bit and get into some details. And then maybe in the process touch on what kind of e-commerce volumes you're seeing and if you've seen a big uptick in demand on that front and how it might impact your business? Greg Gantt : We did see increases on those e-commerce type accounts. We did see some big revenue jumps with those particular accounts on the inbound side for us particularly. I think you know we don't participate in a lot of home deliveries and that kind of thing, but there is another end of that. So we did see some upticks on those accounts, which is a good thing. And that was really what those comments we're pointed towards. I think we'll continue to see those type of customers business basis grow. So I think that's a good thing for us generally speaking. Ari Rosa : And does - do the characteristics of that business from either pricing or kind of weight standpoint vary in terms of how it impacts your costs. I mean, I imagine you're still going to be pricing appropriately as you've kind of hammered home for years. But how does that business vary in terms of its characteristics? Greg Gantt : Those accounts, Ariel, they have practically everything, they have a very, very wide variety of products. So, yes, each account that goes into those is vastly different, but they are all priced accordingly. So I don't think there is anything different generally speaking than with a lot of our other accounts, but we will price them accordingly. Regardless of the product. Ari Rosa : Got it, thanks. Greg Gantt : Yes - I was just going to add that we've seen growth over the last couple of years in our retail-related business. It's close to 30% of our overall revenues that were still closely align with the industrial sector. But, nevertheless, that business has been growing. So this has been a trend that's been evolving but certainly accelerating in this environment and things are going to completely change overnight. In terms of supply chains and whatnot, but certainly we feel like that more fulfillment centers, things of that nature, as they continue to be built around both the landscape and much of the freight that will be inbound those fulfillment centers will be more conducive to the LTL type quantity shipments. And so we certainly believe that we've already been winning business in that area and can continue because to be able to maintain the manage inventory quantities and the number of SKUs that they want to have in those facilities. You've got to have tight inventory controls and that requires confidence in your carrier to deliver on time and without damage and certainly, I think we've proven that we do that better than anyone and I think that we'll be able to continue to participate and that element of the business continuing to give us a little market share. Ari Rosa : And then I just wanted to touch for my last question on, the operating ratio and I know this is obviously, you guys have addressed this a bit, but really impressive. On the cost front, is it appropriate for us to be thinking about a sub 80 operating ratio is kind of the new plateau and would it be a surprise to see that tick back up if congestion returns the highways and that sort of thing and then in the past you've occasionally provided a view on where you expect incremental margins to be I think you've kind of talked about something in the 25% range, should we be looking for kind of a step-up based on, based on this quarter, and just the impressive performance you're able to deliver. Greg Gantt : I mean certainly there will be some costs that will come back into the business and we'll be prepared for those, but there should be other cost savings opportunities. Keep in mind with the big drop in revenue that we saw typically when you look long term it's the density, the revenue per service factors is that has increased the operating ratio has improved and when we look at individual service centers and regions around the country. We know that we've got ongoing opportunity to improve our operating ratio and it really is driven down to the service center level. When you look and think about all the dollars that we've invested over the years and expanding our door capacity and then the individual opportunity to improve the service centers ratio, all those 238 service centers roll up into the company average. And you might have some that we've just expanded and maybe curve, the operating ratio, but you've got a much larger group that we're leveraging all the fixed cost there because we own most of our facilities, and so it gives us confidence that we can continue to drive this operating ratio lower once the density factors come back, but it's the density and the yield and both of those generally require a positive economic backdrop to support each. Those are the two key really to drive long-term operating ratio improvement and we're going to continue to focus on those. It's a matter of managing revenue quality and cost and we've got to consistently do both. We've got to continue to look for ways that we can keep our cost inflation low while continuing to also give the service to our customers that provides value and allows us to get the consistent rate increases that we need as well and so this just continues to build on itself and also allows us to do. The most important thing and that's taken care of our employees and keep them motivated keep on them engaged to continue to give service to be productive that employee and our family culture that we have is really what's been driving our long-term success. When we want to make sure that we don't miss out on that element as well. Operator : Our next question will come from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : All the good questions have been answered. Asked to answer. So, I guess, I'll have to ask a couple of bad one. So forgive me. I'm just want to think about the sequential, I mean, I know OR is kind of an output of various moving parts. And as I think about the sequential movement from 2Q to 3Q, I just wonder why the output won't actually be more challenge, especially given what's happening in the weight per shipment side, because correct me if I'm wrong, Adam, you mentioned that weight per shipment kind of was volatile, but then maybe went down towards the end of the quarter. So as shipments are going up, weight per shipment coming down, you're adding resources just to serve the shipments, wouldn't that represent, I mean, it's maybe overly simplistic, but doesn't represent maybe an incremental headwind on the OR as we think about kind of moving parts. If you can talk about that? Adam Satterfield : Yes, I mean, certainly there are a lot of moving parts right now as we work our way through this environment. And so, yes, sequentially, the weight per shipment is coming down, but all up on a year-over-year basis, our weight per shipment was pretty low last year in the third quarter. But I think that we'll continue to keep our focus on maintaining our revenue quality. And if we can keep that revenue per shipment high, which will - we have no intent to change anything related to our pricing philosophies, a little bit lower weight per shipment, then certainly can. If you've got the same cost per shipment to handle, then that can put a little compression on that individual shipments margin. But again getting the leverage from the revenue growth, like, we talked earlier that's, if you just sort of run out for the quarter kind of this trend that we're seeing in July, you'll have significant improvement sequentially in revenue. And so, the leverage that can come from that is significant and should offset any other type of challenge that we have, typically our overhead cost average 20% to 25% of our revenue. And in the second quarter, they were about 24%. It's a period with revenue weakness. And even though the aggregate cost, absolute cost were lower on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter and they were lower in the second quarter than the first that some of the action that we took, we obviously saw a lot of the increase in those cost as a percent of revenue due to the revenue weakness. But sequentially if we can show that improvement, there - and not increase as overhead costs, you're going to get a lot of leverage there and we'd expect to be able to work that 24% back down closer to the lower end of the range. Certainly it will be the idea. And then we just got to keep the focus, and I can assure you we will on maintaining all of our labor to revenue statistics, all of our productivity across all areas of the operations, that's the biggest cost element that we have, but again when density comes back into the network as we are talking about our line-haul cost earlier, that should improve that line-haul costs that's more semi-variable. So the density coming back in the revenue, certainly, that should give us much more opportunity than any other pressures related to a little bit lower weight per shipment should present. Amit Mehrotra : And then, I don't if I missed it, did you talk about year-on-year tonnage in July? I wasn't sure if you had mentioned that or not? Adam Satterfield : Well, I just generally said, July is now done and we got out of the habit of giving the number in the middle and even though we've got two days left, but given an interim month exact number and then the comparison that created and sometimes panic or sometimes exuberance that maybe neither was warranted of the change between the day of call and then what the actual number was. So I kind of talked around it, I guess, but we're down - the revenue is down about 3% sort of plus or minus at this point and we'll see where we end up with these next two days of revenue. And the weight is somewhat in that - the weight per day is somewhat in that same ballpark. So that's continued to show improvement from where we were in June. And July has been a really strong month. Typically July is a month that the revenue falls off a couple of points from June. And to see, the revenue continued to accelerate and we've actually got revenue per day that is higher in July, certainly that's a big benefits and provides us with a lot of encouragement as we go through the third quarter to see if these trends continue, because usually July is the weakest month of the third quarter. So we'll continue to see how these trends play out, but certainly gives us a lot of encouragement to see our customers continuing to reopen their business to increase the levels of business they're giving us an and some of the new wins that we've been able to create, while our sales team hasn't even really been out - be able to be out on the street, making sales calls. So it's been a coordinated effort, and our sales team got to give them a lot of credit for having to change the way they operate, how they communicate, but the coordination between our sales, cost and pricing team and continue to stay engaged and strengthen relationships with our customers. I think that's a big piece of not only our long-term numbers, but the improvement that we're starting to see as we go into the third quarter. Greg Gantt : Let me add that. We saw our revenue trend start to improve in June. And, so far, through the month of July, they've continued to be very consistent and they look down the line. If you look at revenue per shipment, weight per shipment per hundred and all of those different things that we measure from a revenue standpoint, they're all consistent and look very good so far. So we hope that trend will continue. But we are encouraged by not concerned at all. We are very encouraged at this point. Operator : Our next question will come from Jordan Alliger with Goldman. Jordan Alliger : Just a big picture question, your service standards have always been tremendous part of competitive advantage in the LTL space. I'm just wondering, the industry itself, competition or is the competition catching up, we're doing things in the right direction. Does that impact the gap between you and the competition or is it still so head and tails above everyone else with the competitive advantage generally remains. Greg Gantt : Jordan, let me say, first off, everybody has service standards and filing a lot of cases they're very similar carrier-to-carrier. Ours I think are in line with most of our competitors are better. But service runs a lot wider gamut than just A to B on time. And there is still a lot that goes into service. And I think that's where OD excels compared to our competitors. And if you look at all other things that we've done over the years and we talk about the low claims ratio, but that's a big part of it. A to B on time is a big part of it. Our employees are engaged. They know what their role is, as it relates to service and they execute on that role every day. Whether it's a Dock worker or the person that answers the phone in the office and talks to our customers, how they deal with our customers. Making timely pickups, making appointment times, all of those things. There is just an awful lot of elements that go into service. And I think we measure up far better than our competitors on the day-to-day basis. And that's why I think when we sometimes lose business over price, but it comes back because of service and at the end of the day, we're getting it back and we're getting it back at our price. So there is an awful lot that goes into that. We've put a lot of work into that over the years and it's paying off. So we will continue to focus in that area and continue our commitment to our customers. So it does make a difference. Hope that answers your question. Jordan Alliger : Yes, that's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Unidentified Analyst : This is Christine on for Ravi Shanker. Thanks for squeezing me in here. And so, maybe circling back to some of the commentary around e-commerce and sort of a tangential theme to that, are you guys seeing any or do you expect to see any sort of boring of lines between the LTL and TL operation kind of moving forward over the next couple of quarters and years, I think, the policies to be shortening on the TL side and on the LTL side, seems like the shipments are getting a little bit heavier, are you guys seeing any, again more blurring there? Greg Gantt : Not that we can tell to be honest with you, no. Yeah, certainly, I think as suppliers try to get closer to their customers, the TL length of haul would get shorter, but we haven't seen that trend at all in our business. I believe the haul has been very consistent over the last several years. And to be honest with you, if anything, we're seeing a little bit of an increase of late. So if there is blurring our lines, we can't see it. There is still a pretty big distinction. Unidentified Analyst : And then maybe just one follow-up, sort of bigger picture. As your strategy evolved at all in the last couple of months around, you know, electric vehicles, whether that's in P&D or maybe some shorter haul, other short-haul operations for you guys with some of the developments that we've seen from the OEMs in the last couple of months here? Greg Gantt : Well, to say this, I don't think that technology has evolved to the point that it's all that useful for us yet. There is still a lot of issues with it. I know we all hear see and read things that sound good, but I'm not sure of the practicality in our particular company, it's just not - the technology is not there yet. We can't make it work, as it currently stands today. So I think it will continue to evolve and I think there will be an application down the road and maybe sooner than later, but we'll just have to wait and see. There is still a lot of issues with it, at this point and hopefully, it will get there, but it is just not there yet. Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Gantt for any additional or closing remarks. Greg Gantt : Okay, thank you all for participating today. We appreciate your questions. And please feel free to call us, if you have anything further. Thanks. And I hope you all have a great day. Operator : And once again that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir. Greg Gantt : Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions.  The OD team delivered strong financial and operating results for the third quarter despite a number of unusual operating challenges related to the effects of the pandemic. After experiencing one of our sharpest ever declines in volumes during the second quarter this year, a sequential increase in volumes during the third quarter was one of the strongest in our history. Through incredibly hard work and dedication, the OD team rose to the challenge and continued to deliver on-time service of 99% while matching our record low cargo claims ratio of 0.1%. We produced record profitability during the third quarter of 2020 by continuing to execute a simple operating plan, which we have described to you many times before. The long-term strategy is focused on delivering a value proposition of superior service at a fair price, which generally creates the capital for us to further invest in the capacity and technology that our customers demand to support their own initiatives. Superior service also goes beyond on-time and claims-free deliveries. Every member of the OD family understands the value of our service and how critical it is for supporting our yield management initiatives. Our long-term approach to managing yields on an account-by-account basis has strengthened the quality of our revenue and profitability over the long-term. We believe customers also appreciate our consistent pricing philosophy, which should continue to be a key factor in our ability to win market share over the long-term. With the pricing environment improving, and expectations for rates to rise further in our industry next year, we believe we are at an inflection point where market share wins can accelerate. While most people may look forward to turning the page on 2020, we will work tirelessly to finish this year out strong, and we'll also use the period to prepare for 2021. We believe the domestic economy and customer demand will continue to improve. So we must ensure that we have the necessary elements of capacity to support our anticipated growth. Given our long-term market share opportunities, we intend to steadily invest in equipment and additional service center capacity that should include the opening of several new facilities before the end of the first quarter next year. We will also continue to invest in our most critical asset, our OD family of employees. We are actively hiring additional drivers and platform employees to balance our workforce with growing demand and shipment trends, and we will continue to provide our team with the training, benefits and opportunities to succeed and support our customers. With our unique position in the market and ability to further invest in ourselves, I am confident in our ability to continue to grow profitably while increasing shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the third quarter of 2020 was $1.1 billion, which was a 0.9% increase from the prior year. We operated very efficiently during the quarter and established new company records for our operating ratio and overall profitability. Our operating ratio improved 480 basis points to 74.5% and earnings per diluted share increased 24.8% to $1.71. Our revenue growth for the third quarter may have been modest, but we were pleased to actually return to a positive trend. The increase reflects a 1.3% increase in LTL tonnage that was partially offset by the 0.6% decrease in LTL revenue per hundredweight. This yield metric as well as overall revenue was negatively affected by the significant decrease in the average price of diesel fuel as well as changes in the mix of our freight. Our underlying pricing trends remained relatively consistent during the third quarter, as indicated by the continued strength in our LTL revenue per shipment. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the third quarter increased 18.1% as compared to the second quarter of 2020, while LTL shipments per day increased 15.4%. Following the steep drop in volumes in April that generally resulted from the initial state-at-home orders, our shipment levels have steadily increased above our normal sequential trend. At this point, in October, with almost a week remaining in the month, our revenue per day is trending higher by approximately 2% to 2.5% as compared to October 2019. Our shipments per day trended in line with normal seasonality, but our weight per shipment is in the 1,570- to 1,600-pound range, which is lower than the third quarter.  While the weight per shipment is still higher on a year-over-year basis as compared to October 2019, the sequential decrease is due to measures we took to limit the number of heavier-weighted LTL shipments in our system as well as improving revenue trends with our smaller customer accounts that generally have a lower weight per shipment than a larger national account. As usual, we will provide the actual revenue related details for October in our third quarter Form 10-Q. Our third quarter operating ratio improved 480 basis points to 74.5%, with improvement in both our direct operating cost and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. We improved the efficiency of our operations and produced increases in our laden load average, P&D shipments per hour and platform shipments per hour when compared to the third quarter of 2019. While we will continue to add drivers and platform employees during the fourth quarter, as Greg mentioned, we believe we can effectively balance our labor-to-revenue trend in line with the normal sequential change in this expense line item by continuing to focus on productivity. We will also maintain our disciplined approach to control discretionary spending and make every effort to minimize cost inflation in other areas. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $170.2 million and $686.5 million for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2020, respectively, while capital expenditures were $46.3 million and $166.5 million for the same periods. We paid $17.6 million of cash dividends to our shareholders during the third quarter, and returned $360.3 million in total capital to shareholders during the first 9 months of the year. For the year-to-date period, this total includes $306.8 million of share repurchases and $53.5 million in cash dividends. There were effectively no share repurchases made during the third quarter due to the 6-month accelerated share repurchase agreement we executed in May. We recorded the initial delivery of shares in the second quarter, and the remaining unsettled shares will be delivered in the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020 was 24.8% as compared to 24.9% in the third quarter of 2019. Our rate in the third quarter benefited from certain discrete tax adjustments, and we currently expect our effective tax rate to be 25.9% for the fourth quarter of 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go first to Allison Landry with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Allison Landry : So Adam, you mentioned weight per shipment lower sequentially, still up a little bit year-over-year. I was just wondering, is there a weight per shipment that you're targeting to optimize the revenue quality and margins? And also, are you starting to see any spillover freight from tight truckload capacity? And is that -- are those some of the shipments that you're turning away? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I don't think that there's necessarily an optimal weight per shipment. Certainly, we've tended to average in better periods around the 1,600-pound mark, and we can trend down closer to 1,550 pounds, and that still be fine, too. Some of the lower watermarks like we hit in kind of August of last year, was about 1,530 pounds, that's generally when the economy may not be as strong and that kind of went hand-in-hand with some of the slowdown that we had seen in the industrial market last year. But we're still pleased. I mean, right now, it's kind of around -- between the 1,570- and 1,600-pound range, and that's good. We were starting to see some heavier weighted shipments coming in, particularly off the west coast, some really just large transactional business that we wanted to make sure we weren't getting overrun with and to try to keep the network in balance as well. So we took some internal measures there to try to limit, not necessarily exclude all, but to limit some of those shipments kind of around the system. And so that's why it's trending a little bit lower. In September, the average was 1,617 pounds, so it had been moving back closer to that 1,600-pound mark. And there's a couple of good trends in there. Our smaller mom-and-pop customers are starting to -- the revenue is coming back. Initially in the pandemic, we had stronger performance with our larger national accounts. Our top 50 accounts continue to perform very well. But starting to see some of those smaller accounts come back. And I think once we get at the election and some of the uncertainty that's out there, hopefully, we'll see those continue to trend even more favorably as we transition into '21. Allison Landry : Okay. And then I know you talked about the environment currently being conducive to accelerating market share gains, and it sounds like you're more active on the hiring front. But could you sort of walk us through how you expect headcount trends to materialize in Q4? It sounded like maybe up a little bit sequentially, but do you think it'll still be down year-over-year? Adam Satterfield : I think that it will -- typically, on a sequential basis, the average change in headcount in the fourth quarter is about 2% higher than the third quarter. And when you look back at some periods like 2017, for example, that number was about 4% higher sequentially. And we were going through a similar period then with volumes really starting to accelerate. So we certainly could see that number kind of being around that 4%. There's no magic number. We're basically just as we go around the system trying to figure out where we need people and to keep things balanced. We may have noticed that we used a little bit of purchase transportation, a little bit more than normal in the third quarter. That was up 20 or 30 basis points. And that's some of how we manage when you get a surge in shipments like we saw when we didn't have all the people in the right places. We can certainly go to that purchase transportation market. But with truckload rates like they are now, certainly, we want to -- we would rather have the employees and our own equipment and continue to manage our domestic line haul network 100% in-house like we historically have, and we only use that extra PT when absolutely necessary because that's where I think we get the advantage from a claims standpoint. By having that total control, we can control that service element to our business. And certainly, that's critical to our value proposition and being able to continue the trend of what we've produced historically. So we're going to make sure that we keep adding the people where necessary to keep up with current demand trends, but also for expectations for a positive growth environment in '21. So it's critical that we get all the people in place. We've certainly got the equipment, and we'll be addressing our equipment and our service center needs with our '21 CapEx plan. But that people piece of the equation right now is important. And given the effects of the pandemic, it's not something that you can solve quickly. It takes a little bit more time to process and onboard drivers, in particular. And so that's something that we just want to make sure that we can catch up and try to get ahead of the demand curve, if we will. Operator : We'll go next to Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Jordan Alliger : Just a couple of questions. Just following up on the driver headcount front. Obviously, in the truckload sector, they talk a lot about drivers being difficult to come by. I'm just curious, your experience in the LTL world on driver headcount. Greg Gantt : Jordan, great question. They are hard to come by. They're a little more difficult to find now than they have been in the past. But we're having success, as Adam mentioned. Since the pandemic, it's a little bit harder to onboard people than it used to be because of some of the issues and some of the government offices and that kind of thing. We're not getting records, checks back as timely as we're used to. Just some of the things that you do to process a driver are taking a little bit longer than we're used to, but we're able to find drivers. Again, just not always at the speed that we'd like to find them. But so far, so good, but it definitely takes an effort. We're still able to hire some competitors. And I think that's a good thing that certainly has helped us over time. So we'll continue to do what we need to do to keep our service center staffed and ready to go. Jordan Alliger : All right. That's helpful. And then just one other quick one. Can you touch a little bit more on some of these other -- the expense side, the operating supplies, general supplies, et cetera? I'll continue to track on the second quarter and now the third quarter at a very good run rate relative to normal as a percentage of sales, I'm just curious, is this -- are these sort of general supply, other OpEx expenses, can they stay muted? Or do they have to come back over time as well as the labor? Adam Satterfield : I think some of those, just collectively, when you talk about the general supplies and expenses and depreciation, those all kind of fall in the general overhead bucket, if you will. And that would include -- the other big component is a piece of the salary, wages and benefits, our salaried employees and clerical and so forth. But all of those dollars, that's been an area that we've talked about from the first to the second quarter.  We certainly saved on dollars in the aggregate due to active measures that we took. But sequentially, we had, from the first quarter to the second quarter, some inflation and those aggregate expenses as a percent of revenue. But with the improvement in revenue, we actually were able to generate some improvement there. So in the second quarter of this year, those costs in aggregate were about 24% of revenue. They were a little over 21% here in the third quarter. So the improvement in revenue certainly helped. The total dollars were about the same that we spent. And that's just ongoing cost control measures that we've got in place. Certainly, as we start transitioning into '21, it's kind of a matter of when some of those costs will return something such as some of our marketing programs, customer entertainment, travel by our sales personnel. We want to be able to restart those measures. Our sales team has done a phenomenal job having to play the hand that they're dealt right now. Staying in front of our customers, continuing to communicate, talk about customer challenges and customer opportunities as well. But certainly, it's not as effective when they're out making personal sales calls and having face-to-face meeting. So we'd like to see that be restored and happily would pay that cost, but that's one of those things that we simply have no idea when it will be safe to really be able to fully restore those programs. So measures like that will come back in due time. But certainly, we'd expect to have a much higher revenue base when those are restored as well. And we've historically seen our overhead costs kind of average between 20% to 25%. And coming back to being closer to 21% -- 21%, 21.5% of revenue here in the third quarter. Certainly, it's a function of cost control, some revenue recovery, but just continuing to be disciplined there and trying to keep those overhead costs as low as a percent of revenue as we can will always be our focus going forward. Operator : We'll go next to Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins : Congratulations on a great quarter here. So Adam, maybe if I could just kind of think about the third quarter to fourth quarter seasonality here. Typically, it's about 170 basis points or so of sequential deterioration. You talked about needing to staff up on the headcount side. Obviously, it's such an unusual year in terms of how this year has progressed. Do you think that we'll see something more in line with normal seasonality this year? Or given all these different factors here, should we think about it being one way or the other, maybe a little bit worse than normal seasonality or maybe a little bit better? Just can you kind of help us think through that for a moment? Adam Satterfield : Yes. Certainly, I think the way we'll be looking at it is we'll look at kind of that normal sequential trend. And then just sort of compare and contrast there. I think that with revenue trends that we think can continue, certainly not at the strength of the recovery and the surge we saw in the third quarter. But with positive revenue trends continuing, that certainly gives us a helping hand, if you will.  The average -- we've got several outliers when you just look at a simple 10- or 5-year average over time. But it's usually about a 200-basis-point increase. And the fourth quarter can include things like we have an annual actuarial assessment, and we rebase a couple of the insurance-type liabilities, and that can go one way or the other on us. And so when you throw out some of those outliers, I think that 200 basis point kind of change will be sort of what we measure against. But as you know, we're always looking to try to do better. And if we can outperform a little bit on a revenue basis, then certainly that will win to help in hand. I think that in the third quarter some of the costs that we saw will go away temporarily in the second. A big cost element was -- were things like our group health and dental costs. Those kind of restored to normal, and frankly, we're a little bit higher when we look at our fringe benefit rate as a percent of revenue. The group health and dental costs were a little bit higher than what that normal rate has been. And as a result, that fringe rate was a little bit higher than normal. So I think that there's some catch-up on some cost items. So there's some puts and takes going both ways, and we'll just look to try to balance those. But we did want to say that -- I said it in the prepared comments, that I think that the biggest cost element that we have is the salaries, wages and benefits. And certainly, we're going to continue to keep our focus, one, on providing the very best service in our industry. And I'm really proud of what we achieved, continuing to deliver in the third quarter with historic low, matching our cargo claims ratio at 0.1% and continue to deliver 99%. But I think that we can keep that 200 basis point change kind of about 150 basis points, is the typical change in that salaries, wages and benefit. So if we can manage that kind of in line with normal seasonality, and I think we can. Then certainly, some of those other cost elements will be more a function of revenue trends, if you will, from the third to the fourth quarter. Jack Atkins : Okay. Okay. Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And so I guess for my follow-up question here, I don't want to put you guys on the spot, but I've been getting this question this morning from some investors. But when you kind of think about the long-term goal has always been sort of a 25% incremental margin for your business, when we think about this quarter, in particular, you guys had, obviously, a 25.5% operating margin for the quarter. So it kind of feels like we're maybe pushing into a new frontier. Has there been any change to how you guys are thinking about the incremental margin potential of the business as we sort of look forward? Or is 25% still the right number to use? Adam Satterfield : I think what we've said maybe a couple of years ago was 25% was kind of our long-term goal. And that would imply working towards a 75% operating ratio. When we achieve that goal, then we'd kind of update the internal number, if you will. And that doesn't mean that we certainly can't do better than that in a quarterly period. And I think we certainly can, and we've proven it in the past.  And when you think about our cost structure, with sort of 2/3 or around there of our costs being variable. If we can continue to manage those variable costs and produce leverage on those fixed costs, then we can produce some really strong numbers. But until we achieve the 75% annual operating ratio, and I think we'll keep that goal out there. And then we'll update it and start thinking about sort of what's next. But what we feel is a lot of confidence on the ability to continue to improve the operating ratio even further. We know we've got opportunity of just continuing to execute on a basic plan. And to achieve long-term operating ratio improvement, it's a focus on density and yield. And certainly, the density piece of that has been a challenge this year. But when you look at some of our operating metrics, despite the significant changes from first to second and then second to third, we've met those challenges, operated very efficiently and been able to control our costs. So we've done all the things there. But that yield piece is critically important as well. And just having a long-term consistent approach that is focused on outperforming our cost inflation that's led to -- and helped us improve the operating ratio over the long-term. So there's certainly -- we feel confident saying that we can continue to beat it. We'll have some quarters where we might be 35% or even up to 40%. We've done some of those numbers in the past. And certainly, the cost structure has improved when you think about our direct cost as a percent of revenue. So that creates an even stronger opportunity for us as we move forward. But we're not going to let that be a limiting factor either. We don't necessarily focus on incremental margins internally. What we're focused on is producing long-term profitable growth. And so to achieve the market share opportunities that we think are out there in front of us, it requires investments and doing things that create some cost. And so we're going to continue to make all the necessary investments we need to make and try to continue the string of the long-term profitable growth we've been able to deliver because that ultimately leads to increased shareholder value. Operator : We'll go next to David Ross with Stifel. David Ross : Adam, I just want to talk a little bit more about, I guess, the employee side because the labor efficiencies is where you've shown the most leverage. 6 months ago, 10 months ago, you guys were already very lean. So I guess, where did you cut -- how did you -- how were you able to move the amount of freight that you're moving now with fewer people? What was -- what was the fact that you found that may not have been apparent? Greg Gantt : Dave, some of that fat was not necessarily in our productive labor, but in some of our supervision, clerical and the different areas, not just necessarily productive, drivers, dock and those folks. But we found some -- when things got really tight, we found some things that we were able to manage without, and we made the necessary -- what we felt like were necessary cuts at the time. We have not added all of those folks back by any means. Some things have changed, and we have not needed that additional labor that we were able to reduce back in the spring, back in April and May. So now we -- every location is a little bit different. The means are a little bit different by location. But now we do have some needs that we're continuing to feel to ramp back up just to make sure we're staffed. And as Adam had mentioned before, and as I mentioned in my earlier commentary, trying to prepare for '21, which we expect to be pretty robust and promising year. So we'll continue that ramp up as needed. David Ross : And Greg, you mentioned also investing in technology that customers demand to support their initiatives. Can you give us some examples of what that is? And has that also allowed you to be more productive from a labor efficiency standpoint? Greg Gantt : In some cases, David, it has. But for the most part, the biggest thing that customers are looking for is feedback on their shipments. They want to know where it is and how do they get it, how do they get it quicker. And those are the things that we continue to try to work on the communication, shipment communication, the feedback that we get from our customers, the information that we get back from them in order to provide quicker tracing and better information, better -- so they can better plan and so we can better plan. So it's a 2-way street from that standpoint. But we're continuing to focus and work on those things, and they are definitely starting to help us. Adam Satterfield : That's definitely helping. So thank you very much, David. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Christian Wetherbee : I was curious about the revenue per day cadence from September to October. I guess I'm trying to get a sense of -- you talked about weight per shipment a little bit in the fluctuation there. Maybe you get a sense of what's going on, on the pricing side or the revenue per hundredweight side to get a sense of how mix and kind of core pricing are impacting that as well? Greg Gantt : Yes. I mean, the yields are going to continue. Certainly, if you're looking at revenue per hundredweight with the shipment sizes, weight per shipment decreasing a little bit. That certainly would cause the revenue per hundredweight to increase slightly as well. So that's been a strong number, I think, when you look at the sequential increase in our yield metrics from the second to the third. Just looking at it on a hundredweight basis, I think that certainly some of the mix impacted things; the higher weight per shipment in the third, a little bit longer length of haul as well. That's certainly contributing. But that will continue. And we feel like some of the feedback we're hearing is that yields are continuing to increase in the industry as well. And a lot of times, what you'll see is, especially some of our competitors that use a little bit more purchase transportation and truckload services to run some of their internal line haul, certainly will start facing cost inflation when the truckload rates are inflecting as positive as they are right now. And that's typically a good thing that creates historically an inflection point where we start seeing really a higher need or a need rather for higher rates for our competitors that are offsetting those costs as their cost inflation is increasing. And so that's supportive of our ongoing yield initiatives internally as well as it usually will create some freight opportunity for us as well when that piece of cost for our competitors is increasing certainly much faster than what our cost inflation would look like. So those are a couple of good trends that we feel positive about as we start thinking about finishing out 2020 and then turning the page to '21. Christian Wetherbee : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And I guess you talked about inflection points in the prepared remarks and also in the answer to my question. So thinking about market share opportunities as maybe you sort of cross over into 2021, you guys have always done a good job growing in excess of the market. But can you give us maybe some bigger picture thoughts on sort of LTL industry growth opportunities and then what your opportunity is within that and maybe sort of frame it in the context of next year or the year after? Just want to get a sense of sort of how you're still seeing that opportunity, how big it is? Greg Gantt : Yes. When you look at that LTL, it has been growing faster than just general GDP. And we think that the industry overall will continue to see good growth. And I think that there are some longer-term tailwinds at play with things like, for example, the e-commerce trends that are pushing more retail-related freight into the system. And right now, we're seeing good trends with the retailers. And it's different to manage that type of freight than certainly some of the -- our legacy industrial-related business, which is still 55% to 60% of our revenue. But certainly, it's been nice to have a good mix of retail-related business that performed pretty strong for us, particularly in the second quarter when everything else was really weak. So that's a trend that I think will continue to be a tailwind for LTL, creating smaller shipment sizes as fulfillment centers continue to be built closer to population areas and shipment sizes more conducive to LTL versus truckload. But I think it gets back to -- right now, capacity may not be as big of a factor at least this year, going through some of the weakness that the overall market has seen. But when you get back to the long-term trend that we've been talking about before the pandemic effect, we've been consistently investing in real estate capacity, growing our network and building out the doors to process freight. And that's what's required in the LTL space, the door capacity is very critical and certainly could be a limiting factor to growth, and it's why we stay or try to stay so far ahead of the demand curve there. And there really hasn't been at least a significant change in the number of service centers and the other public carriers when you look over a longer period of time. Certainly, some have added to their systems and grown in different areas and whatnot. But nevertheless, I think we've been one of the biggest winners for market share in some cases because we continue to invest and have the capacity. So we have a service advantage by offering best-in-class service. We have a capacity advantage, and we think that will continue to play in our favor as the market continues to recover. We've certainly seen some improving trends. I think that some of our industrial customers will continue to improve. ISM and some things like that have certainly been positive the last couple of months. But I don't think we're anywhere near full recovery for most manufacturers and -- manufacturing type businesses, as they've not been as strong as some of our retailers. So those will -- those customers will continue to recover. I think we'll continue to see favorable trends with the retail-related business as well, and all that can kind of come together, hopefully, for us as we transition into '21. Operator : We'll go next to Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : So just maybe as a follow-up from that question. Can you just give us a sense into what your customer conversations are like right now? I mean, clearly, the LTL market is super tight. There's a long way to go in the demand cycle. Are your customers looking ahead to 2021? And are they panicking? Do you see kind of RFP contract negotiations coming forward? Kind of how are you thinking about the timing of the next GRI based on what your customers are you right now? Greg Gantt : Yes, Ravi, I'd expect that we would take our next increase pretty much annually like we typically do. Typically, it's a year out, and I would expect next spring that we would take our typical seasonal increase based on our cost and how they are trending, which we will look at closer to that time. But there has been, and I think we mentioned it earlier, there has been a lot of demand for the bigger shipments, particularly, as Adam mentioned, off the West Coast. We've seen that, which certainly changes how you respond to customers' needs and whatnot. We're not a truckload carrier. And if you're not careful, sometimes when the demand changes like it being this -- early this fall, when you start to see those things, you have to make some adjustments, which we did. So I think customers are certainly what we can tell, they're positive going into next year. Again, the pandemic, I think, has some impact on that. But as we continue to recover and hopefully positively so, I think we'll certainly go into '21 with big expectations, and certainly what we're aiming towards at this point. Ravi Shanker : Great. And just kind of on that, again, if you just give us a little bit of a framework on what big expectations mean. I mean, typically, your GRI is in the mid-single-digit range. Will you be pushing for double digits? Adam Satterfield : I think we've got a long-term approach, Ravi, that we look at our cost inflation every year. And then we sit across the table from our customers and talk about what our costs, how they're changing and then what we need in terms of rate. And certainly, the way we really manage the business is looking at customer profitability on an account-by-account basis. So there may be some customer accounts that we'll have to maybe be more aggressive with. And then there's other long-term customer accounts that may go into the equation that be a little bit lower than the average. So it just kind of depends on each customer situation, and we'll look at those. But we've been pretty consistent the last few years with a general rate increase of around 5%. And then that kind of becomes the proxy for what we talk to customers on average. About for the need, and we've been successful in achieving our contractual increases throughout this year. But that kind of gets back to the heart of the true customer relationship that you have. And our industry is a relationship business. And so it's critical that we continue to talk with our customers and have that 2-way open and honest communication about things. And certainly, we're willing to do that, and it makes more sense when you can have a cost-based discussion versus the industry is tight and we need a double-digit increase this year. And the industry is loose this year, so we're going to give you some of that back next year and the rollercoaster ride that maybe some customers go on with when they make a decision other than select an Old Dominion. But we're really proud of kind of these long-term customer relationships that we have, and certainly, we think that will continue. And next year, just looking out, certainly, that's kind of the 4% to 5%. When you look at our long-term revenue per shipment, we've kind of averaged really between 4.5% and 5%, and that's been 75 to 100 basis points above our cost per shipment inflation. And we've already established a 3% wage increase that went into effect the 1st of September. So that's a big element of our cost inflation every year. And has been pretty consistent as well. So we already know some of those factors, and that'll kind of frame things up for us. But we'll look. And the yield numbers themselves, some of it will really depend. There's going to be some weird comparisons as we transition into next year with weight per shipment that might make your revenue per hundredweight look a little bit stronger than maybe that 5% type of number. So we'll just have to balance all of those. But underlying contract and general rate increase, I would expect that we'll see it kind of consistent with what our long-term trends have been. Ravi Shanker : That's great color. If I can just sneak in 1 follow-up to that. Kind of the 1 area, which I think you may not have mentioned is fuel. Obviously, kind of we appear to be in an environment of like prolonged subdued fuel prices. And in the past, the fuel surcharge has been a nice boost to your yield metrics. Do you feel like you need to change your go-to-market strategy or maybe change some of the formulas and how the fuel yield -- the fuel surcharge is calculated there? Adam Satterfield : Well, we've been dealing with fuel that's been down 20% or more. And that's what it was down in this most recent quarter, and we produced a 74.5% operating ratio. So I think when we balance that fuel contribution with the overall yield, that's just a variable component of pricing. And it's something that we continue to look at. And as a contract turns over, we look at the fuel base. But I think that we've been pretty successful with our fuel strategy really over the last couple of years. It's been several years ago, where when fuel first really took a big drop that maybe the low end of our scale wasn't appropriate, and we waited a little time to go back to some of our customers and have to make some changes on that. So as long as fuel continues to stay consistent, it doesn't really go much lower, we'd like to see it come back a little bit because that certainly helps the top line number. But we're going to be -- if fuel continues to stay in this range where it is, around $2.40 a gallon, that's -- it's going to be down in the fourth quarter. That would be down in the first quarter and really be the second quarter of next year before it kind of comes back to par, that was when fuel started dropping in 2Q of this year. So we'll see. It'd be nice if it was a little bit higher because certainly that optically make our revenue numbers. When we come in every day and we look at what the revenue from the previous day was, and when we look at the revenue, we can say growth now. But looking at it with and without the fuel, without the fuel certainly looks much stronger, and it'd be nice if that was the overall number, but you play the hand that you're dealt, and that's what we'll continue to do. Greg Gantt : Positive side of that, Ravi, is obviously, we don't need high fuel prices to produce a record low OR. So I think that's the positive side of that. Operator : We'll go next to Jason Seidl with Cowen. Jason Seidl : Quickly when you look at the surge in freight that we've seen that came on in the summer, what are your customers telling you in terms of where it's coming from? I mean, clearly, there's been some restocking, but there is some underlying demand. I'm just curious what they're saying. How strong is this going to be and for how long? Adam Satterfield : Certainly, when you look at inventory levels overall, they continue to be low and so I think that some of that will continue, but the consumer continues to consume. And I think that people are spending money in different ways. And you get down to it, that's still 70% to 80% of the overall economy. So as people continue to purchase things and there's got to be the production of those things and ultimate delivery and positioning for them to be able to buy them. So certainly, there's been some obvious changes in the retail landscape related to the pandemic and probably have seen e-commerce growth probably pulled forward a couple of years at least in terms of the change of e-commerce in terms of total retail sales. So that's been something that, as we talked about before, it creates some opportunity for the LTL industry. That's certainly not an overnight kind of phenomenon, and you don't build fulfillment centers overnight, but that's something that's certainly continuing to change, and we think we can benefit from. And we're going to do everything we can to make sure. But hinted at earlier, there's certainly some operational challenges that come along with managing more that freight and balancing, you're right, equipment pools and just the service demands can be different as well. So we've got to make sure that we keep all of that balanced as we flex and see more growth with our retail-related business. But I think that certainly, we can see those trends continue and take advantage because the other big piece of that retail-related growth on the e-commerce side is the demand for superior service is even greater. As they're managing inventory levels, and inventory is tight, then certainly you can't afford to. And in many cases, when you deliver into many of the big-box retailers that have got programs in place that that will have penalties for vendors if their carriers aren't delivering on time and in full. Certainly, when you make the selection of choose an Old Dominion, we're going to deliver on time 99% of the time and our damages as a percent of revenue of 0.1%. So we certainly can meet that demand and service expectation for our customers and help them avoid charges down the line where the total cost of service is cheaper for them, even though they might pay a little bit more upfront for Old Dominion. Jason Seidl : That's good color. I have a follow-up on technology. I mean, you guys have always been at the forefront investing in technology, going back in my 20-plus years of covering you. How should we look at Old Dominion in their foray into potential alternative fuel-type or alternative-technology trucks? Is this something you're looking at? Greg Gantt : Certainly, Jason. We always try to stay in the forefront of any type of new equipment that's out there. I think we've talked about this in one of the prior calls, but we're looking at and exploring electric vehicles and that kind of thing. But Jason, honestly, right now, nobody has a production, any type of a production of electric vehicle. They're just -- we're just not there yet. I'm sure they've come a time, and we'll progress as the technology and the opportunities for that progress. But right now, they're just not out there and available. So we certainly have to balance all that from a cost standpoint and everything else. But they're -- I'm sure that's going to be a big thing as we go forward. But right now, they're just not production vehicles out there to be had to run in our system. There's lots of issues, lots of poles left to climb, if you will. And again, I'm sure we'll get there, but just not there yet. Jason Seidl : So it feels like we're a couple of years away then? Greg Gantt : I think so. Operator : We'll go next to Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Adam, on your comments regarding the cost structure, especially on the overhead side, I guess that implies direct costs or variable costs of 53% to 53.5% of revenues. Do you think you can hold the line on that, I guess, variable piece of the cost structure in 4Q in terms of percentage of revenue? Or is there anything that may drive, I guess, a bit of the match between how that's evolved versus shipments has actually been quite close. I'm just wondering if there's any perspective mismatch there between variable costs and shipments that we should think about as you go into the fourth quarter? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I mean, that's the -- we were talking earlier about some of the labor costs and that salary, wages and benefits line. It's typically where that normal sequential deterioration in the operating ratio that's about 200 basis points. The majority of that comes from the salary, wages and benefits line. And most of those costs are going to be our productive labor cost. So we'll see how that balances as we transition. Typically, like I said, you'd see that inflate a little bit, and we're certainly going to do what we can and believe that we can keep those costs kind of in line with what that normal sequential trend will be. And some of it will just depend on kind of what the revenue base and how that trends through the fourth quarter compared to where we just were in the third. So -- but that will have more of an impact really on some of those more fixed types of costs. Amit Mehrotra : Yes. And then just related to that, I guess, on the overhead side, I'd love for you to comment on the long-term opportunity there. Obviously, there's excess capacity on the line haul network and the density opportunities there. I mean, in 3, 4, 5 years, assuming no major change, I guess, in the growth and how the mix of revenue is trending. Could we be looking at 17% to 18% overhead, just as you guys continue to leverage the line haul? And then the last one I had is just -- if you could just provide a little bit more color around September tonnage. That's obviously important between the breakdown between shipments and weight per shipment on a year-over-year basis. I don't know if you can help us with that in terms of how the quarter ended in September. Adam Satterfield : Yes. In terms of the long-term where overhead costs might go, we've just -- over the long run, we've seen those costs trend between that 20% to 25% type of range. And the reason for that is really what our market share opportunities are for the long-term. And we feel like we've got a really long runway for continued growth there, which will require continued investment in assets. And so as we continue to invest, certainly, that depreciation line will continue to stay more as a bigger component, if you will, versus getting to the point where there's not growth left, and you can create leverage on that. So we feel good about what the market share opportunities are and continuing to look at investing 10% to 15% of our revenues back into our CapEx programs every year that that will then drive the increase in depreciation. Some of those overhead costs, too, are more variable in nature. There are some elements that are bad debt expense. There's some performance-based compensation that's in there. There's other things that are more variable. So that 20% to 25%, maybe 5% to 8% of revenue is kind of more variable in nature that that's sort of within that overall element. So those will obviously continue to increase. But certainly, there's going to be opportunities out there. And we certainly are always looking to do what we can to minimize those costs. But what that means over the long run is that the improvement in the operating ratio has come out of our direct cost. And you referenced line haul a couple of times, and we put line haul, that's a direct operating expense. And there's a fixed nature of running our line haul operations. And when we add new service centers, sometimes that creates a little inefficiency on the line haul side, but it drives efficiency within our pickup/delivery operations because we're now putting our pickup/delivery workforce, if you will, closer to our customers and minimizing the time to our first stop. And so there's different trade-offs as we continue to grow and add to the overall footprint. But I think that certainly, there's opportunities for us to continue to be efficient there and drive further efficiencies. When you sort of break down our operations, we're at about 240 service centers now. When you look at the available capacity that we have in the network, that's the opportunity, whereas we increase density in one particular service center, that helps that service center's operating ratio. And when you're doing that across the spectrum of those 240, it's only the few that you're adding depreciation to every year where you're causing the operating ratio maybe to go the opposite direction. But you've got a bigger pool that they're working on some type of improvement program. And that's really at the heart of why we've got confidence in saying we can continue to drive the operating ratio even lower than where it is today. Amit Mehrotra : Can you address the September question as well on the breakdown between shipment, weight per shipment and shipments? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I thought with that long-winded response, you might forget about that one, but with September, let's see, so the overall -- do you want the year-over-year for September? Amit Mehrotra : Yes, if you're going to give me both, I'll take the year-over-year and sequential, that would be great. Adam Satterfield : Okay. So for weight, year-over-year tonnage was up 3.6%. And then sequentially, September's tonnage was up 4.3% over August. On the shipment side, the shipments per day were down 0.5% on a year-over-year basis. So compared to September of last year, shipments in September on a sequential basis were up 4.6% versus August. Operator : We'll go next to Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Fowler : Adam, just on the comments around the network growth into '21. I guess, first to start, can you share roughly where you think the available capacity is in the network? And then second, as you think about what you're targeting, is it mostly on the door side? Or is it on rolling stock? And is there anything we need to think about on the cost side? I think it was 2018 maybe where you grew the fleet a little bit in advance of the tonnage growth and the depreciation was out a little bit ahead. Is the thought in '21 that you could see a similar dynamic? Or would it be maybe a little bit better matched with the tonnage coming into the network? Adam Satterfield : Yes. The overall capacity of the service in a network is probably between 25% and 30% now. We've gotten above that 30% threshold when things really weakened. And I think we're kind of back in that type of range now, which is good for us, especially as we transition to next year. But as Greg mentioned earlier, we've got several facilities that we think will be opening just between now and the end of the first quarter. So I think that we'll see some openings in '21, but there will also be some facilities that we either just expand or we move into a larger facility and out of another one. Much of the investment will be continuing to add out in some of our larger metro areas where we may add a second, third, fourth or fifth facility. I think that there's tremendous market share opportunity there. We've seen that play out in the Midwest, in particular, which is the largest LTL market. And so I think that certainly, we've got opportunities there. And then we'll continue to look at where we have density for end of the line type of locations and can add a facility in a market that -- just like I was talking about earlier, that can help us in reducing some of our pickup/delivery cost as well just by getting out closer to our customers. But we generally want to make sure that there's enough freight opportunity and density there to support an operation in the market. On the other side and the other pieces, certainly, we've got equipment capacity right now. I think that we haven't finalized our CapEx. We'll give that on next quarter's call. But we had a bit of a holiday this year because of the overinvestment in equipment in '18 and '19. This year, we only spent $20 million on equipment. So I think that we'll see that number kind of get back to more of a normalized type of range, and we expect to see the overall CapEx kind of back in that 10% to 15% range, but probably towards the upper end of that.  But we've still got some things to finalize as we kind of transition through the fourth quarter and really get to the point of putting orders in place. But with all that said, I think that typically, we can create, and especially if we get into a really strong revenue growth environment, we can create leverage there and be able to offset those costs. And that kind of just goes back into maybe the incremental margin conversation we were having earlier. We certainly, I think, can produce some strong incrementals, but a lot of it will be dependent on the good expectations for next year. And we're still having conversations with customers as we're building up our forecast for next year and from a bottoms-up and a top-down basis. And there's still some uncertainty, obviously, hanging out there that we'll see it may change some people's minds next week based on the results of the election. Todd Fowler : Yes. Well definitely in Ohio we're seeing tuned on that one. That's for sure. So, just on my follow-up, I guess, kind of a bigger picture question, and Jack kind of hit on this with the incremental margin question earlier. But operating at a sub-75% OR here in the third quarter, are there any bigger picture takeaways as you think about the business? I mean you did it in an environment that was pretty volatile. You had purchase transportation that moved up. Tonnage was obviously up a lot sequentially, but not a lot year-over-year. Does it feel like that on a longer-term basis, it's sustainable to operate on a full-year basis at a mid-75 -- or excuse me, mid-70 OR? Or are there other pieces or other things that we need to think about that really contributed to this performance in the quarter that may not be representative of kind of what you can do longer-term? Adam Satterfield : Well, I think we've talked about being able to operate in this type of range on an annualized basis for some time and certainly made a lot of progress this year. Used to kind of say we needed revenue growth to be able to improve the operating ratio, but this environment was so unusual. We had to take immediate and aggressive action to address some of the cost because of how immediate the drop-off in revenue was and just the unavailability of work that was out there back in April. And so it's been good as we transitioned through and saw some of the recovery began back in May when things sort of stabilized and started improving. And we brought back probably about 1,400 employees compared back to April. And so we continue to onboard people to keep up with these demand trends. And -- but have really done a good job in balancing all of our costs. And I think what we've seen in the past in trying to take that forward, as we move into the future, is a lot of times, when you go through a period like this, you do a lot of evaluation of your processes, your people and systems and so forth. And some of the productivity that we saw improvements that we made back in the '08 and '09 timeframe, those carried forward for years to come. And so we certainly expect that some of this improvement in productivity as we transition back into a growth environment and start bringing newer people onboard, we obviously want to maintain these measurements of productivity. And I think that we'll be able to. And so certainly, that's encouraging. That's the biggest piece of the cost structure and the most critical element for us to continue to manage those and other true controllable costs as we transition back into more of a normalized growth environment in terms of what our expectations have been and what we've been able to produce in the past. So we certainly -- again, we've talked about it before, but we believe we can continue to improve the operating ratio. And it's just based on how that model works. If we can continue to improve the network density that generally creates productivity opportunities. And if we continue to be disciplined and have a cost-based type of approach to managing our yields, both of those generally require the positive macro environment to support those initiatives. We've done it when the macro environment wasn't good. But certainly, we think as we transition to more of a positive one, they'll continue to help on those fronts, and we can produce further operating ratio improvement. Operator : We'll go next to Ari Rosa with Bank of America. Ari Rosa : Nice quarter. So my first question, I wanted to talk about -- Greg, you mentioned you think we're at an inflection point on where OD can go in terms of market share. Maybe you could just elaborate on that a little bit. I think Adam talked earlier about some of your competitors seeing some cost pressures rising. But is it really a function of that? Or is it really a function more of kind of what you're seeing in terms of end markets and the conversations you're having with customers? And if so, maybe you could elaborate on where you're seeing some strength in terms of those customer conversations. And then if we think about other periods where OD has really seen a strong operating environment, you've been able to grow tonnage into the double digits. And so maybe you could talk about the extent to which you think that's feasible for 2021, given kind of where you are in terms of resources and what you're looking to add? Greg Gantt : Sure. Well, I think, obviously, we're expecting growth next year. We're continuing to -- as Adam had mentioned before, we're continuing to expand our capacity, both from a facilities and an equipment standpoint, and we're in the process of hiring people. So as you know, those are the components of adding capacity. So we're actually working pretty hard on all 3 fronts at this point in time. But we've seen strength of late, particularly off the West Coast. And I think we've all seen and heard about additional imports that are coming in and how busy the ports are out in that part of the country. And we've seen that particularly out of California. But we've exhibited strength really, for the most part, system-wide, and we certainly expect that next year. For the most part, our customers are extremely positive. Again, Adam mentioned before, what happens next week certainly could have an impact on where we are and where we go. But so far, we're expecting a good year. Obviously, we're spending money like we're expecting a good year. So I think we certainly hope that it continues down that path and we're -- just based on the feedback that we're getting, we're hoping for big things, to hope that makes sense. Ari Rosa : No, that's -- no, absolutely. That's helpful directionally, certainly. And then just a little bit on minutiae. But the free cash flow number, it looked like the cash from operating activities at about $170 million was a bit below what it has been typically. And so obviously, very strong on the income statement line. But maybe you could talk about what was going on there with the operating cash flow? Adam Satterfield : Yes, operating cash flow. Well, you've always got some changes in things that maybe are deferred that get paid. But when I think when you look on an overall basis, from a year-to-date standpoint, we produced really solid cash flow from operations. And so I've been pleased with that. But from a quarterly standpoint, could just be the timing effect of some of the deferred taxes that are somewhat related to the CARES Act from -- that was passed earlier this year that helped from some of the payroll taxes and whatnot.  And just some other changes in the timing effect of things. But really strong, I think, cash flow performance, if you will, in terms of kind of where we are. It's probably a little below on a year-to-date basis last year, but overall, it's approaching $700 million of cash from ops this year. So really strong, and we'll continue -- we've got it kind of in-hand to be able to put to work as we think about our CapEx. And as you know, our first priority for capital allocation is investing in our sales, and that the CapEx plan was a little bit lower this year. But a big piece of that was the equipment, as we talked about earlier. So we'll be evaluating that, as we transition next year, but it certainly will probably be a much larger number for CapEx than what we had this year. Operator : We'll go next to Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : A couple of quick ones. The -- so the October rev per day deceleration, is that entirely weight per shipment? Or is there any other piece of that? Adam Satterfield : No, it's weight per shipment driven, Scott. Like we mentioned before, the shipments are trending in line in October, and as you know, typically, our business kind of builds up and September is usually the strongest month of the year for us. And so, we saw that again, and those shipments continue to be really strong there. In fact, we're back to about kind of where when we put our forecast together for the beginning of the year back to where we thought we'd be in September but took an unusual route to get there. And you compare September shipment level to March, which is really before things begin to really be affected by the pandemic. We're kind of in line with the normal trend there of kind of you look back over time, where September would be versus March. So we're seeing good trends there. But the October, the shipments per day right in line right now at this point with what the longer-term -- the 10-year average sequential trend would be and -- but just a little bit softer on the weight per shipment side, which is not totally unexpected. We believe that, that would continue to sort of come back as our smaller customers continue to sort of get back to their normalized level. The mix is still slanted a little bit heavier to our larger national accounts than kind of historical trends by a couple of points probably. But nevertheless, those smaller accounts are continuing to perform well and coming back. So that's certainly beneficial. But yield trends continue to be solid, and it's really just a function of that weight per shipment is dropping a little bit on us. But some of that, like we mentioned, was us taking control and getting some of the transactional freight out of our business right now. Scott Group : But just given your views around share gains, you wouldn't have thought that shipments would be outperforming seasonality now? Adam Satterfield : Well, again, I think that when you just look and think about from a customer standpoint and how they're getting freight out, September is going to be the build-up. And when you look over the past 20 years, a normal sequential trend is down about 3%. There's really been only one October in the past 20 years that's been positive versus September. So obviously, we've got a week left in the month, and we're just talking about numbers that aren't finalized, but this is about where, frankly, we thought we would be, and we're managing to. So it's not been a surprise, especially with the fact that, again, we have limited some shipments out of the system. So it would have been slightly better, but very normal and expected to see, even as things were building up that we'd see a little bit of a drop-off in October versus the September trend there. And that's just really a function when you look across the spectrum of all of our customer accounts, the way they're managing their business and their shipment trends and so forth. So not unexpected to see it at all. Scott Group : Okay. And then just lastly, on the OR. So if you look at most years, the OR is similar with, if not better than, third quarter the prior year. So I guess what I'm trying to say is, it feels like next year should be a year where you can get to that 75% OR, if not better. Do you think we're missing anything there? Adam Satterfield : Well, I mean, we're not ready to call next year's operating ratio. But I think that certainly, if revenue plays out like we hope it will, transitioning then that obviously creates an opportunity. We generally, on average, have been produced or improving the operating ratio, 80 to 100 basis points kind of on average each year. And just taking kind of where we are from a year-to-date basis, then obviously we're a little bit better than that at this point than that longer-term trend despite the fact that revenues have been affected like they hadn't been. So we'll see where we end up next year, but we're not ready to give any specific color on it. But certainly, in an improving revenue environment, it makes the ability to improve operating ratio easier than certainly what we've seen and had to deal with this year. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Greg Gantt for closing remarks. Greg Gantt : Thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions. And please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and have a great day.

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference call over to the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead sir. Greg Gantt : Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion had a strong fourth quarter that included an increase in revenue and improvement in our operating ratio to 76.3%, which was a new fourth quarter company record. This combination led to the 34.2% increase in our earnings per diluted share. For the year, we also produced a company record operating ratio of 77.4% as well as an 11.4% increase in earnings per diluted share. While I am really proud of these financial results, I am more proud of the OD family of employees who work through tough conditions in 2020 to generate this success. Despite the operating challenges created by the pandemic and rapid changes in volumes, our team established a new record for our cargo claims ratio at 0.1%, while on-time service continued at 99%. These factors contributed to us winning the Mastio Quality Award for the 11th straight year. Our team is committed to delivering superior service at a fair price regardless of the circumstances, which is why we have often stated that the investment in our OD family is the most important investment we can make. This includes many things such as strong pay and benefits packages as well as training programs and advancement opportunities. In addition to our non-executive employees, their contributions during the pandemic we made special bonus payments in March and December 2020 that together totaled approximately $20 million. These factors as well as a strong family culture have allowed us to consistently attract and retain talented employees to support our growth initiatives. This is important as we intend to add to our OD family in 2021 by hiring additional employees to further increase the capacity of our workforce. With the demand improvement, environment improving we also intend to add the capacity of both our service center network and our fleet in 2021. After opening eight new facilities in 2020 and one more in January of this year, we are currently operating 245 service centers and have approximately 30% of excess capacity within the network to support additional growth. We plan to open two to three additional locations in the first quarter with several more during the remainder of the year. We believe these additional service centers as well as the expansion of some existing facilities will increase the overall average capacity within our network to ensure that is not a limiting factor to growth over the next few years. While we acknowledged that certain uncertainties with the domestic economy may continue we believe that Old Dominion is uniquely positioned to win additional market share in 2021. We also believe we can drive our operating ratio even lower than the 77.4% record that we established in 2020. We have long-maintained that the key components for long-term improvement in our operating ratio our improvements in both density and yield, both of which generally require a favorable macro environment. Our current trends indicate that we can improve on both of these measures in 2021 by remaining fully committed to the core business strategies that put us in our strong competitive position. Disciplined execution of our long-term strategic plan over the course of many years has differentiated us from our competition, while also creating long-term record of profitable growth. We are encouraged by our recent revenue trend and believe that we can take advantage of the momentum in our business to increase our earnings and shareholder value in 2021. Thanks for joining us this morning and now Adam will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you Greg and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $1.1 billion which was a 6% increase from the prior year. Our operating ratio improved 500 basis points to 76.3% and earnings per diluted share increased to $1.61. These results include $9.6 million of expense related to the special bonus paid to non-executive employees in December. We were pleased to see the improvement in our revenue growth which included increases in both volumes and yield. The increase in revenue included a 4.9% increase in LTL tonnage and a 1.1% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Excluding fuel surcharges, our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased by 4.2%. The growth in this metric was slightly more consistent with our longer-term average than recent quarters as our business mix continue to normalize, while underlying pricing trends have remained relatively consistent. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the fourth quarter increased 4.7% as compared to the third quarter of 2020, while LTL shipments per day increased 1.7%. These are both above our normal sequential trends and reflect the continued recovery from the initial drop in revenue in April that was related to the pandemic. For January our revenue per day increased 14.6% as compared to January of 2020. This reflects an 11.9% increase in LTL tons per day, an 2.2% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Our fourth quarter operating ratio improved to 76.3% and once again included improvements in both our direct operating cost and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. When compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 we generally improved the efficiency of our operations with increases in our laden-load average and P&D shipments per hour. We did however lose a little productivity with our platform shipments per hour that was mainly due to the number of new employees hired in the fourth quarter. As our volume trends continue to improve we intend to add drivers and platform employees during the fourth -- first quarter. We also expect to continue to use purchased transportation to supplement our workforce until the capacity of our team can fully support our anticipated growth. We improved our overhead cost as a percent of revenue during the fourth quarter by successfully leveraging our revenue growth and maintaining our discipline with discretionary spending. We will continue to control the discretionary spending in 2021 as we always do, but we anticipate that certain costs that were reduced in 2020 either directly or indirectly due to the pandemic will eventually be restored. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $246.6 million and $933 million for the fourth quarter and 2020 respectively, while capital expenditures were $58.6 million and $225.1 million for the same periods. Based on anticipated growth and the execution of our equipment replacement cycle, our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $605 million in 2020. This total includes $275 million to expand the capacity of our service center network although we would increase this amount further if we identify additional properties that fit into our long-term strategic plan. We returned $74.8 million of capital to shareholders during the fourth quarter and $435.1 million for the year. For 2020 this total included $364.1 million of share repurchases and $71 million in cash dividends. We were pleased that our Board of Directors approved a 33.3% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share in the first quarter of 2021. Since we began this program in 2017 and after giving effect to the company' s 3 :2 stock split in March of 2020 we have increased our dividend in excess of 30% each year. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter 2020 was 25.1% as compared to 24% in the fourth quarter of 2019. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be 26% for 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Fowler : Great. Thanks and good morning. Adam, I wasn't going to start with this, but you threw me off. Maybe you can provide a little bit more color on the strength that you're seeing in January the 11.9% increase in tons per day was stronger than what you looked in your trending in December. So if you had any color -- if you have any color on what you think is driving the strength in January that would be great? Adam Satterfield : Yeah. I think it's a couple of things, Todd. I mean, we certainly, really going back to April of 2020. Once we took that initial drop, business has just been accelerating since, generally speaking. And I think it began with customers reopening their businesses in different regions around the country getting healthier, and it just sort of accelerated from that point forward and that acceleration continued through the fourth quarter for us and into January as well. I think there is a lot of macro trends that are a favorable for our industry and certainly we're in an enviable position I think to take advantage of these changing trends. This is the type of environment I think, when our model usually shines the brightest. We're in a great spot with respect to the capacity of our service center network. Our fleet is in good shape, and we've talked about the fact that we're going to continue to hire new employees and we've continued to be successful in that endeavor in January as well. And we're also able to use a little purchased transportation to supplement as needed. But, our customers are getting healthier, business trends in general are improving and you're seeing the advantage of our business model just coming through for us, and we're able to take advantage of all of those improving trends and show a little growth which it's been a long time since we've been able to see growth like this. But certainly, when we start growing, we want to make sure it's profitable growth, and I think that we're in a good spot right now, and look forward to seeing this continue to play out in 2021. Todd Fowler : Okay. No, that sounds good. And then, maybe if you can just give a little bit more color -- you did a good job of continuing to leverage, shipment count growing faster than the headcount growth in the fourth quarter. Obviously in the prepared comments, you're talking about adding head counts. Can you give us a sense of kind of the trends maybe what you're expecting for sequential headcount growth in the first quarter, in the first half and how long you'd expect to continue to be able to increase the shipment count ahead of the headcount growth? Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Well, as you know, over the long-term, the change in our headcount pretty much matches the change in our shipment counts as well, and certainly in a short-term period they're not always in balance, but that is something that we've seen over the long-term. Right now and really again kind of going back to the middle part of last year when we made resource adjustments, we pretty much have been trying to play catch-up if you will, and our team has been working incredibly hard in operations to keep up and to continue to service and produce essentially record service metrics for us. So we've been really proud of that, but the team has been working incredibly hard. We have been using increased purchased transportation. If you noticed that increased to 3.1% in the fourth quarter and typically for us is around 2.2%, because we like to have 100% of our line-haul network in-sourced and using our people and our equipment, but we had -- have had to supplement a little bit and until we can really completely staffed up to where we want to be. Typically headcount in the first quarter is kind of flattish on average with the fourth quarter. Todd Fowler : Yeah. Adam Satterfield : And based on what we've been able to achieve thus far in January, I think that the maximum sequential change we've ever seen was in 1Q of 2018 where we had about a 3% increase over 4Q. I think we can be in that range and probably even higher, but effectively we've just got to catch back up so we can continue to serve our customers and be able to first reduce our reliance on purchased transportation, and then just try to get ahead of the curve, if you will, to face whatever volumes come our way for both 2021 as well as 2022. Todd Fowler : Okay, got it. That makes sense. I'll turn it over. Thanks for the time this morning. Operator : Next we'll go to Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins : Great, thank you. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I guess Adam, when we think about the sequential progression here if you kind of back out that special bonus payment there in the fourth quarter about a 75.4 OR. When you think about tonnage in January being better than normal seasonality, again, it's early in the quarter. How are you thinking about the potential, given your headcount comments there to Todd's question, the ability to sort of leverage that tonnage with sequential OR relative to normal seasonal pattern, which I think is typically 100 to 150 basis points degradation from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. So, if you think about that base number of 75.4, given those headcount comments and some of the other items down the P&L, how are you thinking about sequential change, given what's happening on the tonnage front? Adam Satterfield : Sure. You're right. The first quarter is typically 100 to 150 basis points of degradation from the fourth quarter. The special bonus that was in the fourth quarter, that's certainly something that I know you all will probably be adjusting, but that's not the only thing, that's one big thing that was called out, but you can see some other items, like our insurance and claims for example, that was a little bit lower than what the normal trend is. So, we anticipate that that will increase back to where we normally see it which is around 1% to 1.2% of revenue, and like many other carriers, we're going to be facing some increased inflationary costs, and that -- with our insurance premiums and so forth this year, just like we've faced the last couple of years. So, there's going to be some sort of puts and takes to it. General supplies and expenses is another one that I think will be stepping up. We referenced in our prepared remarks that certainly there is going to be some costs that will be restored this year and some of those will be some of our marketing and advertising programs. We're not at the point where our sales team can get out and travel around and do some things, so we still anticipate for the foreseeable future with some savings related to travel and customer entertainment, but certainly, intent to restore some of those expenditures. So, while they may not go back to where that cost had been between 3% and 3.5%, certainly anticipate them being higher than where we were in the fourth quarter. So, there is going to be some puts and takes. And we don't give guidance on the operating ratio, but we always use that normal sequential trend as a benchmark to measure ourselves against, and I think on the salary, wages and benefits line, when we talked about on the last quarter call, going from third quarter to fourth quarter, we wanted to try to keep the change in those costs and we felt like we could keep them in line with what our long-term trends are based on productivity, and the fact that we felt like revenue was improving well. Have a nice revenue growth on a sequential basis certainly gives you a lot of cover on some of those other more fixed type expense elements and I think we saw that leverage in us being enable to take advantage of that strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter to do just that. We create leverage from it. We kept the change in salaries, wages and benefits in line there. And so, I think certainly, that will give us leverage when we go from 4Q into 1Q as well to be able to keep those -- the salary cost, if you will, in line even though we will be bringing on and adding new people. So, there'll be puts and takes in different line items, but that sort of 100 basis point mark I think will be a good benchmark and we'll just see how we perform from there. Jack Atkins : Okay, no, that makes sense and thank you for all that color. I guess for my follow-up question, maybe kind of a bigger picture question for you, Greg. When you look back over, just the broader LTL market over the last, call it 10 to 15 years, there really hasn't been a lot of underlying market growth. The Old Dominion has done a great job taking a lot of market share as you guys have been investing in your business and investing in service. As you look out over the next three, five, seven years, Greg, I mean do you see the market growth accelerating for the LTL industry, and I'm thinking specifically about e-commerce and the middle mile impact that e-commerce is having across the transportation sector. I would just be curious to get your thoughts on sort of where you see the broader industry going. Obviously, OD is going to expect to continue to take market share, but would appreciate your thoughts there? Greg Gantt : I would hope we would see some growth in our -- in the LTL -- on the LTL side. I think some of the e-commerce trends and whatnot that we've seen are somewhat positive for LTL. The fact that all the Amazons of the world and many others have open so many distribution facilities all across the country and have actually gotten closer to customers. So, you hope that some of the suppliers then are shipping to all these different type facilities and that lends itself to LTL versus truckload when you're talking about smaller quantities getting in customers' hands quicker. So, I think that's a positive trend from an e-commerce standpoint, certainly. I think that just the broader macro economy will be the telltale. How does it do? I don't think we've really had a huge boom and certainly not in the last couple of years, maybe back to 2018, but not in the last two, so I think the macro certainly will drive our market as well as truckload in some of the small packages. So, let's hope that there is certainly strength from that standpoint. But I think it's positive. I'm not expecting a boom certainly compared to -- over the last 10 years, but I think it will be certainly steady and we do expect some continued growth, certainly. Jack Atkins : Okay. Great. Thanks for the time. Operator : Next, we'll go to Jason Seidl with Cowen. Jason Seidl : Thanks operator. Gentlemen, good morning, hope everyone is well. Wanted to talk a little bit about contract pricing, could you tell us or give us an idea of, how that went in the quarter? And then, sort of, what do you expect going forward, now that UPS Freight has been purchased by TFI, considering there have been more of a, discounter in the marketplace? And then, I have a follow-up. Adam Satterfield : Yeah. We don't necessarily detail out, what our contractual business is done versus our tariff-related business. But I think that, generally speaking, we've had a pricing philosophy that's been cost-based. And we expect each customer to give us pricing that's above those costs to support the investments we make in service and capacity and technology. And that's worked out well for us. We -- I think, we had success last year. And it was pretty continuous throughout the year, and all four quarters of being able to get increases, as contracts renewed and certainly would expect to continue that, as we transition into 2021. Jason Seidl : And any comments on the market with UPS Freight and the purchase of that -- of those guys, or do you not run into them too much? Adam Satterfield : I don't really want to comment on, one specific carrier per se. But I certainly think that, the industry itself showed a lot of discipline, working through last year, especially in the second quarter when there was a lot of volume pressure. So it's been good to see the industry overall perform certainly that's been supportive of our own pricing initiatives, which we may be have philosophies that are slightly different from the industry generally, but certainly would expect a very favorable pricing environment in 2021. There's, a lot of factors that would go into that certainly demand is incredibly strong, capacity is generally limited, that's a lot of feedback that we are getting from customers right now. And that's just across the transportation space. And then, I think that, some of the other LTL carriers that utilize some truckload carriers for their line-haul services, certainly are facing may be more cost inflation than we are. And typically in that type of environment rates are rising faster as well to offset that cost inflation for those other carriers businesses. So I think there's a lot of factors that would point to industry pricing being very favorable for this year. And certainly should be supportive of our pricing initiatives. Jason Seidl : Yeah. I would agree it seems like the backdrop is pretty good for the LTL business. Wanted to do a quick question, Adam, you mentioned that there is going to be some marketing advertising costs coming back. Could you give us an idea of the magnitude of those costs? Adam Satterfield : We've never really split out exactly, what we spend and where so to speak. Obviously, we've got some big national deals. And -- and we kind of put some programs on hold last year. And so, I think that -- would not expect those costs necessarily to be higher than where they were last year, but it's certainly something that we're expecting the cost to be higher if you will, than maybe what we've just seen in the past couple of quarters. That's really since we started making some changes and trying to address all of our cost initially in the second quarter of 2020. A lot of those items that were directly or indirectly affected by the pandemic the -- some temporary and some might be permanent we're in that general supplies and expenses line. And generally speaking, in the second quarter third quarter, those cost are more between 2.5% to 3%. We'd expect it to kind of go back up where in the past they've been 3% to 3.5%, somewhere not maybe to the full extent of that 3.5%. The calls will be continue to see some of those savings like I mentioned earlier, related to travel and so forth, but certainly kind of coming back maybe more to that range, but hopefully at the low end of it. Jason Seidl : That's very helpful. Listen, gentlemen. I appreciate the time as always. Please be safe out there. Greg Gantt : Thanks Jason. Operator : And next we'll go to, David Ross with Stifel. David Ross : Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Greg Gantt : Dave. Adam Satterfield : Dave. David Ross : So, sometimes less is more or stop, doing stupid stuff is good advice. What is the one thing that you were doing maybe five to 10 years ago Greg or Adam that you're not doing now, that has made the biggest impact? Greg Gantt : I might have to go back a little further than that, David. I don't know, I think, we quit doing stupid things, maybe further than that. I don't know your question kind of -- it took me by surprise, but... David Ross : Well, if you go back to kind of 2005, 2006 because, I know that's when a lot of the service improvements started. Is there anything that you were doing then that just got in the way that you removed? Greg Gantt : So, we were somewhat like some of our competitors back in the day. We used a lot of purchase transportation. We were dependent upon those for our line-haul modes and whatnot we eliminated that over the years, and I think by and large we just gotten better. I don't want to say that we did stupid things, maybe that's not exactly the right terminology but I think we've just gotten smarter and we've gotten better over the years. We've understood better what our customer needs are and we figured out how to meet those needs, what do they really want what do they really need, and I think we're just better at it today than we were some years ago certainly. And I think it's indicative of our share growth continuing to win the MASTIO, which is a pretty good measure in stick of service. So I think it's maybe not what we did stupid but just what we've done smarter and what we've done better than our competitors have done, so maybe that's the best way to state it. David Ross : The MASTIO survey is terrific. Something else you've done smarter and better it's been on the pricing side, but that also wasn't always the case. Can you talk a little bit about the process to get to where you had your old pricing system model, accounts, rates and getting it to where you want to go? Is there a few key things you need to focus on or do along the way, because you don't want to just raise rates and have customers leave. Greg Gantt : Well, David, I think the pricing really goes hand-in-hand with the service. When your service is poor, sometimes the only way you're going to put a shipment on the truck is just give a cheaper rate. Once we really got the service click and lock it needed to be then we were in a much better position to raise our prices and I think we've been extremely disciplined over the years. And as the years have gone on, we've put in all the systems the dimensioners and all the techniques and all the technology that helps us to better understand exactly what our cost are be it P&D, be it line-haul, be it movement, delivery whatever. I think we certainly better understand our costs now than we did certainly 15 years ago, and we've executed on that understanding. So I think that's certainly been huge for us no doubt and we'll continue to be. We're disciplined, we know what our cost are in I think that's certainly one thing that sets us apart and helps to drive our numbers for sure. David Ross : Excellent. Thank you very much. Greg Gantt : Sure. Thanks David. Operator : Next we'll go to Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good morning. If you see you to look at the outlook for 2021, and I know you guys don't like to guide the OR but if I go back to the last time your -- the growth tonnage double-digit to with 2018, your incremental margins were, sort of, in the 35% range. Not looking for a specific number this time around, but when you think about 2021 relative to 2018 at least from a cost perspective, is there anything that we should be thinking about, is labor tighter or the cost generally a little bit more inflationary now, and maybe the timing of volume growth versus resource additions potentially more challenging, or is there anything else that we should be thinking about if we're trying to use that as a rough rule of thumb of how you guys might perform of the course of 2021? Greg Gantt : Certainly we're going to face a lot of challenges as we go through this year and while certain top-line comps might be easier if you will. I mean, we were pretty proud to produce a lot of growth and profits in 2020 despite the fact that the revenues were down. At the end of the day we generated almost $90 million of the increase in operating income despite our revenues being down about $95 million. So certainly in some respects we'll have some tough comps, but I think this sort of pulling back and looking at our cost inflation anticipate that we'll probably see cost per shipment inflation around 4% this year. And it's a little bit higher than our longer term average, but I think we've got some factors that that will be coming back to us. I mentioned some of the general supplies and expense type inflation we might see would anticipate a little bit higher healthcare inflation this year. So we're going to see some inflationary pressures in some of the other categories. We always have a 3% to 3.5% inflationary cost in our salaries, wages and benefits as we continue to improve that program for our employees. And so all those factors will go into that metric and that will be our target and then that becomes the target for, which our long-term philosophy of trying to get 75 to a 100 basis points of rate increase above the cost inflation and then we just worked through from there. But I think that we've talked about the key ingredients for long-term, operating ratio improvement, or the improvement in density and yield, and I think certainly the macro set up would lead you to believe that we should be able to produce nice improvements in both. And we've gone through two years of being flat and each year, I thought that, we would have had some growth and certainly didn't expect the industrial slowdown in 2019. And I don't know that, Nostradamus is could predict what we saw last year, but we worked our way through it and I think we're in a good spot as we enter the year, and we're just going to continue to work our plan to try to drive the operating ratio lower. We've talked about kind of having a goal per se not necessarily incremental margins, because the reality is we're managing the business to put as much profit to the bottom line as we can and last year, the success that we saw sort of proves that out, but certainly should be in a position to create some strong incrementals this year, and we'll keep working toward the long-term goal that we've talked about of driving the operating ratio to a 75, so we'll just keep making progress there month-by-month and quarter-by-quarter as we work through 2021. Chris Wetherbee : Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. And then just quick follow-up here thinking about the CapEx budget obviously stepping up and understandably so, can you talk a little bit I know you've given us some breakdown, but can you talk a little bit about sort of the opportunities that you see there in terms of deploying that capital? And then relative to that 30% available capacity coming into 2021, how do you want to sort of maintain that? Is that roughly the right amount of available capacity you'd like to have as you move forward? Greg Gantt : We generally talk about sort of 25% kind of plus or minus of excess capacity. And I think that continuing our CapEx programs through 2019 and 2020 continuing to build out the service center network certainly is going to pay dividends for us this year, with the increase in volumes that we're seeing now and would expect and probably for 2022 as well. So, I mean, we maintained our CapEx spending on real estate, and really last year was more just cutting back on the equipment and that was a plan we had in effect when we started the year and before seeing the pandemic effect on our business. But we were fortunate that that was part of the plan and certainly health and we didn't see the type of inflation and depreciation cost that, we normally would see and that was a big benefit there. But I think we're in a good spot. We're going to continue to look for opportunities. We've got a good plan on the real estate side the 275, is a good starting point. But we maintain our long-term plan and trying to look at multiple years out and still sort of have a target list of 30 to 40 properties and we'll keep our eyes peeled, and if some things become available. Certainly, we've got the strength to be able to pull the trigger on that and we'd look to just continue to make those expansions to really prepare the network for growth that's multiple years down the road. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Got it. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. Operator : And next, we'll go to Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Just a couple of follow-ups. First, how many service centers are you adding this year? And then within the January update, can you just talk about weight per shipment trends? Greg Gantt : Not only additional service centers, we have three that we're very close to opening that may open in the first quarter, if not first certainly second. And then, we have another half dozen or so that we're working on so just depends, if we get them completed or not. It's not always easy to sit here nine months out and say exactly what we're going to finish, but hopefully, another half dozen or so on top of the three that we are really, really close to opening there. Adam Satterfield : And then on the weight per shipment, it was 1,625 pound in January, which was a 4.6% increase there so continuing to see strong weight per shipments. Our business is still leaning a little heavier, if you will on our larger national accounts that have a higher weight per shipment on average. But I think that the strength in that number is some of our smaller customers get healthier and are making up coming back to normal, if you will in terms of a percent of our business. It's just a reflection on the strength in the economy right now and probably seeing a little bit of some spillover type freight that it's coming into the network as well. Scott Group : Okay. And then Adam, how quickly do you expect the PTE spend to normalizes with higher than normal headcount in growth in 1Q, do you think you get back to normal PTE by 2Q or is it more back half you think? Adam Satterfield : It's hard to say, because it's going to be dependent upon the top-line performance. And certainly, we had a really strong sequential performance in 4Q. It was going through the sequentials last year and unprecedented drop like everyone else experienced from 1Q to 2Q, and then the reverse happened going into 3Q, but then incredibly strong performance going into 4Q, and I think we're starting out with some strength here in January as well. So, we're going to continue to make use of it really until the capacity of our team sort of catches up with the volume growth that we're seeing. So I don't -- wouldn't expect it to necessarily go any higher, because I think we're doing a great job of on-boarding people right now and keep in pace. So with -- certainly in the first quarter would expect it to stay pretty consistent with where we were in 4Q and we'd hope that we can start seeing it reduce a little bit in the second, but it could be more of a second half of the year, but again, I think it's just going to be top-line driven more than anything. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you guys. Greg Gantt : Scott. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next we'll go to Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Gentlemen, I want to follow-up to a response about your earlier questions. It was pointed out that you've significantly outgrown the industry and a lot of that has been driven by share gain over the years, and you said that you expected the industry to be good, but not gangbusters growth in the next five years. So I just wanted to get a sense of kind of in your analysis of the industry structure right now, do you feel like you can keep up that outsized share gain kind of trend over the next several years? Do you think kind of that potential exists? Greg Gantt : I think it certainly does Ravi. We are -- our entire strategy is to continue to grow our capacity and increase our service center network and which is what we -- as you know, we've worked extremely hard to do that over the past 10, 15 years, and I think we've done it extremely well. So I think we are positioning to take advantage of whatever growth is out there. And I would certainly expect that we would outgrow our competitors. For the most part, we have not seen that from them. So we'll see where that goes, but I think we're well-positioned and certainly in a good spot to continue to take share. Ravi Shanker : And you have said in the past that kind of you tend to gain accelerated share when the markets kind of starting to turn up rather than the market is going down. Are you seeing that already like in the fourth quarter and in January so far? Adam Satterfield : We are. Yes. We are seeing that. We're seeing the response from our customers. We've had numerous situations where our competitors could or didn't respond for whatever the reason and we were able to take advantage of that. So again, that's why we're doing what we're doing from a capacity standpoint, so we can be there when the need arises. Ravi Shanker : Got it. And just a follow-up, can you give us a little more color on your thoughts on this UPS, TFI deal, because I think it's a pretty big deal for the industry structure going forward. Were you surprised by that transaction at all and do you think this kicks off a domino effect of M&A or consolidation in the industry especially some of -- among some of the non-union players? Adam Satterfield : Like I said earlier, we'd rather just not comment on any specific competitors and transactions or whatnot. But I think regardless of who our competitors are, I think, we've kind of proven. What Greg just said, we keep focused on executing our plan making the investments. We have a service advantage in the marketplace and we have a capacity advantage as well and we're just going to keep doing our thing and staying focused on our employees, staying focused on our customers, and then just let in the financials kind of fall out in the end and that's included a lot of profitable growth over the years and certainly expect that to continue to do that regardless of the landscape. Ravi Shanker : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And next we'll go to Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Good morning. Wanted to ask, I know, you've had a few on this topic and you're not being granular about it but the TFI, UPS, you could argue that there might be some freights build into the market and they need to price up a lot and I think TFI is certainly shown that there disciplined in their approach they're not focused on volume they're focused on making money. So I don't know if you have a thought on whether they have good quality freight or not, but if you don't want to be that granular, perhaps you could offer a thought on is there bad freight that you don't want when there is tight capacity or is it simply a function of all freight is good as long as you price it right? Adam Satterfield : I think that the latter comment probably is the most appropriate. There is -- there probably is such a thing as bad freight not a ton of it, but there is a lot of bad pricing out there. So, priced appropriately there is very little bad freight, you just have to price based on what that particular commodity cost due to move it. And anyway I think, Tom, we've done that better than most and we understand if there is something that's expensive to hall of handle then, we're going to price it accordingly. What does that mean from the UPS or TransForce acquisition, who knows we'll just have to wait and see. I'm not sure what their strategy has been up in the Canadian market or down on this site at all, but we'll have to see certainly if they execute on the raise in prices and whatnot, I think that will be good for our industry. So I don't see it is certainly not from this standpoint now, it's not a negative, so I think that be good for all of us. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah, right, okay. That makes sense. How do you think about mix in terms of industrial versus consumer? I think the kind of surprisingly strong swing back in freight in June, July, August, even in the fall, was that more on the consumer side? And I think you know the story in '21 would seem to be that industrial catches up or at least there is a stronger swing in industrial, is that something which could be meaningful in terms of your mix and helpful in terms of the operating ratio performance or how do you think about that potential impact if there's more industrial freight and not as much of a step-up in consumer? Adam Satterfield : One, we are more exposed to the industrial markets, as is the industry and our percentages stayed pretty consistent in '20 with '19, we're still 55% to 60% of our revenues industrial-related and close to 30 -- 25% to 30% industrial-related and over the balance of the year, they came in about the same that they were the year prior in. Fourth quarter revenue performance was pretty consistent with our industrial customers and retail-related customers as well, they were both in about the same range. So we look to certainly see the improvement in the industrial economy though create freight opportunities for us. And then, as Greg mentioned earlier, I think that there is going to be ongoing opportunity on the retail side and kind of leading up to 2020, we're probably seeing a little bit more growth in that retail area than on the industrial side, and I would expect that we'd see a little bit stronger performance there. But I think with respect to margins, we talked a lot about this throughout 2020 on our calls that our operating philosophy is, we want each customer to stand on its own. We measure the profitability of each customer and we look at each customer's operating ratio and whether it's a large national account or a smaller account or retail or industrial, they all should contribute in their own ways and that's how we try to manage the business and then look at each individual customer and try to drive continuous improvement with our operating ratio by keeping the business intact and just continuing to make improvements year in and year out with them. So the balance in the mix shift from one category to the next in that industrial versus retail categories or the national ship reverses the smaller one. I think we kind of proved out last year with our operating performance that we're true to our word in that regard and that each do kind of operate close to one another. So either way, we get the growth going into '21, certainly we'd expected it can continue to drive and help us drive improvement in the operating ratio. Tom Wadewitz : Great, that's very clear and helpful. Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Jon Chappell : Thank you, good morning. First one, kind of bigger picture of macro drag on kind of on the last question as well. I think, there is a consensus view that the industrial economy is going to catch up to the consumer this year, at least that's the hope. That number that you put up on tons in January is obviously a pretty big number. Is that indicative of the industrial economy starting to show signs of really building momentum in your opinion or is that really kind of just a catch-up from the depths of the pandemic in the middle part of last year? Greg Gantt : I think its may be an effect of both, to be honest with you. I know there's catch up and resupply for sure, but no doubt about that. So we'll see where it goes as the year develops but hopefully the industrials do start to catch up. I think that'd be certainly a good thing for us as well as our industry. Jon Chappell : Okay. And your customer is generally optimistic this from ton? Greg Gantt : For the most part, yes. Jon Chappell : Great. And then the follow-up is, you mentioned right at the beginning of your comments about your spare capacity. So it certainly seems like you're lined up, this industrial economy does catch up. Are there any issues that may restrict your ability to take on new business, whether that's labor restrictions, just hiring, whether it's drivers or at terminals or any other issues beyond the obvious kind of equipment capacity? Greg Gantt : I don't think so, not beyond the obvious. I mean labor is a challenge, it's little tougher than it used to be, for sure, but we are having success. Adam mentioned it in his comments before, but our service centers are responding to their needs, and we are having success of adding employees', drivers', platform whatever the needs -- wherever the needs are. We are having that success. So that's a good thing. I wished it was a little bit faster, we could respond a little bit quicker, but it is what it is, but I think we're getting there. Sometimes your growth numbers changes your challenges, if you know what I mean. It's one thing, if it's in a some moderate tight growth, if the growth really starts to accelerate then the challenge becomes a little bit greater. So I think in a controlled tight growth environment, we're in great perfect shape. If we get a huge acceleration then that challenge is going to accelerate along with it. So we'll see where it goes but nothing right now and in our way certainly. We are... Jon Chappell : Okay. Greg Gantt : Expecting a great year. Jon Chappell : Certainly, it seems like you're responding quicker than most. Thanks for the thoughts Greg. Operator : Next we'll go to Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison Landry : Thanks, good morning. So just in terms of the January revenue per hundredweight, up 2.2 is that inclusive of fuel? And if so, could you give us the ex-fuel number. And then just thinking about the 4.2% yield growth ex-fuel in Q4, maybe if you could give us a sense of what that looks like if you exclude the mix impacts from weight per shipment and length of haul? Just trying to get a sense of the underlying core pricing trends. Greg Gantt : Yeah, Allison that January number did include the fuel and excluding the fuel is pretty consistent the growth rate was pretty consistent with the fourth quarter so just over 4% if you will, and we'll continue to see until about April, really I think that that delta and some pressure on the fuel surcharge revenue and showing up in those metrics. I think that fuel was pretty consistently higher until about April of last year and then fuel trends hold current that will start becoming a little bit of a tailwind finally for us on a top-line basis. But I think that certainly, when you look through last year and kind of how that yield number excluding fuel is up 4.2% in the fourth quarter, there is not a perfect analysis if you will. There is not a linear way, purely linear way to evaluate the change in weight per shipment and length of haul but we had more pressure from the increase in weight per shipment in the middle part of the year in the second and third quarters. So certainly that 2.5% increase on the weight per shipment has got a negative effect but then you've got a 1.3% increase in the length of haul, so I mean there is somewhat offsetting. And I think that just the underlying performance and we review the \u2013 our growth in renewals and so forth consistent with our long-term average. We've been around whether you look over the past 10 to 15 years, we've been able to average about a 4.5% increase in our revenue per shipment and I think that we are pretty much in that category somewhere around that ballpark for last year. And certainly like I mentioned earlier, the strategy is always to try to target 75 to 100 basis points above our cost and I think that that's been a good consistent approach. We're not trying to necessarily always follow the market with more of a roller coaster type of approach we like it to be consistent. Customers generally appreciate that and it's easier conversation to have when you're just talking about pure cost or customers operating ratio to talk about the need for an increase but we'll continue to sort of target that type of range and certainly expect next year to be supportive of our ability to do so. Allison Landry : Okay, thank you for that. And then just I mean, so it seems like you should be able to generate pretty strong free cash flow this year even with elevated CapEx. I know you raised the dividends but maybe if you can share any thoughts you have on buybacks in 2021 and if that might accelerate from the repellent in 2020. Thank you. GregGantt: Yeah, certainly, when we've talked about priorities for capital allocation in the past, obviously the $605 million of CapEx, CapEx is the number one position. And I think while we've have been able to create such strong returns on invested capital and I want to keep investing there, but the excess capital that we've been generating in the business, we've been increasingly returning to our shareholders and we stepped up the pace of our buybacks last year and it's been a little over $360 million on the buyback program in 2020. So that was a nice step-up and we'll just continue to look at stepping those dollars up most likely, because it's certainly not something that we want to continue to have significant balance of cash hanging around on the balance sheet. But we also want to be mindful of the fact that there may continue to be some opportunities out there from a real estate standpoint and some of those in areas like on the West Coast and in the Northeast I've got some really expensive price tag. So we'll continue to look for some opportunities there and would rather spend our dollars on something that's more strategic like a long-term investment in the service center but absent those opportunities will continue to return capital to our shareholders. Allison Landry : Okay. Thank you guys. Greg Gantt : Bye Allison. Operator : Next we'll go to Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks guys. I'll make it quick I know we're coming up on the hour here. Just one quick ones from me Adam. If you can just help us how shipments trended sequentially from December to January versus maybe how they've done over the last 10 years what the actual number was? I know there were up 7% year-over-year, but just trying to gauge the sequential strength in shipments relative to seasonality from December to January? Adam Satterfield : Sure. And I'll just go -- for the benefit of everyone, I'll go through the fourth quarter and these will be our shipments per day. So October versus September was down 3.3% November was 3% higher than October and then December was 4.2% lower than November. January was 1.4% higher than December. The 10-year average almost going back to October was a 3.3% decrease and November was a 1.8% increase and December is a 9.8% decrease. January is normally a 3% increase, but I think that given the strength of the performance that we had in both November and December as why that January numbers a little bit lower than the 10-year average given the outperformance of those two months prior. So it's been really strong performance like we said, really just throughout the year we took a little bit of a breather in October if you will. And as we were continuing to play catch-up and we're starting to get a lot of heavy shipments into the mix and -- but that was just really very temporary. And you can see kind of once we lifted any of those restrictions just the volumes continue to accelerate through the rest of the year and now into the first month of the New Year. So a lot of good favorable trends volume side. Amit Mehrotra : Yeah, so I just wanted to dig into that a little bit more. So it looks like December was double better than seasonality or half of the seasonal declines may explain a little bit of the January lag relative to seasonality. But there's three reasons why volumes could be inflecting, one is underlying growth in the industrial economy, two is spillover from truckload and three is just simple market share gains. And what I want to just be clear on is that you guys are clearly gaining market share you're clearly in the best position to drive spillover from truckload. I just what I'm trying not to -- I'm not trying to understand like the January strength on a year-over-year basis is that more indicative of OD specific factors or is it a read-through to the overall industrial economy because US industrial production is still negative on a year-over-year basis everybody expects it to inflect as we move through this year and we're right up there as well as expecting that. But I'm just trying to understand like decipher between those three attributions in terms of strong strength and strength of volumes? Adam Satterfield : You left out the quality of our sales team, so that's as point number one. But I think that we've kind of talked about these points earlier that we've got a service advantage that's unique in our industry and we're giving better service than anyone else. We've got a capacity advantage and we're starting to see and this is played out in years before, but we're starting to see this capacity advantage play out for us as well and we're getting feedback from customers that support that. And then you've got other factors, the industrial economy is improving. I know there is a lot of uncertainty and there always is in election year and now that's behind everyone, so you kind of have a better feel for what the regulatory environment and so forth is going to be. And so, hopefully, that's going to continue to support an improving economy as well, as just the country sort of reopening throughout. And so, all those factors, the demand improvement, inventories being low and the need for restocking, it's all just a matter of -- those are all favorable trends. But I think that we're uniquely positioned to take advantage of that, with market share wins, for customers that we strengthen relationships throughout last year as we work with them and we are flexible. And I think that we've got improvements there that should pay dividends for the long run. And those customers are going to increasingly give us business, we think, and some that has historically had been more price-sensitive now have seen our ability to respond with them and give them capacity in a challenge time and to give them service. And maybe it's proved too many customers that, you may pay a little bit more upfront, but the total cost of transportation service, when selecting Old Dominion, can save a company money in the long run. So there\u2019s multiple factors, but at the end of the day, it goes back to the fact that we have a service advantage and a capacity advantage and those two factors are unique and have been the basis for why we've been able to grow market share, more than anyone else in our industry over the past 10 years. Amit Mehrotra : And then, just the 76.3% OR in the quarter, can you just tell us -- deconstruct that between direct and indirect. And I guess, the bonus payments would obviously be the part of the direct costs, I would imagine, but if you can just deconstruct that for us? Adam Satterfield : It's about 56% on the direct side and so our overhead cost, now, or kind of we've talked about those cost over the long run, have been sort of between 20% to 25% of revenue. And so, again, kind of, getting back to the quality of that revenue performance, we were able to move that number back down to lower end of that range. So, something we\u2019ll just continue to build on. Those bonuses are kind of split, obviously, more heavily to -- on the direct side, but for management and non-productive labor and meaning, drivers, dock workers and our mechanics, those cost we put more on the overhead side. And so, there\u2019s an element of that bonus that would therefore be split into overhead as well, but the majority of it's going to be on the direct side. Amit Mehrotra : Yes. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Next we'll go to Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Jordan Alliger : Yes. Hi. Good morning. I'm just curious, the expansion that you're talking about of the service centers, just sort of wondering, how long does it typically take to, if you will, get the density needed to fully season one of these facilities, so that it gets closer to the margins that you wanted, or is it a situation where the density such in the area that, it can come in pretty quickly close to an OD type of margin level. Thanks. Greg Gantt : It typically does not take long in our system. We won't open additional facility till the need is there for the most part. We may certainly have excess capacity in there, but we don't fully utilize it from day one. So we're not absorbing necessarily all those cost from the outset, but typically we will put a lot of business in that service center from the get-go. So there is not usually a long climb to our typical normal type returns in a service center. Jordan Alliger : Okay, great. That was it from me. Thank you. Operator : Okay. Next we'll go to Ari Rosa with Bank of America. Ari Rosa : Hey. Good morning, guys, and congrats on a nice quarter. So, I had, kind of, two questions. So first I wanted to ask about just the weight per shipment trends and I know Scott touched on this earlier. But seeing more supply, seemingly entering the truckload market and some elevated order numbers on the Class 8 trucks, maybe you could talk about what your expectation is for, kind of, the weight per shipment trend over the course of the year and if we see that may be return to kind of normal levels, or more normalized levels, as we move toward kind of the second half? Adam Satterfield : We're -- like I mentioned, we're at 1625-pounds and I think when we've been in strong environments from strong demand backdrops. We've been around a 1600-pound average in the past. Certainly, you can go back and look at 2018 and that was around the range we were in then. So I think it can stay in this 1600 to maybe 1650 kind of range as we progress through the year and certainly we'd see some ups and downs.  But I think that like I mentioned, we're continuing to see good performance with our smaller customers and they are naturally going to have a little bit lower weight per shipment, so that will bring it down. But just the overall demand environment I think is keeping all shipments a little bit stronger from a weight perspective. I don't think we're really getting flooded, if you will with spillover-type freight. When I look through it, the business we have with third-party logistics companies, a lot of time with our capacity constraints in the market they're able to go out and find and help their customers who are also our customers find capacity. And certainly, we've seen a little bit higher weight per shipment growth with business is controlled by the 3PLs then the rest of our book of business if you will.  So I would expect it to stay in that sort of elevated range just given all the favorable economic backdrop numbers and then just the fact that we still believe capacity is generally constrained in the industry. Ari Rosa : Got it, got it. That's very helpful. And then just for my second question and I know number of people obviously asked about the TFI deal with UPS Freight. But stepping back and not necessarily addressing them specifically, but thinking about the idea of having a more focused competitive set. You guys have obviously benefited tremendously from delivering exceptional service levels. Does it perhaps risk kind of a part of your competitive advantage if peers start to improve service levels and start to kind of emulate OD more in terms of the structures of their network and the service levels that they are able to provide?  Do you see that as a competitive threat at all or do you think kind of margins can kind of remain best in-class and kind of you guys can continue doing what you're doing regardless of what our competitors are doing on the service side? Adam Satterfield : I think, it's obviously a threat, no doubt. I mean, if you got to a bad team you improve the players and it's a threat to all the other team, so no doubt. But I think they've got to do it, they've got to pull it off and there is an awful lot that goes into service and we worked awfully hard on it over the years, not only a, to be on time, but all the other things that go into a true service product and I think we do it better than others. And hey, it's out there, it's not rocket science, but they've got to do it. So we'll see how they do. Greg Gantt : Just add though to that, that the fact that it is a unionized company and the non-union carriers generally have got more flexibility within their workforce in a better service product and you've seen more market share movement to the non-union players as the length of haul shrink in and there is more of a premium within supply chains to look at carriers that can respond the next day and second-day needs. And I think that we've got more flexibility as a group of non-union carriers.  I mean, I think we've got an advantage within that group as we've talked about earlier to be able to continue to win share. So I mean that's something that's been playing out over the long run and we'd expect to continue to see share movement from unionized and non-unionized players. Ari Rosa : Got it, got it. And that's a terrific answer and thank you for the time and you guys clearly have a strong track record in that regard. So thanks for that. Greg Gantt : All right. Operator : And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Greg Gantt : Well, thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate the questions and please feel free to call us if you have anything further. Thanks and have a great day. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir. Greg Gantt : Good morning. And welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. We are pleased to report a great start to 2021 for Old Dominion. Our financial results were highlighted by new first quarter records for revenue, operating ratio and earnings per diluted share. The operating momentum that began in the second half of 2020 continued through the quarter and we also benefited from and improving domestic economy. Our revenue increase to $1.1 billion as a result, which is the highest level of quarterly revenue we have ever achieved. 14.1% revenue growth rate was also our highest since the fourth quarter of 2018. After essentially going through two flattish years in 2019 and 2020, our revenue was relatively flat over the past two years, and that was an unusually long period for us to go without growth. We maintained our commitment to our long term strategic plan and invested during those times for our future. Our first quarter financial results validate the benefits of this long term strategy. Our strategic plan has worked throughout many economic cycles. We generally see our largest increases in market share when the domestic economy is strong, and industry capacity is generally limited. This is the environment in which we are now operating. We have also recently received encouraging feedback from many of our customers regarding the ongoing recovery of this business, of these business levels and their increased demand for our services. As a result, we expect to see a continued acceleration in our market share trends as we progress through this year. Our focus is never to simply increase market share and revenues. Our objective is to win market share in a way that can produce profitable revenue growth. We achieve this goal in the first quarter, as our ability to deliver best-in-class service at a fair price contributed to the increase in our volumes, resulting improvement in density, as well as an increase in yield that exceeded cost inflation led to the 76.1% operating ratio for the quarter and 53% increase in earnings per diluted share. The favorable operating environment and improving trends we intend to invest significantly in all elements of capacity this year to support our revenue growth initiatives. This starts with our OD family of employees, which already grew by over 1000 new full time employees during the first quarter. We intend to hire additional employees this year to further increase the capacity of our workforce. In addition, we all support our team's ability to deliver superior service by investing approximately $605 million in capital expenditures during 2021. This total includes new tractors and trailers, as well as an expansion of our service center network that could include an additional four to six service centers. We will also continue to invest in new technologies that are designed to improve customer service and increase the efficiency of our operation. OD team will be diligent in managing productivity, cost and capacity this year to maximize our ability to produce profitable growth in 2021. This diligence, however, will not affect our focus on the long term opportunities for our business. We believe we are the best position company in the LTL industry to win market share in both the current environment and over the long term. This provides us with confidence that the continued execution of our strategic plan, combined with our financial strength and available network capacity, can produce additional growth in earnings and increased shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning. And now, Adam will discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $1.1 billion, which was a 14.1% increase from the prior year despite having one less work day. Our operating ratio improved 530 basis points to 76.1% and earnings per diluted share increase to $1.70. Our per day revenue growth of 15.9% included a nice mix of increases in both our LTL tons and yield. LTL tons per day increased 10%, while our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 5.6%. We are winning market share as demand for our industry leading service has increased while the domestic economy is improving. In addition to our service advantage that includes 99% on time performance and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1%, our proven strategy of investing and service center capacity ahead of anticipated growth has also provided us with a capacity advantage in the marketplace. This strategy is different for many of our competitors, as we believe the average number of service centers operated by the other large LTL carriers has decreased over the past 10 years. We currently have approximately 25% excess capacity within our service center network, which is in line with our long term targets and we plan to further expand our network this year to stay ahead of our growth. Our plan is to ensure that our network is never a limiting factor to growth. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the first quarter increase 3.3% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 with LTL tons per day increasing 0.7% and LTL shipments per day increasing 1.5%. These were all above our normal sequential trends, which typically declined from the fourth quarter. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the first quarter were as follows; January increased 0.3% as compared with December, February decreased 4.4% versus January, and March increased 10.7% as compared to February. The 10-year average change for the respective months are an increase of 1.2% in January, an increase of 2.2% in February, and an increase of 5.1% in March. While there are still many workdays that remain in April, our revenue performance has remained strong. Our month to-date revenue per day has increased by approximately 45% to 50% when compared to April of 2020. As a reminder, our revenue decreased 19.3% in April 2020, due to the significant impact of the COVID related shutdowns. We will provide the actual revenue related details for April in our first quarter form 10-Q. Our first quarter operating ratio improved to 76.1% with improvements in both our direct operating cost and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. We have said many times before that the long term improvement or operating ratio requires an improvement in density and yield, both of which are generally supported by a favorable macro economic environment. The strength of our first quarter results reflect how important these factors are to our success. Our direct costs benefited from an improvement in our line-haul laden-load average and pick up delivery shipments per hour during the quarter. We lost a little productivity on the dock. But that is common when business levels accelerate and we add a significant number of new employees. While we would like to see our platform productivity improved, we believe it is more important for these employees to properly load our trailers to maximize employee safety in line-haul efficiency, while also protecting free from damage. As Greg mentioned, we will continue to add drivers and platform employees during the second quarter as our volume trends continue to accelerate. We will also continue to use purchase transportation to supplement our workforce until the capacity of our team can support our anticipated growth. We improved our overhead cost as a percent of revenue during the first quarter primarily by successfully leveraging a revenue growth. As expected and mentioned on our fourth quarter call, certain calls that were reduced in 2020 because of the pandemic have started to increase. While many of these calls such as travel and customer entertainment are not completely back to pre-pandemic levels. We expect that there will be sequential increases in aggregate overhead costs this year. We will maintain our disciplined approach to controlling discretionary spending however, and make every effort to minimize cost inflation and other areas. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations total $310.3 million for the first quarter and capital expenditures were $51 million. We currently anticipate our capital expenditures to be approximately $605 million this year, which includes $275 million for service center expansion projects. We utilize $309 million for our share repurchase program and paid $23.2 million in dividends during the first quarter. The total share repurchase amount includes $275 million attributable to an accelerated share repurchase agreement that was executed during the first quarter. Our first quarter shares outstanding reflects the initial delivery of shares under this Agreement, and a final calculation of total shares. repurchased will occur no later than the end of August of this year. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2021 was 26.0% as compared to 26.3% in the first quarter of 2020. And we currently expect our annual effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the second quarter of 2021. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we would be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take the first question. At this time it comes from Jack Atkins from Stevens. Please go ahead. Jack Atkins : Great. Thank you. Good morning and congrats on a great quarter, guys. Greg Gantt : Thanks, Jack. Jack Atkins : So, so maybe if we can just start with April. And I know, the month isn't done yet. So -- and I know you want to hold off on the specific comments until the 10-Q comes out. But Adam, would it would it be possible to maybe kind of talk bigger picture around what you're seeing sequentially in April relative to March? The comparisons, both year-over-year and sequentially are just abnormal this year, because of what was happening last year, and obviously, how strong March was. Can you maybe talk about what you're seeing April versus March from a tonnage and shipment perspective relative to normal seasonality? Adam Satterfield : And it's hard to get into the details of that on tonnage and shipments basis, because the trends have been a little more or unusual, if you will, and not following the same types of patterns in the sense of the way -- our weight per shipment has been trending intra month and so forth. We've been seeing some wider shipments earlier in the month, and then it just strengthens throughout and then gets heavy at the end. But nevertheless, our overall revenue, obviously 45% to 50% on a comparison basis with April suggests that we are seeing continued strength and acceleration in our business. We had incredibly strong performance in March, at tonnage per day, that was up 10.7% versus the normal 5.1% increase, that was the 10-year average. And then that followed the weakness that we saw in February. So probably, a little bit of recovery there, that helps support that number. And then just the way the math work. But I think that we're continuing to see revenue perform pretty much in line with what we'd expect from a sequential standpoint. As you mentioned, the year-over-year weights and shipments are going to look a little unusual. Whereas last year, we had such an increase in late March and through April, and the weight per shipment. So that certainly will throw things off a bit. But we'd look to see continued strong revenue performance, and whether that's coming through in tonnage, shipments and yield, I think it's really all of the above. They're all performing well, and contributing to excellent revenue quality, and obviously in the first quarter that's contributing to really strong profitable growth force. Jack Atkins : Absolutely. Absolutely it is. So that's great to hear on the April trends. And then, I guess maybe a bigger picture question to follow up. We're hearing from a number of LTLs, both public and private, that they're highly capacity constrained, given what's happening in the broader market. And they're taking steps to actually limit the volume that they're taking in from their customers. And I would think that given the latent capacity that you guys have in your network, you mentioned 25% in your prepared comments, this is going to give you a chance to really demonstrate your value proposition, potentially, to new customers. So I guess, how are you thinking about balancing the approach between making sure you're handling the needs of your existing customer base that are surging volumes, but also perhaps using this opportunity in a capacity constrained environment to expand your customer base? How do you balance those two factors? Greg Gantt : Jack, as you know, we've always talked about our ability to grow and outgrow our competitors when the market was strong, like it is today. So I think we're definitely seeing the evidence of that. We're not capacity constrained. I think we've made tremendous investments, particularly in the last 10 or 15 years to increase our capacity and it's obviously paying off for. So, I think we're in a very unique and a very positive position when the market turns as positive as it is today. From the standpoint of constricting volumes or limiting volumes, whatever you want to call it, we have not had to do that. We have limited some truckload type shipments that we're coming our way more so -- more strong, much stronger back in March than today. But we have had to limit some of those types shipments and keep them out of the truckload. But otherwise we're not capacity constraint. It's full steam ahead where we're trying to hire and add to our workforce to meet those capacity demands. And so far we're having success. I wish it was sometimes it would happen a little bit quicker than it does. But we're in a good position moving forward and all things go. Jack Atkins : Right, Greg, Adam, thanks for the comments. Appreciate it, guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question. It comes from Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. Congrats, Adam, Greg on a great quarter. If I think about the sequential acceleration in April, just trying to understand if you're seeing that in yields, as well. Or yield holding kind of at these levels, at these high levels, and you're seeing tonnage and shipment growth accelerate? And the reason I just asked this question is I'm trying to understand, when OpEx per shipment has to inflect more meaningfully getting back to closer to that 4% to 5% level, because it's actually been declining over the last couple quarters. Partly, I assume, because of the attribution to growth from yield and pricing. So just talk about yields, where yields are moving prospectively from here? And when you think OpEx per shipment needs to get back higher as shipment growth moves up? Adam Satterfield : Yes. The yield numbers is similar to conversation we just had about volume. They're going to look a little unusual as well. Last year in April, our average weight per shipment was 1677 pounds.. And we've been trending now around the 1600 pound range. So we're going to see, if things continue a pretty meaningful drop, and that similar to what we experienced in March as well. So you can with a big decrease in the weight per shipment, obviously that has a favorable impact on revenue per hundredweight. And so we've got a big inflection there. Not to mention that last year in April was when the fuel dropped significantly. So we're going to have a bigger contribution from the fuel surcharge as well. You might be looking at and certainly we saw double digit type increase in revenue per hundredweight. And that doesn't tell the story necessarily from a pure yield and revenue per shipment standpoint. And we saw a nice improvement in the first quarter on revenue per shipment. And that benefited from both higher weight per shipment and a higher length of haul as well. And all those metrics go into our yield management process. We've got a process that's focused on individual account profitability, and one that focuses on continuous improvement as well. And I think that our sales team, our pricing teams, they've worked really hard over the last couple of years, to make sure that we're seeing continuous improvement in each of our customers operating ratios. And that's certainly bearing fruit when you look at our numbers and how that may transition into the second quarter as well. So, it's probably going to be more of just looking at that pure number. Look and comparison on a sequential basis from first quarter revenue per hundredweight that I know drive everyone's models in that normal sequential transition from 1Q to 2Q. And if you look at it excluding the field, we were right at $21 on a revenue per hundredweight basis in 1Q. And typically, we see, an average about 1.5% increase from 1Q to 2Q if mix is held constant. So that would suggest another $0.25 to $0.30 sort of sequential increase, if you will, and that revenue per hundredweight metric excluding the fuel. But we're going to continue on with our focus and you asked about OpEx as well. The long term plan has always been to balance our revenue per shipment versus the cost per shipment performance and having a positive delta there to support the ongoing investments and capacity that essentially we're making on behalf of our customers, As well as investments in technology, tools and so forth. It can help us keep our cost structure lower, so that we can improve profit per shipment, without having to rely completely on pricing initiatives. But if we can continue to keep costs in check through productivity, and certainly right now, we're benefiting from the strong top line growth and just the increase in shipment is creating operating leverage that that's benefiting our cost structure there. And, as you mentioned, we did see a decrease in cost per shipment in the first quarter. But we were expecting, like we mentioned at the beginning of this year, core inflation of kind of 4% to 4.5%. We're just benefiting right now significantly from the leverage and productivity, yield performance in our business. Amit Mehrotra : Yes. And do you guys expect a step -- usually do see a step down in OR from 1Q to 2Q? I assume you'll expect that as well. But first quarter was quite strong as well. And pricing has been strong. So any thoughts around kind of the sequential progression in OR from 1Q to 2Q? Adam Satterfield : Yes. It's certainly. I mean, that's the quarter where we get the biggest improvement. It's the quarter where we typically see the largest sequential increase in revenue performance as well. Typically, revenue per day is up 10% in the second quarter versus the first. And so, that leverage on existing cost base and so forth creates that opportunity for us. So -- we've -- on any given year, we've increased or improved the operating ratio in a range of 360 to 420 basis points. And certainly, we would expect to get some improvement this year. We've done a good job the last three quarters and have had nice sequential changes that have been kind of what our normal progression is. But now, we're starting to look at the cost that you mentioned that we expect to have some increases in our aggregate overhead costs. We performed very well in the first quarter and had some costs in categories that kind of went well for us. That we'll see if all the stars stay aligned as we transitioned in the second quarter. But certainly, our focus is always to produce as much profitable growth as we can. And we will continue to look at it, leveraging the improvement in our revenue and trying to continue with our productivity initiatives. Some of that, like we saw in the first quarter, where we lost a little productivity on the dock, as we continue to hire new employees and put them into the operation. Certainly, you can start seeing a little bit of headwind on productivity there. But our operation is running extremely smooth right now. And we're going to keep focused on making sure that we're focused mainly on keeping our service metrics best-in-class, secondary focus on productivity. But at the end of the day, we're trying to produce as much profitable growth as we can. Amit Mehrotra : Yes. Low 70s OR in the second quarter implied by seasonality would be pretty impressive. Thanks so much, guys. Appreciate it. Congrats again. Operator : Our next question comes from Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good morning, Greg and Adam. So I just wanted to ask about the length of haul I mean, its been increasing for the last few quarters, and you're now sort of at the longest haul. I think you'd have to go back five years or so. So I'm just curious to understand. And do you think this is mainly a function of cyclicality? Or would you attribute this to some kind of secular shift, maybe e-commerce or something like that? Just trying to understand your view, if you think there's an underlying shift in the market or the freight dynamic? Greg Gantt : I don't think there's necessarily a big underlying change. The big picture changes that we feel like length of haul will probably shorten and that will continue to see improvement in our regional business. But we still have a very high quality, long haul and medium haul business. And I would say, over the past 12 months, really, since the COVID impact on the mix of our business that we've probably just seen a little bit more market share in with our contractual business, and certainly saw more growth. And for many periods out of the West right now, our growth is very balanced across all of our regions, but a lot of times the freight coming out of the West will have a longer length of haul associated with it. So we've seen tremendous growth there. And that's probably been causing a little uptick. But long term when we think about that continued shift and tailwind that we believe exist with e-commerce freight, we'd expect to see that market share and those regional lanes continue to increase and probably pull the length of haul back down with it. Allison Landry : Okay. So length of haul comes down and probably over time and then right now just be more mixed driven. Is that the way to characterize it? Is that fair? Greg Gantt : Exactly. Allison Landry : Okay. And then just, I mean, on the labor front, obviously, everyone's having challenges as far as hiring drivers and dock workers, warehouse called that. I mean, is it -- are you guys finding it more difficult than you've seen in past cyclical upswing or even tight capacity conditions that where you're sort of falling behind plan in terms of where you want to be for hiring? Or are you guys able to meet that? And maybe if you can speak to just the broader wage inflation and your expectations there? Thank you. Greg Gantt : Allison, I would say it's definitely a little more difficult than it has been in years past. But we're having success. Like I mentioned earlier, I wish sometimes it would happen a little bit quicker than it does. But we are having success. We're adding where needed. In the locations where we're having job fairs and things like that, run ads or whatever, we're, we're getting a nice response. And again, we're having success meeting our needs. I wish it was a little quicker. We've had a pretty significant uptick in business when -- as Adam mentioned, talking about April 45% to 50% increase, be it we were down last year. Still, that's a pretty significant uptick in business. And the difficulty is meeting the needs as quickly as the business is coming at you. So, I think that's the challenge. But again, I think we're doing well. We just have to stay focused on it and get the folks on board, which I feel confident we'll be able to do. So, I do not think that will limit us going forward. Adam Satterfield : And on the labor inflation standpoint, we gave our wage increase in September of last year. We would not expect -- or we're seeing the effects of that. And that was part of that overall core inflation of 4% to 4.5%. That was probably, all in 3% to 3.5%. So we're seeing that until September of this coming year on just pure inflation standpoint. But we are continuing to use the purchase transportation, though, and that amount stayed pretty much in the same range as where it was in the fourth quarter. And we talked about, hoping to see that number decline as we progress through the second quarter. And at this point, it's staying at the same level. So we'll keep using that supplement, the workforce until really we're in position to be able to handle anticipated growth with our complete team and everything in sourced where we would like it to be. But that's probably, we expect to still see PTE [ph] decrease on the second half, but just may be a little bit later in the year. But really the goal will be getting the workforce where it needs to be not only for this year, but really just gearing up and preparing for 2022. Allison Landry : Okay. That's great. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll take the next question. It comes from Chris Wetherbee from Citi. Please go ahead. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe just want to pick up on the on the pricing side. Can you talk a little bit sort of contractual pricing renewals. Where that's coming in? I know you guys are making some efforts to keep some of the truckload business out of the network. But obviously, a strong overall freight environment right now. So kind of just curious if you give us a little bit of color, how those numbers are trending? Greg Gantt : Yes. That was probably long winded in my initial response. But we're coming right in where we would want to be and consistent with how we've trended over many years, because we've had a long term consistent process. And we've averaged an increase in our revenue per shipment of about 4.5%. And that is a target over our cost inflation of 75 to 100 basis points. So, certainly the strong demand when you've got a yield management process that focuses on individual account profitability. In a demand environment like this, we've got to think about opportunity costs with how we allocate capacity. And certainly when you've got accounts that may not be the best performing from an operating ratio standpoint, then we try to work through those as those accounts may be asking for more capacity from us. And so, certainly would try to get a little more in an environment like this when we may not be able to get as much in environments that are a little bit weaker. But core increases are going well. We're seeing good increases as the contracts are coming up. But that's what we shoot for year-in and year-out. We think have a differentiated approach where we tried to be consistent year-in and year-out with our customers and talk about the cost inflation that we're experiencing, and the increases that we need to offset that inflation. But again, also supporting the continuous investment and capacity that we're making on behalf of our customers. So that's all going well, right now, and certainly the environment is very supportive of our pricing initiatives this year. Chris Wetherbee : Yes. Certainly seems like the case. And then just picking up on what you just mentioned in terms of the capacity additions, and maybe some of the real estate opportunities that you guys are looking at this year. Are those becoming more challenging? Is it difficult to continue to sort of keep that sort of physical footprint capacity growth in line with what you'd want it to be just given obviously, a very strong demand environment that we're seeing, but obviously, sort of tightness in kind of across the base and commercial, industrial real estate. Just kind of curious how you guys are seeing that process playing out? And do you see any maybe potential inflation creeping into those numbers? Or you okay with where you are? Greg Gantt : Chris, that's a great question. I think if you recall, we've talked a lot about that over the last several years. And it is definitely more difficult and much more challenging today to increase that brand on the real estate side than it used to be. But, we've worked extremely hard at it. We've got a very active real estate department that is searching where we know, we have needs, and we're trying to anticipate our needs as best we can. We're doing that. And we're having some success. And I've mentioned it in the past, there are some parts of the country that are much more difficult than others. And you just have to work harder at it for those places than you do in some of the other middle of the country type more rural areas. So, again, I think we're having the success that we need, be it more difficult, and it's obviously, it's more expensive. Thank you. You heard our numbers. We're talking about the $300 million real estate capital expenditure budget this year. And a lot of that is because of the inflation that we've seen related to real estate. So it's not -- certainly if we were doing this year of what we did maybe 10, 15 years ago, the number wouldn't be anywhere near that. So there's definitely some inflation there. But again, we're having success. I feel good about it. It's just a little more costly than it used to be. And certainly you have to work harder at it. Chris Wetherbee : Yes. Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate the time this morning. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Chappell from Evercore. Please go ahead. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Greg, you'd mentioned I think, an answer to one of the earlier questions about limiting some of the TL business out of your network. And we're certainly seeing a lot of headlines on some traditional TL tonnage going into the LTL. networks. Can you -- is there any way to quantify how much of your tonnage growth has been what you would consider kind of traditional TL? And then also, what's the stickiness of this freight? Is that something that comes on for the time being to the extent that you'll enable it to come on in and you can get a better price for that? Or is that something that you can actually turn on a longer duration, maybe contractual basis to add to your growth? Greg Gantt : It's not sticky at all, Jon. That business is about a slippery as it gets. It'll move between truckload and LTL depending on the capacity that the truckload market has at the time. So it's very slippery. It comes and goes. And that's why, we certainly don't want to load our network down with truckload type shipments when we certainly feel like we've got obligations to service our normal regular LTL type business. So we will continue to try to manage that as long as we have a need to manage it. So, as far as -- how much that amounts to? I don't know, Adam, you probably got a better feel for that than I do. Adam Satterfield : Yes. It's been something where a lot of those shipments end up coming through our spot quote network and spot quote type business and other volume shipments. And in the past have been anywhere from 3% to 5% of our revenue. Right now, they're probably only 1% to 2% of revenue. So, we certainly have seen a decrease. Now, with that said, some of those -- some shippers, especially the larger accounts, when our weight per shipment increased last year, they just move heavier type shipments on their contractual rates. So some of that is transparent to us that a customer may have tried to move 6,000 pounds shipment by a truckload, if they could have found a carrier that may have performed a multi stop for them. So, it's not always clear. But what's clear is just us trying to understand all of the freight movement characteristics, the costing for each shipment, and the revenue that we need to have on each shipment that we move. Jon Chappell : Now, that makes sense. And then as a follow-up and a follow-up to Chris is, in early February, you've mentioned plans to open two to three terminals in 1Q, hopefully, six or so through the rest of the year. And then just given some of those commercial real estate challenges, and Greg, your comment on having to work harder. You get to the point where maybe you look outside of organic growth, and there's kind of inorganic ways to make up for some of that growth at a time when most of your competitors are standing still, if not even contracting? Greg Gantt : Jon, no, we -- like I said, we're having success in the service centers that we've got planned for this year. They're well underway. They're not at the point where we're trying to find real estate and build. If we've talked about opening four, six or whatever it is, you can be sure those are well underway, or we wouldn't be talking about them. We do have a lot of places that we're still acquiring real estate and making plans and whatnot. But those are well underway. And again, as we talked about before, we feel like there's a lot of growth opportunity left in the -- on the LTL side. And that's what we're trying to do. That's what we've talked about now for years. That's our plan. That's our strategy. And we'll continue to execute on that going forward. Jon Chappell : Great. Thank you, Greg. Thanks, Adam. Operator : We'll take the next question. At this time, it comes from Todd Fowler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Todd Fowler : Great. Thanks and good morning. I know you've touched on this kind of a couple different ways throughout the call. But thinking about the weight per shipment right now at around 1600 pounds, it's down from where it was in the second quarter of last year. But it's still above where you had been trending in 2017 and 2018, and even into 2019. So how do we think about kind of your freight basket? Is it kind of back to pre-pandemic levels? Are there still pockets that have customers that haven't come back? Or is there any shifts that are happening within the mix to see the weight per shipment works out right now? Adam Satterfield : I think that, the 1600 pound range, where we are, I think really reflects the strength of the economy, typically an increase in weight per shipment goes hand in hand with an improving economy. And to think about what I just mentioned, with the decrease in the number of spot quote shipments, oftentimes a spot quote shipments are averaging 8,000 to 10,000 pounds. So when you've got that mix of business that has now shifted into a percentage of business rather than shifted into our 559 tariff base customers and our larger contractual customers, I think it just reflects the underlying demand for our customers businesses. But we've seen really good performance with our smaller accounts. In recent months, our tariff based business is continuing to improve as a result and actually is trending slightly ahead as a percent of overall revenue than where we were pre pandemic. And then our contractual accounts, which performed well for us all last year, continuing to perform strongly as well. And so they actually are, are picking up a little bit more as well. And we're just seeing the higher balance in both of those categories versus that decrease in the mix from the spot quote. So it's good to see across the board, that when we look at our accounts, and think through that the increase in weight per shipment kind of goes hand in hand with the feedback that we're getting from our sales team that our customers businesses are improving. And there's just the increased demand for widgets out there that's creating freight opportunities for us. And certainly, we're taking advantage of that opportunity with our market share improvements. Todd Fowler : Yes. Okay, Adam. That makes sense. So it sounds like that the mix is normalized. And the change in weight per shipment is more a function of the economy at this point then kind of big shifts in the customer base right now? Greg Gantt : Yes. Todd Fowler : Okay. And then just to follow up. Do you care to share kind of any expectations around headcount growth, either sequentially into the second quarter, or kind of what your thought process would be for the full year. I know you shared some expectations in the first quarter, obviously, sounds like you're trying to catch up and ramp up on the headcount side. So if you have any kind of overall numbers, that would be great? And then also thoughts around productivity. I think that historically, maybe it's been six to nine months to get new employees up to a level of efficiency of more experienced hires. Is that kind of the right way we should think about this cycle? Are there any things that would impact that? Thanks. Greg Gantt : On the average headcount side, in the first quarter, initially, we were up 4.3% versus fourth quarter. And typically, our headcount is pretty flat. So there was a big increase and shift there, and reflect on the success and the programs that Greg mentioned. Our HR team has done a really great job of continuing to bring people on board and get them ready for the acceleration and freight that we typically see through the second and third quarters. An average second quarter headcount is normally up a little over 2% for us. The biggest year we ever had was in 2014, again another strong period. Headcount was up 5%, that year, in the second quarter. And I think we're going to see probably a number more like that. We're still trying to catch the curve, if you will, with the growth that we're seeing. And still having to make use of some purchase transportation is mentioned. So we would expect to see that we're on the high end of that scale, and possibly even exceeding that, on that 5% metric in terms of the sequential change from first quarter, second quarter. And the productivity that you mentioned, like we mentioned, our prepared remarks, especially on the dock, it's pretty typical to see a loss of productivity. But it's certainly more important to make sure that the team is they come in new, they're learning, they learn our ways for claims prevention. They're following our safety protocols and so forth. And, and we're trying to maximize the loads that we're moving our line-haul costs, they're the biggest cost element that we face. So we've got to make sure that that we're properly loading these trailers to maximize the overall efficiency of the operation. And so certainly, that's something that we'll continue to experience is we're increasing headcount. But when we've got the top line revenue growth, that gives us a little covered offset, maybe some of this higher cost inflation that we're seeing. Todd Fowler : Yes, understood. Thanks for the time this morning, guys. Operator : We'll pick the next question. At this time. It comes from Ari Rosa from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ari Rosa : Hi. Good morning, Greg, and Adam. Nice quarter. So, for my first question, I wanted to ask about salaries and benefits line. It was the best quarter as a percent of revenue that it's been in a number of years as far as I can tell. And I know last year, you had some special bonus payments, that it sounds like probably won't be recurring this year. And if I look at average salaries and benefits expense per employee, it took a step down sequentially. And I assume that's related to some new hiring, which presumably is coming in at slightly lower wages. So I guess my question is, when I think about comp per employee, can it stay in this range sequentially? Or does it take a little bit of a step up, given some of the wage inflation pressures that we're seeing and some of the challenges that other LTL carriers have spoken about with regard to hiring? Greg Gantt : I think going back to just pure comp per employee, again, we gave the wage increase last year of between 3% to 3.5%. I think that when you start looking at things on a year-over-year basis, all of the comparisons in the second quarter are going to be pretty unusual. But we're going to have higher costs related to group health and dental benefits. I think that we'll see our benefit cost per employee, some acceleration there. As we progress, we have pretty good performance. So those fringe benefit cost as a percent of normal salaries and wages in the first quarter were 33%, 33.2%. And so, that was good performance. We were anticipating somewhere more like 34% for this year, 34% to 34.5% was kind of my initial forecast. And so, saw good performance there. I think that possible that we'll continue to see some inflation there. The other factor is, we're certainly seeing inflation, when it comes to the performance based compensation that we have. With our improving financial results, we're going to see increases there as well. And that's something that really gets back to when we talk about our focus for hiring people. It all starts with our company culture and the family spirit that we have. That certainly has made it easier to both attract and retain employees. But the connection to the financial performance, and that direct link of the engagement of employees with connecting the company's financial success to their personal success through improved wages and benefits and contributions into our 401-K retirement program. Those are all things that helped keep driving the performance of the company. So those will continue to increase as the financial performance, both revenue and income are increasing as well. But I think we're in a great spot. And to keep getting some leverage. If we see that salary, wages and benefits line, there should be some natural inflation there too, is we in-source, and reduce our reliance on purchase transportation. So there shouldn't be some corresponding decreases once we kind of catch back up to the curve there. So multiple factors that's going to be driving that number for us. Ari Rosa : Got it. Understood. That's very helpful. And then just my second question, you'd mentioned this -- that'll give 25% available capacity. Obviously, that implies a lot of room to grow. And as I think about the step up and CapEx that's expected. Kind of maybe if you can help contextualize what that 25% available capacity means, in terms of your ability to grow sequentially from these levels? I think a lot of transport companies spoke about first quarter being a little bit challenging given weather related obstacles to moving freight. As we think about -- forget the year over year comparisons, but just sequentially from here. How much room is there to kind of outgrow what the normal sequential pattern has been? Greg Gantt : That 25% reflects the door capacity that we have in our network. In an LTL network, it's the doors that is required to process freight. And it's obviously very critical and a long term investment and a long time to expand capacity, as we've discussed earlier on the call. So, that's something that we always have to stay focused on. And we feel like far ahead of our growth curve to make sure the network is never a limiting factor to us. But that's one of three key elements of capacity within LTL. Next would be on the fleet side. And I feel like we're in a really good spot, based on where our fleet is and the ability to handle the freight that we have today, as well as the ongoing increases that we would be anticipating this year. In coordination with the $290 million CapEx spend that we have planned for equipment this year. So I feel like our fleets in a really good spot. And obviously, you don't want to carry that much excess capacity like we do on the service center network side in your fleet, there's higher deer depreciation per unit cost there. You want to have enough to be able to handle the peaks at the end of the month and the end of quarters and to be able to accommodate growth. But you don't maintain that same excessive level. And then finally, and most importantly, is the people capacity. And certainly, that's something that we manage more in relation with revenue and volume trends. And it's something that we're constantly balancing here. And the lever we pull, like we're pulling right now, when we're a little short is we make use of purchase transportation. And we'll continue to do that until we complete the additions to the team that just sort of catch up with the freight volumes that we're currently experiencing. So, we're in a good spot across the board. And I think we've got a good plan, a very detailed plan and is different by service center and by region for how we're continuing to add drivers and platform employees to the team to continue to handle the accelerating volumes that we're seeing. Ari Rosa : Okay, understood. Thanks for the time. Operator : We'll take the next question. Now, it comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Morning, guys. Adam, can you just talk about the impact of higher fuel and what it means for top line, bottom line incremental margin this year? Adam Satterfield : Well, obviously, from a top line basis, it's finally going to be turning for us, in the sense of for most of last year we faced the headwind with fuel prices being down in March. It turned if you will. And at this point, we're looking at fuel prices that are about 25% or so higher than where they were in April of last year. So that'll be a good thing from a top line standpoint for us. From a bottom line standpoint, much like we talked about last year, we tried to have our fuel scales, both for our own internal scale, as well as the scales that many of our larger contractual accounts have within their contracts to be somewhat neutral, whether fuel is going up or down, and we stress test those. But we didn't really talk too much about it. Last year, we felt -- when it was decreasing, we felt like, we would minimize the effect on the bottom line, based on the lower end of the fuel scales. And certainly now that it's showing a year over year increase, we'd hope to minimize the effect on the bottom line as well. But just keep managing through that on a customer by customer basis. And looking at what the revenue inputs are, and the cost inputs are to maximize profitability. Scott Group : Okay. And then just a longer term question. What if anything, are you guys doing as relates to electric and autonomous trucks? Do you see any use cases for either over the next five years or so? Greg Gantt : Yes. Sure, Scott. We were actually in the process of making a couple purchases to do some testing. We still from everything we see and hear that technology is not where it needs to be to help us at this point, but we are wanting to test some electric vehicles. Be it switchers, be it trucks or -- and/or forklifts. So that's in the process as we speak. But, again, I don't see any impact of that in the near future. Scott Group : And autonomous? Greg Gantt : Any impact I'm saying from electric. Yes. On the electric side, right? Adam Satterfield : Yes. On the autonomous piece, that's something that we feel like that technology is continuing to develop, and we'll continue to look at things. From a regulatory standpoint. I don't know that we ever, it's hard to envision seeing the driverless vehicle on the road, sharing the roadways with passenger autos. But we think that as the technology improves, that it will continue to drive improvements in safety. And certainly could drive some incremental benefit as well. But the technology may get there before it's really allowed from a regulatory standpoint. But something that we'll continue to watch. And obviously is, I think we've got one of the youngest fleets in the industry and are investing year in and year out, we always want to look at whatever safety or efficiency tools are available to us. And we've got the financial strength and ability to invest as those become available, and we feel like are practical to implement within our operation and certainly would be on board with taking advantage of whatever opportunities the manufacturers can come up with. Scott Group : Thank you guys. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please go ahead. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good morning. So I have two questions for you. One, you commented about the very strong, I think is that, I don't know 45%, 50% revenue per day growth in April. Are the comps much different in May, in June? Or do you think that commentary on April kind of could be representative of the quarter? Greg Gantt : April, was definitely the worst period that we experienced last year. That was the biggest drop that was just like freight and revenue levels fell off a cliff. And once things reset, we had pretty good recovery and sequentially increases for the most part that point forward. But from a revenue trend standpoint, in April, we were down 19.3% on a per day basis, like I mentioned in May, we were down -- May of 2020, we were down 16.2%. In June of 2020, we were down 11.5%. So each month, the change -- I guess the comp gets a little more difficult, but just reflects sequential improvements that we saw. Overall revenue for the quarter was down 15.5% second quarter of 2020. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. That's good. That's helpful. Thank you. Greg, if I look back at periods when you've had kind of peak as tonnage growth, it seems like you've gotten a couple times up to maybe 15% year over year tonnage growth. Is that possible you achieve that this year? I mean, you've got obviously a super easy compare in second quarter. And then you talk about the 25% door capacity. But obviously, you got the other two elements that Adam highlighted. So, is it feasible to get to a mid teens type of tons growth this year? Or is it hard to achieve for people or trucks or whatever? Greg Gantt : 15% tonnage, Tom, that's pretty steep. I'm not sure I recall those days. Maybe my memory seems. But we had 15 in 2018. But anyway, that's a pretty steep. We'll see it obviously, in the second quarter when we were so far back in 2020. But I'm not sure once we get back to normal type comparisons, we're going to see that kind of growth, that's probably a stretch. And to be clear, on that percent capacity, that's not a year over year growth. I mean, that's, that's capacity from the freight levels that we're handling here in March in the first quarter. Incremental growth on top of that, while we're also continuing to expand every day. Tom Wadewitz : When you say that's hard to achieve, I think you did it in 2014, and 2018, you're probably close in 10 and 11. Is it just people, Greg, or what's the reason that that you couldn't do or it'd be tough to do 15%? Greg Gantt : It's hard to ramp up, Tom at that pace. I mean, obviously, if we knew we were anticipating that. If that was realistic, then it would certainly be more realistic, but I'm not sure, we'll see that those type numbers. I'm not sure the economy's quite that strong. While things are certainly good and positive. That 15% is a bit over where we are today.  Got to remember right, we just came off the rim. I just wanted to mention, reiterate, we came off the highest revenue quarter we've ever had in the first quarter. So you're talking about big numbers, bigger numbers on top of big numbers, if you will. And he's in obviously ignoring the year over year column. That's much easier Again, second quarter, we'll have some impressive numbers. I would certainly expect. But we get in the, like I say, more normal comparisons. I don't think we'll see that. The first and fourth quarters are more normalized versus the middle part of the year, where we've got some easier comps. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, great. That's helpful. Congratulations on the great quarter. Greg Gantt : Thanks, Tom. Operator : We'll take the next question that comes from Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jordan Alliger : Alright. Yes. Just sort of big picture question. With all the strength in LTL, as you mentioned, obviously pricings freight demand is extremely strong. Given what you're doing from a capacity standpoint, or with your cap spending. I mean, is there some concern, or is there some -- I mean, you see the industry trying to add capacity broadly, it not just the potential public guys, but sort of, maybe, the private LTL players too? Is there a broad scramble to increase industry capacity right now? Greg Gantt : I don't know that we've seen that. Jordan, I don't know that we've seen that at all. I expect some of them are trying to do something. But we haven't seen a whole lot of movement for the most part. We see -- every now and again, you'll see some carriers adding a terminal here and there. But like I mentioned earlier, when we look over a longer period of time, the reality is, there's been more of a decrease in the number of service centers in operation around the country versus we obviously have been focused on increasing. And we're doing that because of the market share opportunities that we continue to believe that are out there. And certainly we're positioned better than anyone with the service levels that we offer, the total value proposition. And we feel like that in this environment, more shippers are focusing on value, that's certainly what we sail. And there is a value to Old Dominion services, as well as the capacity. Our customers right now are certainly benefiting from the fact that we've made all of these capacity investments and they've got contracts in place with us. And we certainly can continue to handle increased levels of business with them. And we're getting the feedback from customers that many of our competitors are not able to handle some of the acceleration that they're seeing in their business. So that, too, is we have seen in the first quarter. And that's continuing where that capacity advantages is certainly driving freight our way. So anecdotally, feedback that we're getting from customers as well as just what we see in terms of total service centers and operation, on average, they are down. And we are benefiting from that at a time when we think the industry continues to have tailwinds. And that's just creating more and more opportunity for Old Dominion. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Once again, Greg, your initial comments on market share, I don't think I've heard you sound as explicit or as aggressive on the share gain opportunity as you did, which is obviously great to hear. But can you just kind of unpack that a little bit. Is that something to do with the kind of structural changes in the industry you seen in the last couple of quarters? Do you feel like some of your competitors are more vulnerable? Is it a function of the cycle where it is? Is it some kind of internal change and go-to-market strategy or messaging? Kind of what drove that? Greg Gantt : I don't think it's a change in strategy at all. Its this the strategy we've been talking about for a long time. And like I've mentioned before, and we've talked about over the years, we will grow more when the economy is strong. And when our competitors capacity is as limited as it appears to be, then the customers come to us. And that's what we've seen happening in recent months. And I expect that we will certainly have much stronger growth than most all of our competitors. So, we're waiting to see, but it's not any anything that we've done, the change. Is just the continued execution of the strategy that we set forth back some years ago. And like I said, before, we're executing and having success doing so. I feel good about where we are and the things that we've done. And now its the time when it starts to pay off for us. Yes. Pretty positive from that standpoint, for sure. Ravi Shanker : Understood. And if I can follow up on the on the labor question, which you hit a few times. And I think you even hit the autonomous truck question ones, but if I can just keep on that topic. What's the opportunity for automation on some of the other kind of labor parts of the business kind of on the dock and the terminal side, rather than the autonomous driving side, which I think it should be here in rightly shorter? Greg Gantt : I assume you're talking about robots and that kind of thing? Ravi Shanker : Yes. I'm saying, have you done any studies? Or is there any opportunity at all to increase kind of automation on yes, things like robotic, forklifts or things like that, that can help you load the trucks and reduce the need for labor intensity there? Greg Gantt : Not that we've seen. Not at this point in time. Ravi Shanker : Okay. Got it. Thank you Operator : There are no more questions in the queue. And I'd like to turn it back over to you for any closing remarks. Greg Gantt : Thank you. Thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions. Please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thank you and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir. Greg Gantt : Thank you, good morning and welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. The OD team produced another record breaking quarter and established new company records for quarterly revenues, operating ratio and earnings per diluted share. While the comparison of our numbers with the second quarter of 2020 is somewhat skewed due to the impact of the pandemic related shutdowns last year, our second quarter business momentum this year helped to drive the improvement in our revenue and profitability. Our revenue grew 47.2% to $1.3 billion and our operating ratio improved 550 basis points to 72.3%. As a result, our earnings per diluted share grew 84.8% to $2.31. We achieved these results by continuing to execute on our long-term strategic plan. This plan has guided us through many economic cycles and it is currently driving impressive growth in this strong market. Two key elements of this plan are delivering superior service at a fair price and consistently investing in capacity to help ensure that our network is never a limiting factor to our growth. We often discussed our unwavering commitment to providing our customers with superior service. This quarter, I would like to offer a deeper dive into how we think about capacity given its relevance to the current environment. There are three major elements of capacity within LTL, doors at our service center, our equipment and our people. Doors can be the most limiting form of capacity in the short-term, which is why we try to stay several years ahead of our anticipated growth curve. We have invested $1.7 billion in our service center network over the past 10 years, which has allowed us to expand our door count by over 50%. Our current capital expenditure plan includes $275 million to further expand the capacity of our service center network, but we are willing to spend even more if we identify properties that are included in our long-term plan. Our commitment to the ongoing expansion of our service center network is important regardless of the macroeconomic environment due to the strong returns on capital for our business. We have consistently invested in the Old Dominion's expansion even in years when our market share trends have been flattish. Due to the confidence we have in our long-term market share potential, although expanding the capacity of service centers takes a significant amount of time, demand trends can change very quickly in our industry, which is why we have historically been proactive with respect to our expansion efforts. This unique strategy has created a large capacity advantage for us in the marketplace, which becomes most apparent to shippers and tight environments like this year. We estimate that we currently have 15% to 20% excess capacity within our service center network and we expect to open several new facilities during the second half of this year. As a result, the capacity of our overall service in our network is in good shape. Although we continue to focus on the needs of certain locations to help ensure, we are keeping up with increased opportunities for growth. We are prepared to address these needs as well as any other elements of capacity that need to be expanded, as it appears that current demand trends will continue into 2022. We believe the domestic economy is strengthening for both our industrial and retail related customers and we expect additional growth in volumes based on current economic forecast as well as customer feedback. We also continue to see accelerating trends with our revenue. We have exceeded a normal sequential trend for each quarter since the cliff event that affected the second quarter of 2020. This outperformance has continued with our month-to-date revenue for July 2021 as well. While we feel good about our service center network, we have faced challenges with the other elements of capacity this year. There've been some delays with equipment deliveries that have caused us to continue to operate older units that were intended to be replaced. We're fortunate to have this as an option due to the fact that we are one of the youngest fleets in our industry. While our suppliers are somewhat behind schedule, we do believe that we will receive each unit that we have ordered this year. These new units will supplement our current pool of equipment and are expected to satisfy our equipment needs through the second half of this year. The capacity of our people continues to be our biggest need to support ongoing growth. We were successful during the second quarter with our hiring efforts and actually exceeded our goal for the period. We added over 1,100 full-time employees between March and June, and we expect to add another 1,000 full-time employees during the third quarter of this year. We will continue to use third party purchase transportation to supplement the capacity of our people and our fleet until those two elements of capacity catch up with the growth in our volumes. Regardless of whether it is our employees and equipment or a third-party moving the freight, we remain focused on providing best-in-class service to our customers. As I previously said, providing superior service at a fair price and having capacity to stay ahead of our growth curve are two key pillars to our long-term strategic plan. The centerpiece of our plan though remains our people. Our OD Family of employees is committed to servicing our customers, while also growing our business. As a result, we believe we are better positioned than any other carrier to take advantage of the opportunity for further profitable growth and increase shareholder value over the long-term. Thank you for joining us this morning and now Adam will discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue growth of 47.2% in the second quarter included a 28.1% increase in LTL tons and a 14.9% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 10.3% reflecting success of our yield improvement initiatives as well as changes in the mix of our freight. While the growth in our revenue and volumes reflects an easier comparison with the second quarter of 2020, the sequential acceleration in our revenue during the second quarter was once again well above normal sequential trends. On a sequential basis second quarter LTL shipments per day increased 12.1% over the first quarter of 2021 as compared to a 10-year average sequential increase of 7.6%. LTL tons per day increased 9.7% as compared to a 10-year average sequential increase of 7.9%. These 10-year average trends exclude our 2020 metrics for more normalized comparison. While both our shipments and tons outperformed our long-term averages, the discrepancy between our shipment and tonnage trends as a result of the decrease in our LTL weight per shipment. We have made operational changes over the past few quarters, mainly through pricing actions to limit the number of heavy weighted and larger harder-to-handle types of shipments in our network that are typically more transactional in nature. We increase these efforts during the second quarter, given the ongoing tightness in our industry to preserve capacity for our customers, traditional LTL shipments. At this point in July with only a few days remaining in the month, our revenue per day is trending higher by approximately 35% when compared to July 2020. The year-over-year revenue comparison gets tougher for us in the third quarter, as our revenue per day turned positive in August 2020 and increased overall for the third quarter of 2020. We will provide actual revenue related details for July in our second quarter Form 10-Q. The operating ratio for the second quarter improved 550 basis points to a company record 72.3% with improvement in both our direct operating costs and overhead expenses as a percent of revenue. This improvement was essentially in line with the target we discussed on our first quarter earnings call. Overhead related costs as a percent of revenue improved 490 basis points due primarily to the operating leverage created by the quality of our revenue growth. Much of the overall improvement in overhead as a percent of revenue related to our depreciation and wage and benefit costs for ourselves and administrative employees. Within our direct operating costs, the wage and benefit cost for our driver's, platform employees and fleet technicians improved due primarily to an improvement in the overall efficiency of our operations. This improvement more than offset the increases in operating supplies and expenses, which reflects the rising cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products, as well as the increased utilization of purchase transportation to supplement our workforce. While we will continue to add employees during the second half of this year to support our anticipated growth, we believe we can effectively balance our direct operating cost with revenue as we continue to focus on productivity and ultimately reduce our reliance on purchase transportation. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $198 million and $508.3 million for the second quarter and first half of 2021 respectively, while capital expenditures were $155.1 million and $206.1 million for the same periods. We returned $63.2 million of capital to share folders during the second quarter and utilize $395.4 million of cash through the first half of this year for both our dividend and share repurchase programs. This year-to-date total for share repurchases include $68.8 million that is deferred until the third quarter when the final settlement occurs on our current accelerated share repurchase agreement. We announced this morning that our Board has approved a new share repurchase program that provides us with the authorization to repurchase up to $2 billion of our outstanding stock. We intend to fund this program with cash flows from operations and existing cash to continue our focus of returning excess capital to our shareholders. Our first priority for capital spending, however, will continue to be strategic investments in capital expenditures to support the long-term profitable growth of our business. Our annual effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 26% as compared to 25.7% in the second quarter of 2020, and we currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the third floor. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator will be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead. Jack Atkins : Okay, Greg, good morning, and Greg, Adam, congrats on a great quarter. Greg Gantt : Thanks, Jack. Adam Satterfield : Thanks, Jack. Jack Atkins : So, I guess, first question, Adam, could you talk about \u2013 you've referenced the July revenue per day being up 35%. How does that compare relative to normal seasonality, you know, from what Greg was saying, it sounds like that's what you're trending above normal seasonality. And then when we think about the operating ratio given we're seeing inflationary cost pressures across the supply chain. You guys are talking about hiring an additional thousand folks in the third quarter. How should we think about operating ratio trends in the third quarter versus the 2Q relative to the normal seasonality, which I think calls for some very modest degradation if I'm thinking about that right? Adam Satterfield : Sure. Yes, on the revenue per day basis, obviously, we've still got a few important days to close out the month, but we're trending very favorably at this point for the month of July. And our revenue per day at this point is a little bit stronger than what our normal sequential trends would indicate and it really just follows the pattern that we've seen over the last four quarters that we've referenced. We've exceeded normal sequential trends on a quarterly basis, and really see no reason at this point why that would change as we go into the third quarter. It's \u2013 the market continues to be really tight, the feedback that we're getting from customers. We just continue to see the service advantage and capacity advantage that we have in the marketplace is winning share for us. And so, we're trying to do all the things as we referenced in our prepared remarks to continue to prepare for further growth and to provide best-in-class service to our customers. So we'll continue to do all those elements to get prepared. And as we get through the balance of this year and really continue to try to position the company for 2022. With respect to the margin question, we typically see about a 50 basis point increase in the operating ratio from the second to the third quarter. And I think that we'll see somewhere in that same ballpark 50 to 70 basis points maybe, so kind of flattish as we go from the second quarter, are consider that flattish. But just a slight increase we typically see and have our wage increase is effective the 1st of September. We're a little behind schedule on some of our equipment deliveries as Greg mentioned as well. So that means that we'll have a little bit more depreciation hitting us in the third quarter than typically where it would have been loaded into the first half of the year. So a few factors like that that may come on board, but certainly continuing to see strength as we work our way into the third quarter. Jack Atkins : Okay. That's all very helpful, Adam. Thank you. And I guess maybe for my second question, more of a bigger picture, longer-term question, but there are a lot of just concerns among investors with sustainability of the freight market and trends and obviously you guys are expecting the current strength in the market to continue well into 2022, if I'm quoting you correctly. But the investments you're making in your business should position you to take market share. And I think when you look at the market more broadly, how are you thinking about secular growth within LTL, given its leverage, increasing leverage to e-commerce and the importance of e-commerce middle-mile e-commerce demand to overall LTL growth over the next several years. Could you maybe talk about that for a moment, Greg? Because it seems like that's something that could really lift a tonnage in the broader LTL industry and you guys are in a great position to capitalize on that. Greg Gantt : Sure, Jack. No question about it. I mean, the e-commerce has continued to grow as everybody knows and we've benefited from that as well as some of our competitors, but it's strong. I'm not sure I see any change in that if anything continued growth especially with changes that we've had with the COVID and how people continue to stay at home and work from home and those kinds of things. I think that have continued to drive some of the e-commerce and the middle-mile business that we've enjoyed in the last period of time \u2013 over the last period of time, so definitely strong, getting stronger. And I think, like I mentioned before, with all the investments that we continue to make and positioning ourselves to have capacity and to be able to do the things that some of our competitors can't because of it, I think we're in a good position, Jack. Jack Atkins : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore. Please go ahead. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning everybody. Greg, kind of continuing on that theme, if my notes are correct, last quarter, you said you had about 25% to 30% excess capacity in your network for growth and today you said 15% to 20%. Are you pushing up against the limits of where you're more actively going out to try to take share to keep around that 15% kind of a just in case excess capacity? Or do you still feel that you could be more aggressive as it goes out with pricing and trying to take share in the back half of the year? Greg Gantt : So, I can tell you, we won't be aggressive and take share with price. We've never, we've never used that strategy and certainly don't intend to do that in this market that we're in today. As you know we're extremely busy as \u2013 the 47% growth, that type of growth, it does take capacity out of your network pretty darn quick, but I will say this we've got some nine \u2013 if I looked at it correctly, we've got nine facilities that we're trying to open in the back half of this year. I'm not sure we'll get all nine of them open, but we will get several of them between now and the end of the year and the other should come early in the 2022. And we have some 1 dozen or 12 service centers where we're adding doors, we're adding door capacity. So, we're working on continuing to grow our capacity just as quickly as we can. And besides that, those are just the projects that are underway that's not counting all the funds that we're trying to accomplish with land purchases and those kinds of things. So we're working to grow it as we speak. It's an ongoing effort. Again, this business that we're facing today, it takes it out pretty darn quick, sometimes it takes it out quicker than you put it back, but we are working on it, like I said, as we speak. Jon Chappell : Okay. And to be clear, I wasn't insinuating you'd be taking share with price. I was hoping that you'd be taking share with capacity and then pricing as efficiently as you have been. Just as the follow-up for Adam. Once again going back to April, you would insinuated that PT hopefully would be down in 2Q, but most likely wouldn't be and it really wasn't, but really expecting it to come down in second half. I know you look at it holistically with wage and benefits as well, and you're adding a thousand people in the third quarter. Is it still likely that PT can come down on a meaningful basis in second half? Or given that capacity shrink and maybe some issues with hiring we should think about PT being maybe a bit more inflated than usual in the second half of the year. Greg Gantt : Yes, I think for the third quarter especially that it's going to stay at an elevated amount, we actually use quite a bit more in the month of June as we've worked through the end of the quarter strength that we typically see there. We actually had to step up our utilization of it somewhat and we expect it to be actually probably a little bit higher in the third quarter than the 3.3% that we used in 2Q. But I think that as we continue to be successful with bringing people on board that we'll be in the position to hopefully through the fourth quarter and as we transition in 1Q of next year to be able to increasingly use our people and our equipment and reduce that reliance. But because of the strength of the top-line, we just had to continue to pull that lever of using the purchase transportation to continue to serve our customers. And so that's certainly something that we can continue to do through the third quarter and \u2013 but ultimately as you know our strategy is to try to have everything in-source from a domestic line haul standpoint and that's where we ultimately want to get back to. So it's just because of the strength of the top-line. We've had to use it a little bit longer through the year than we had originally intended. Jon Chappell : All right, well, it's a good problem to have. Thanks, Adam. Thanks, Greg. Greg Gantt : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please go ahead. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Hi, Greg. Hi, Adam. Good morning gentlemen. I wanted to touch a little bit on freight selectivity in any accessorial charges because one of your competitors who had reported really noted that that helped them out in the quarter. I got a sense that maybe their accessorial charges were sort of not up to market. But just curious, how much do you think that gave you a boost in the quarter and on freight selectivity how much of that is permanent versus just depending upon the market itself? Greg Gantt : Jason, I don't know that we necessarily any competitors actions in terms of new accessorials or changes in accessorials necessarily impacts us, obviously when the pricing environment is strong like it is right now that provides a lift to everyone and supports our own pricing initiatives. But I think we have a differentiated approach to pricing and we've seen that and it's really been the foundation for why we produce such long-term profitable growth. We have a strategy of looking at our cost inflation and then we try to target increases in our revenue per shipment to give us a cost plus pricing. And that formulates the approach every year goes into our general rate increase when we push that out, that goes into what we try to achieve from a contract renewal standpoint as well. With that said each account must stand on its own from an individual profitability standpoint. And so we would look at each account on an individual basis and what the cost inputs are for that particular account and what our pricing needs to look like to provide an appropriate return for us. And I think we've got really good consistency across our book of business. I think we saw that last year in the disruption in particular, in the second quarter when a large percentage of our business shifted to larger national accounts. And I think there was a concern by some on the street about what that would do to margins. And we went through the second quarter of last year with a 15% decrease in revenue, a change in mix of our business, but we were able to still improve our operating ratio with the pricing actions and the cost control measures that we had in place as well. So we're going to stick to our long-term consistent approach and continue to push for cost plus pricing because it's important for us to continue to expand our capacity. We're one of the few carriers that that really has invested over the long-term. As Greg mentioned this morning, we've invested and expanded our door count over the last 10 years by over 50%. And that supported about a 50% improvement in shipments per day over that same timeframe. So we're uniquely positioned to continue to gain share in a market that that continues to somewhat at least from the reports we get on the public carriers, the number of service centers over that 10 year period have stayed about the same or reduced slightly. So it's a good spot for us to being and to continue to take advantage of opportunity. Certainly, we're going to do it with price, but we should see the volumes come through and improve density as well. And as you know that density and yield formula produces long-term improvement in our operating ratio. And so, we've got further room to improve from where we are today. Jason Seidl : Well, you guys have clearly been the best at that density and yield formula over my career. I wanted to get back to the excess capacity. And you said obviously 15% to 20% is in the network right now that obviously doesn't include any of the nine facilities that you're targeting to add in back half of the year. If we look on a historic basis, sort of what's the lowest that number has ever been in terms of excess capacity? Greg Gantt : Oh gosh, Jason, I am \u2013 you'd have to go way back. I think there was maybe a point in time and I'm going way back some 20 plus years when we probably had very little capacity. But if you \u2013 I don't know how long you followed us exactly, But\u2026 Jason Seidl : 22 years. Greg Gantt : 22, well, that's probably about when we really ramp it up, really it was in the early 2000s. We really ramped up our efforts to start expanding our capacity and it's kind of been ongoing since then really. So I don't know that we really measured it or talked about it if we did. I don't recall it back then, but I can tell just from being here, it was extremely minimal, how about that\u2026 Jason Seidl : Okay. Well, I guess, what the question I'm trying to get at is there's a certain amount of excess capacity that you probably want in your network. Otherwise, you sort of get diseconomies of scale and things have become tight and your operations might suffer if you're operating at a 105% or something like that in jamming freight through the network. So what's that number \u2013 what's a comfortable number to get down to, obviously, 20% is probably too much capacity and it will allows you to grow, but what's a comfortable level on an operational basis to keep up sort of your service metrics for the clients? Greg Gantt : Jason, let me say this. We talked about the 15% to 20% or 20% to 25%. We talked about those numbers really for your benefit. To tell you the truth that's not necessarily how we look at it. We look at it on a need basis. We look at where we know that we're outgrowing our capacity, and those are the places that we try to address first. Now, obviously when we expand the location or build a new location, whatever, we're building capacity and we know, okay, we're 50%, 70%, 80% of capacity in that place. And we'll roll it up to come up with the number for you guys. But honestly, we look at it on a case by case basis. We look at it on a market by market basis where we're busting at the seams and where we're growing and maybe where we've \u2013 we just haven't done quite the job from a marketing standpoint or from a sales standpoint. We know we're on the low side and we know we can improve in those markets. And those are the ones that we target for growth or for expansion, if you will. So I hope that makes sense and I hope that answers your question. Jason Seidl : No, it does. It makes a lot of sense and I appreciate the time as always gentlemen. Greg Gantt : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good morning. Just going back to the question on purchase transportation, could you maybe tell us what percent of your line haul that you're currently outsourcing? And if that's changed over the last couple of quarters and maybe remind us what it's been historically, and when you think you'll be able to bring most of that back in-house? Adam Satterfield : Allison, we don't necessarily track in firms of number of dispatches. I mean, we see how many we're utilizing and then what thoughts and are selective with where we're doing it, but the baseline purchase transportation that we have that is our Canadian operation and truckload brokerage primarily usually runs about 2.2% thereabouts of revenue. So we're up about a full operating point on that, about 110 basis points or so, and, like I said, I think that may go up slightly, maybe 3.5%, 3.7% or so in the third quarter as we continue to utilize it, but we're making our efforts every day, every driver that we can find, we're bringing in and onboarding and continuing to put in place. But it's overall a very small percentage of dispatches that we have that are being outsourced. Allison Landry : Okay, that's helpful. And then, I mean, obviously there has been some notable transactions in the LTL space by some PL carriers. Just curious to get your thoughts on any potential implications whether that's from a pricing standpoint or perhaps it will move up some terminal availability for you and maybe if you think there's the potential for further industry consolidation or M&A. Thank you. Adam Satterfield : It's something that at least from the early indications of what's been pointed out on the street of the few transactions each one has talked about increasing pricing to improve margins. So, again, that's something that will certainly help with our pricing initiatives if you've got every other carrier that's going out and trying to raise rates. So we'll see if there are any other transactions, certainly the market is very consolidated as you know and we don't expect any new entrance in terms of just the new carrier, it's any changes have been new players by way of acquisition. So we'll continue to watch and see how some of the new owners manage those other businesses. And in the meantime, if that creates right opportunity for us, that's typically what we see is that becomes a little freight churn, and we either get freight directly, or in some cases just indirectly as the churn within the industry happens, but we will continue to work with our customers. And if we're a common carrier with a customer that has got one of these other entities, our sales team is always in there trying to identify freight opportunities for us. And so in some cases that's what creates a market share opportunity for us, but we've got multiple sources of how we win share. And we certainly believe that we've got a long runway for growth ahead of us, and we'll continue to execute on that front. And in regards to service center availability, we haven't necessarily seen anything at this point in terms of reducing the number of service centers for many of the other big public carriers. And certainly, we're \u2013 we've got our eyes out and wouldn't be willing to look at any opportunities because obviously in our long-term plans we continue to have a pretty long list of areas that we want to expand to. So we're at 248 service centers today and think that we've got a list of sort of 35 or 40 locations on our long-term plan that we want to continue to add to the network and support additional market share opportunities for us. And if we have to build them, we will. That's what's been a bigger part of our plan in recent years, but certainly if the existing terminals become available, we'd take advantage of those opportunities as well. Allison Landry : Okay, perfect. Thanks Adam. Adam Satterfield : Thanks, Allison. Operator : The next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Thank you. Good morning, gens. So you guys continue to execute incredibly well in a good market, but I'm a little surprised that you're stepping up the pace of the buyback here. I mean, clearly, that's good to Old Dominion shareholders and that's awesome, but historically you've been at entity that's going to really reinvest it back in the business. Your stock kind of just on consensus numbers right now is not particularly cheap. So what's the messaging there? I mean, do you think that you guys can become the first trucking company to break into the 60s war and so normalized EPS has just significantly higher than current levels, so the stock is much cheaper than we think it is, or what's the messaging there on the buyback step-up? Thanks. Greg Gantt : Well, there is a lot to unpack there, but I'll say this since I started the Old Dominion in 2004, I've heard the story that our stock was expensive and look at where we are today from a stock price standpoint versus where we were back in 2004. So yes, but that's depending on our continued ability to execute on our plan. And from a buyback standpoint, we continued to look at the buyback program and our dividend program in terms of returning excess capital to our shareholders. I think that we'd been clear that our first priority for capital spending is going to be capital expenditures and strategic investments that provide very solid returns on invested capital for us. And we want to continue to grow the business, in some years that will be heavier CapEx in plant. And we've got the flexibility of the buyback program to look at what our capital needs for the business are and to use it more or less in returning excess capital to our shareholders. So we think it's been a good program for us in the past, but again our first priority is to continue to invest for growth. And that's what we've seen over the long-term and that's what we continue to expect. And Greg mentioned that that 50% growth and keep coming back to this. I know we start thinking about short-term trends and things like that, but over the next 10 years we've talked about the past 10, but over the next 10, we continued to expect that the industry would grow above GDP. We continue to have plans to expand our service centers and take advantage of market share opportunities and grow our shipment counts significantly over the next 10 years. So it just takes continued execution of our business model has been successful in the past. And we think that it will continue to be a successful force into the future, producing very strong returns. Ravi Shanker : There are going to be no debate that you've executed so far. Thanks very much, gens. Greg Gantt : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask you a bit about the \u2013 I guess the 2022 view and kind thinking about cycle impacts from truckload spillover. It seems like you're pretty proactive about the pricing and trying to keep the right quality of freight in your system, but how do you think about the potential risk to 2022 tonnage if either freight growth slows down or truckload capacity, if they finally get some traction on drivers, which I know is tough. Do you think of that as a meaningful potential headwind? Or how do you think about just how much truckload spillover effect there may have been in 2021? It just seems like that that could be a meaningful factor. Greg Gantt : Tom, that's a good observation and then the exact reason why we've taken the actions that we have to protect our capacity now to support our customers, traditional LTL shipments, those truckload spillover type shipments that can weigh 8,000 to 10,000 pounds. Typically, we manage those within our spot quote system. Spot quotes for us historically have been somewhere 3% to 5% of our revenue. Right now, it's less than 1% and we've got a truckload brokerage operation that some of our existing customers move into LTL shipments that have these larger opportunities for us. We can put through our truckload brokerage and provide a solution for them, but we want to make sure that we're paying more attention to our traditional LTL shippers that we're protecting our service and capacity for them as we continue to get feedback that they need capacity. Industry capacity is tight. We're hearing that more and more. It started probably a little bit sooner this year than I expected. We thought that we would hear that feedback given what the sequential transit look like for us, but it certainly come to us maybe a little bit sooner at least the panic if you will. And so, we want to make sure that that we're protecting our customers and giving them what they need, but there's no reason for us to tie up capacity with these transactional type loads that are here today and gone tomorrow. We want to make sure that that we're doing the right thing in protecting the market share that we have that will be with us for the long-term. Tom Wadewitz : Right. Okay. So you \u2013 you think you're pretty well protected in terms of risk on truckload spill over going away in 2022, just because of some of the actions you've taken recently. Is that the right way to read it? Greg Gantt : Correct. We've already moved it out essentially of our system as evidenced by that, that reduction in the spot quote type of business that we have. So we feel good about where we are and transitioning into next year and, obviously we have customer conversations every day, but continue to believe that, that there will be ongoing freight opportunity for us with traditional good pain LTL shipments. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. And thank you for that. And then just a follow-up question. Inflation and labor availability is such a big topic these days, and certainly seems to be affecting transports where normally we don't and in a different way. And yet you seem like your \u2013 I don't want to say immune but that that's not having much impact on your business. Is there a bigger wage increase in normal coming potentially related to that? Is there kind of maybe risk of higher dock pay or have you seen some of that come in, or how do you think about that inflation impact on your business or perhaps just the jobs and quality of culture you have are real differentiator that, that helped you. But maybe if you could offer some thoughts on tight labor market and is there an impact or coming impact? Greg Gantt : Yes. Tom, no question. It's a tighter labor market than certainly we're used to. Of course, I've been here for a long time and I don't ever remember that the growth percentages that in the past that we've got today. So it's definitely a bigger challenge than it's ever been, but there is a labor market out there. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks we've had some like it\u2019s a 1,100 in the second quarter, and we planned to continue to hire in the third quarter. There are folks out there; it is more difficult than it's been. And I think I've mentioned that on our last call or two, it's a little harder to acquire people than it used to be, but we're having success. We're working extremely hard at it, and I think I've mentioned that before they're there, you just have to work harder to get them, and that's what we're doing and that's why we have had some success. But as far as the dollars goes, surely we have to respond based on the market. We give a wage increase every year, as Adam mentioned for we given in September and we certainly plan to do that this year and it may possibly be better than it's been in the past. So yes, you have to respond, but, you have to work at where your needs are, you have to work to fix them. So that's what we've been trying to accomplish, but it's an ongoing effort for sure. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, great. Congratulations on the strong results. Appreciate it. Greg Gantt : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks, and good morning. We didn't pick it up in the labor issue. You're adding, I think another thousand in the third quarter, what do you think you sort of quarterly needs might look like beyond that, I guess in fourth quarter, maybe another thousand people. When you think about sort of where the volume is, where your resources are and sort of what's the right numbers or some catch up that's going on right now? Greg Gantt : Well, I think you probably know our peak season is the third quarter particularly in September. So hopefully if we get the folks on board in the third quarter, I would expect those needs to really to level-off into the fourth quarter. The other thing that we have to deal with in the summer months, obviously we have to cover vacations and those kinds of things, so that that pushes your needs up a little quicker too than sometimes you realize. So hopefully we'll see who knows, and this is where the growth goes. If the growth continues to expand and how quick it expands, all those things will make a difference in our needs, but certainly we'll try to respond however we need to. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Now, that's very helpful. I appreciated that. And then just picking up on that growth dynamic, I mean maybe if we take a step back, you guys talk a lot about sort of the longer term opportunity for growth in the business and sort of where you see your share opportunities. If we were to look out three, five years, how much more tonnage you think you sort of should be able to take on over that period of time. Obviously there's some secular dynamics that are benefiting the LTL industry and you guys are certainly taking share, and maybe some of these recent transactions instead of potentially making the landscape a little bit more challenging from a share perspective, as you mentioned; maybe open up some opportunities for you. So I don't know if you could just maybe take a step back and give us a bigger picture perspective on where you think this might go? Greg Gantt : Chris, we haven't necessarily put out any specific targets necessarily for revenue growth and market share, but certainly believe that given the tightness in the industry and generally the lack of investment in service center expansion by the other carriers. And we look at the public group which is about 65% of the overall industry. But we're just not seeing necessarily any significant investment out of that group as a whole, and so that creates more and more market share opportunity for us. So, we're sitting at 10% to 11% market share today and certainly believe that, that we were the biggest winner of market share over the last 10 years and believe we'll be the biggest winner in regards to market share over the next 10. So, however it takes us to get to where we're going we'll see. We haven't \u2013 like I said published that number, but we certainly believe that that the opportunities there we've got the capacity now and intend to continue to invest in capacity ahead of our growth and try to stay a couple of years ahead of the growth curve. So we just don't necessarily want to publish anything specific, I guess, at this point. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That's helpful though. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ari Rosa with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ari Rosa : Hey, good morning guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter. So I wanted to stay on the subject of wage inflation a bit. I think, if I look at compensation per employee it was up about 10% year-over-year and kind of recognizing there were some anomalous things with last quarter, but it was also seems to have taken a pretty big step up sequentially. So I wanted to think about third quarter, and as you think about kind of the wage increase that's planned for September; maybe any kind of indication in terms of how that looks either on a sequential or year-over-year basis. And if there's some kind of targeted measures that you're doing in terms of targeted bonuses or certain geographies where you're really focusing on maybe taking wages up, just some thoughts around that would be helpful? Adam Satterfield : Yes. Just looking at the average salary wages and benefits number that we publish and divide that by the average number of employees can somewhat be skewed if you will. And I think that that's driving some of that quarter-over-quarter increase thinking about the actions that we had to take last year and then the actions that we're taking now, but try to give you a little bit more color. I mean, I can say that when we started this year we talked about our core inflation being somewhere around 4% on a per shipment basis, excluding fuel. And that included the normal 3% to 3.5% increase that, that we give \u2013 that's what we did last September and certainly we will be given an increase. We haven't announced that to employees yet and so I want to hold back on sharing any color before it goes out. But as Greg mentioned we connect the success of the company with our employees, personal financial success and certainly feel that they will be rewarded for their efforts and for how well the company's performing. Looking into the second quarter in particular though, and we kind of expected this we did have an increase in some of our fringe benefit costs over the period that rate \u2013 that fringe rate was quite a bit higher than where it was in the second quarter of last year and quite a bit higher frankly than where we were in the first quarter. And that some of the anomaly that comes along with the growth in employees. Our employees have been working very hard, working more hours and as you add to your employee count, if you got four employees that were working 50 hours a week, and now you've got five that are working 40 that changes the dynamics. The same amount of hours are there to be worked, and the wage looks the same, but you've got the benefit cost for that fifth employee that increases there. So that's something that we've seen historically when we're growing head count that you get a little bit of lag effect with those benefits. And some of that will continue into the third quarter as well. I'd expect that we might have a little bit higher fringe percentage rate than coming into the year. I targeted and believe we'd be somewhere around 34% that is our fringe benefit as a percentage of salaries and wages. We were a little north of that during the second quarter, and I expect this to be a little bit north of that as well as we transitioned into the third. But, we're offsetting those were obviously costs that, that we overcame in 2Q given the strong top line revenue performance and the leverage that creates on other costs. And then we've got the base, a larger base of employees to thereby grow from. So it's all good and it's all included our expectations of being included as we transitioned in 3Q and some of the comments that I made earlier about where we think that that operating ratio might train to. But we will start to see as we get into the back half of this year, that core inflation start looking more on a per segment basis. Like what we'd expected through the first half of the year, it looked a little different. We've actually in the second quarter; our cost per shipment excluding fuel was down slightly. Certainly seeing the big increase in fuel cost right now, but that will normalize a little bit more as we get into the back half of the year. Ari Rosa : Got it. That's really helpful color. Thanks for that, Adam. And then just for my second question I wanted to hit on, and maybe I missed this, but just in terms of, I know you usually disclose cargo claims ratios and on-time performance. I don't think I heard that earlier on the call and kind of in a related vein, I wanted to hear if having this kind of elevated purchase transportation expense or kind of on-boarding new employees, maybe how that's impacting service. I know there's usually kind of a little bit of a transition period there. Just your thoughts around it having kind of less direct oversight over freight as a result of kind of outsourcing more line haul, if that's kind of in some way impacting your service metrics or how you guys think about kind of managing service to the level that you've expected given that you're outsourcing more of that freight to third parties? Adam Satterfield : Yes. Certainly when you lose a little bit of control, there is that risk that it can have a negative impact on service. And as we talked about in prepared remarks that our expectation, whether it's our employees or that have a third-party partner that we're utilizing to move the freight, the expectation is the same that we want to give superior service to our customers. And that's what we're always striving for. Certainly believed that we continue to show the best-in-class service metrics, our cargo claims ratio continue at 0.1% during the quarter. And that's really the \u2013 what we strive to do, it's the value proposition we offer our customers, and it's something that we've got to pay very close attention to, but when you have the control if you will over managing the employees and the freight and having the equipment, it's certainly a lot easier to continue to have each of our employees bought into the overall success of the company. They understand over the years as we've improved our service metrics what that's done in terms of the profitable growth that we produced in our totally bought in and to delivering the very best service to our customer. So we want to continue to keep on that promise if you will. And I think every employee is continuing to be motivated by delivering the very best service to our customers. Ari Rosa : Great. Sounds good. Thanks for the time, Adam. Operator : The next question comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Todd Fowler : Hey, great. Thanks and good morning. We're pretty long into an LTL call and I don't think that there's been a question on kind of core pricing or core yield. So Greg, I'll see if you'll entertain this one. Yields during the quarter X fuel were up 10% and obviously there's some impact there from mix in the lower weight per shipment. But do you have any comments just directionally on what you're seeing in kind of the contract renewal environment? I know you're not giving a specific number there, but is this an environment where contract renewals are still accelerating and as you think about kind of the potential for some tightness in the back half of the year. Is this a market that can sustain another GRI here this year? Is that something that's more of a 2022 type phenomenon at this point? Greg Gantt : Yes. Todd, if you're talking about a GRI, we have no intentions of anything in the second half of the year. That'll be a 2022 event for sure, but the environment has been favorable probably more favorable than I can ever recall, which is a good thing. But as we've always been in the past, I'll say this time, the renewals are probably a little better than, than we've experienced before. Okay, we are having some more success, but as we've always done, we've addressed accounts on an [indiscernible] basis. If we have needs to improve those accounts, we've addressed those needs and tried to make improvements supporting. So I don't \u2013 I don't think our strategy or our approach will change at all. And that's what we'll continue to do, try to be consistent and try to be fair with our customers. Todd Fowler : Yes. Got it. That makes sense. And I would think similar to some of the earlier comments that there is some tailwinds from what others are doing in the industry. So, just as a follow-up on the weight per shipment here in the quarter is down about 4% year-over-year, it was down sequentially. And it sounds like that mainly that reflects some actions taken with some spot TL shipments, but is that roughly where the weight per shipment should settle out at this point? Or do you see that moving more either based on economic factors or specific mix issues within the network? Thanks. Greg Gantt : Yes. I would think so. It seems to have somewhat stabilized in the last couple of months. So I would expect those \u2013 that trend to continue unless something changes with what we're doing with spot quotes, and I don't anticipate that not any time soon. And Adam may have something to add to that, but that's kind of where we are today. Adam Satterfield : Now, I think we'll continue to see kind of in that 1,550 to 1,600 pound range near where we've somewhat settled now, but it could move up and down a little bit from here, but I think at this point we're kind of settled in for likely the balance of the year. Todd Fowler : Great. Understood. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. I'll try and be quick. Adam, can you just talk directionally about some of the components of that 35% revenue growth in July? Adam Satterfield : Well, I don't want to give too much just because it certainly can move around, but yes, I would just say that, that certainly the yield performance is remaining consistent. Some of the year-over-year change if you will in weight per shipment where we're trending down about that same 4%. So seen a similar type of change in the yield and obviously that implies and that was around 14% as you know, so that kind of implies what the tonnage number would be. We'll see where it falls in, but plus or minus it's just going to be somewhere around 19% threshold. Scott Group : Okay, great. And then in terms of the uses of cash, would you guys ever think about buying another LTL and then, or maybe with the buyback, if you wanted to do it in a full year like you've typically done in the past, would you think about using any debt on the balance sheet for the buyback? Thank you. Greg Gantt : Scott, I'll let Adam answer that financial question last, but at this point we certainly aren't looking to acquire another LTL. I'm not sure that makes sense and at the same time, if you go back through the history of acquisitions, certainly major ones. We haven't seen a whole lot of success, but I don't think we want to wait into that at this point. But yes, we certainly did our share back in the day, but most of those are smaller tuck-ins and geographies where we had needs and those kinds of things. So just our needs are different today than what they used to be. And at this point we have no real strong appetite for that. Adam Satterfield : And on the buyback, we had no intention at this point of using debt to finance additional buybacks. We want to continue to use the cash that we have on hand. And we continue to expect a significant cash flow from operations as we continue to see improvement there. And despite the increases that we've had in CapEx and certainly could have a big CapEx number next year as well. We haven't really fine tune that, that will come later in the year, but based on demand trends that we see, I would expect that we'll have another pretty healthy year of CapEx. We just have a tremendous amount of free cash flow and we're trying to return that to our shareholders. And we've got a pretty nominal dividend and this will continue to use the flexibility of the buyback program as we have in the past to return that excess capital back and maybe work down some of the cash balance that's on the balance sheet as well. Scott Group : All make sense. Thank you guys. Appreciate it. Adam Satterfield : Thanks, Scott. Operator : The next question comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Bruce Chan : Hey Greg. Hey Adam. Thanks for the time here. I'm just wondering if you can remind me what's your cross-border presence look like. I know we talk a lot about e-commerce when we think about some of these secular growth opportunities, but just wondering if there's anything on the near shoring side that that's meaningful and whether you've seen any more demand for that cross border capability either north or south. Adam Satterfield : Now that's, it's we've got the services certainly to Canada, primarily. We've got services to Mexico and really consider Puerto Rico, Alaska, Hawaii and so forth in our OD global division as well. But the Canada is the biggest opportunity we continue to see growth there, but we don't have assets there. We've got a good partner and that partnership in regards to the business that we may have going north, and then they handle it, or their customers that may have freight coming south has created opportunities for us. And certainly would expect some growth to continue there in that regard, but it's a smaller element of business overall for us. Bruce Chan : Okay. I appreciate that. And just one last one here. Can you remind us of what your mix of 3PL business looks like right now? And do you have any meaningful plans to change that in the near future? Adam Satterfield : Yes. It's about 20% to 25% of our overall revenue. A lot of our top 50 customers, we've got a pretty healthy mix of big 3PL accounts that are in there. And we've seen growth last year, especially during the pandemic as they were helping their customers out; we were continuing to get a good amount of freight coming out of those 3PL customers. So we've got very good relationships, most are strategic in nature. We don't have as many relationships with the 3PLs that are more transactionally minded and now trying to sell cheap rates because that's just not us and doesn't necessarily fit with our profile, but I think when they're out selling value to their customers I think they can help. And in regards to independently proven our value equation and looking at our own time performance and our claims ratio in regards to inventory management and so forth, and how maybe paying for a little bit more upfront for Old Dominion service can deliver cost savings if you think about things on a total cost of transportation standpoint for their customers. So it's been a good independent source coming in to support revenue growth, and we'd expect that we continue to see some growth with them as well into the future. Bruce Chan : Okay. Great. Thanks, Adam. Appreciate the color. Adam Satterfield : Okay, Bruce. Operator : The next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hey, good morning guys. Greg Gantt : Hey, good morning, Tyler. Tyler Brown : Hey, just one quick question. I know call has been long here. I want to come back to the equipment talk that you did upfront and its role in the capacity equation. So I'm just curious, but does this shift in e-commerce and serving these big distribution centers? I would imagine that that's driving more dropping hook requests, but does that change your trailing equipment means fundamentally, could that be an area of investment or is that really not a needle mover? Greg Gantt : Well, Tyler at this point it hasn't significantly changed our needs or requirements. Without a doubt we have experienced some delays with some accounts and getting our equipment unloaded. We certainly try to manage those advance when they happen, so we can get our equipment back. But it's definitely been a challenge, but at this point we haven't \u2013 I don't think we've changed the ratio of trailing equipment to tractors that we typically look at to determine the needs of trading equipment. So we'll continue to look at that, but I think that's a bit fair question, and if those needs change and we'll certainly address it, but at this point, nothing significant. Tyler Brown : Okay, perfect. Thanks guys. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg Gantt for any closing remarks. Greg Gantt : Well, thanks all of you for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and please feel free to call us if you have anything further. Thank you and have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you in advance for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir. Greg Gantt : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. During the third quarter, he Old Dominion team produced strong profitable growth that included new company records for quarterly revenue and profitability. The third quarter of 2021 was our third straight quarter with double digit revenue growth and the fifth straight quarter of double digit growth in earnings per diluted share. While our revenue results reflect the unprecedented demand for our best-in-class service, our ability to grow at these impressive rates is the result of our long term commitment to consistently invest in capacity. We continue to have available network capacity as well as best-in-class service, both of which are qualities that differentiate us within our industry and provide a distinct competitive advantage for Old Dominion. These qualities have also supported our ability to win market share and produce profitable growth over the long term. With continuing strength in the macroeconomic environment and limited industry capacity, we believe demand for transportation services will continue through the fourth quarter of this year and into 2022. As a result, we expect our business level momentum that began in the third quarter of 2020 will also continue. To take advantage of these opportunities and produce further profitable growth we believe that it will be important for us to continue to execute on the long term strategic plan that we have operated under for many years. This strategy focused on delivering a value proposition of superior service at a fair price to our customers, which generally creates the capital for us to further invest into capacity and technology to support our customer supply chain needs. Our most important investment, however, will continue to be in the OD family of employees. Our people are critical to our success as they work tirelessly each day to provide service value to our customers. We added over 1,000 new full-time employees between June and September of this year. These additions resulted in a 20.9% increase in our average full-time headcount as compared to the third quarter of 2020. While we have grown the OD family this year, the capacity of our people continues to be our biggest need to support future growth. As a result, we expect that we will continue to add new full-time employees to our team during the fourth quarter and next year. We believe further additions will be necessary to prepare for anticipated growth and to also reduce the use of third-party purchase transportation. We expect to use third-party purchase transportation during the fourth quarter at levels similar to the third quarter. While we would like to reduce this level of utilization, we must continue to supplement the capacity of our people and our fleet in support of our topline revenue performance. We hold the third parties that we work with to the same standards of excellence and our team remains fully committed to providing best-in-class service to our customers. Our customers' expectations for excellence do not change, regardless of how we move their freight and given the supply chain challenges that many of them are currently facing, we want them to have complete confidence in our ability to deliver. Old Dominion set the standard in our industry with our ability to provide superior service and service center capacity to support our customers' growth. As a result, we believe we are in a better position than any other carrier to win additional market share and further increase shareholder value over the long term. Thank you for joining us this morning and now Adam will discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you Greg and good morning. Old Dominion's (revenue grew 32.3% in the third quarter to $1.4 billion and our operating ratio improved to 72.6%. The combination of these changes led to a 44.4% increase in earnings per diluted share to $2.47 for the quarter. Our revenue growth was balanced between LTL volumes and yield, both of which were supported by the strong domestic economy and capacity issues within the industry. Our LTL funds increased 13.7% and LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 15.7%, which also reflects the impact on our fuel surcharge program from the increase in diesel fuel prices. Excluding fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 10.1% as a result of the continued success with our yield improvement initiatives as well as changes in the mix of our freight. On a sequential basis, third quarter LTL shipments per day increased 3.2% over the second quarter 2021 as compared to a 10-year average sequential increase of 2.9%. LTL tons per day increased 1.0% as compared to the 10-year average sequential increase of 1.9%. These 10- average trends exclude our 2020 metrics for a more normalized comparison. At this point in October, with only a few work days remaining in the month our revenue per day has increase by approximately 33% to 35% when compared to October 2020. We will provide the actual revenue related details for October in our third quarter Form 10-Q. The operating ratio for the third quarter improved 190 basis points to 72.6% as a result of the operating leverage created by our revenue growth as well as our continued focus on operation efficiency. Many of our cost categories improved as a percent of revenue during the quarter, although our operating supplies and expenses increased 200 basis points, due primarily to the rising cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products. As a percent of revenue, salaries, wages and benefits improved 320 basis points between the periods compared. Our productive labor cost within this expense category improved 200 basis points which more than offset the 130 basis point increase in purchase transportation. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $364.3 million and $872.6 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively, while capital expenditures were $178.69 and $384.7 million for the same periods. We noted in our release this morning that our capital expenditures are now estimated to be $565 million for this year. The $40 million decrease from our prior estimate is mainly due to the timing on large real estate projects that will be pushed into next year. We will provide further details about 2022 capital expenditure plan with our fourth quarter earnings release, but at this time we expect to increase our expenditures to support our ongoing market share initiatives and to reduce the average age of our fleet. We continued to return capital to shareholders during the third quarter through our dividend and share repurchase programs, including the $250 million accelerated share repurchase agreement that will expire no later than March 2022. For the first nine months of this year, the cash utilized for shareholder return programs included $599 million for share repurchases and $69.4 million of cash dividends. Effective tax rate for the third quarter 2021 was 25.2% as compared 24.8% in the third quarter 2020. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25.8% for the fourth quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we will be happy to open for the floor for questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Chris Wetherbee : Hi. Thanks good morning guys. Maybe to start off, the tonnage trends, Adam, you mention, the tonnage trends of the quarter. I mean you are a little bit below sequentially what is normal. And clearly, we saw a little bit of a deceleration in August before it seems like September picked back up. So could you talk a little bit about sort of business conditions in the quarter and maybe what we saw intra-quarter and how that's played out as moves here into early October. Adam Satterfield : Sure. One of the things driving the change in shipments versus tonnage for as well to point out is the fact that we continue to have a little bit lower wait for shipment rather. And that's the change that we talked about in recent quarters as we continue to focus on more traditional LTL shipments and try to work out some of these larger, harder to handle type of shipments that are more transactional in nature generally within our system. So that had a little bit of an impact overall and that discrepancy, if you will, between the tons and the shipments. When we look at shipments, they were on a sequential basis just above what the 10-year trend would have been at 3.2% versus the 2.92%, a little discrepancy there. But back to the point of your question, when we look at really the volumes in general but tonnage and shipments as we work through the quarter, we were right in line with normal sequential trends in July versus June but then had a pretty big step back in August. Our tons per day in August, decreased 1.6% from July. The 10-year average changes is 0.5% increase there. And a big reason for that was the fact that we started seeing across the country the rise in COVID cases and just the ongoing labor issues that are affecting many customers and warehouses throughout the country. That certainly had an effect on business directly and indirectly, really. So that was an issue that caused us, in some cases, to not be able to pickup freight when we couldn't be able to deliver it And so there was certainly a ripple effect, I think, throughout the economy and reflected in our business results as well. But as cases started to improve, some of that pickup back in the labor participation rates, we saw significant recovery. Really, it began towards the end of August but really accelerated through the month of September, such that our tons per day in September were up 5.2% over August versus the 10-year average change of 3.7%. So it certainly made up for that and so as we accelerated through the end of the quarter. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That's very helpful day. And it seems like revenue per day in October would suggest that maybe that trend has continued. So kind of curious about that. But as a follow-up, I kind of wanted to get a sense of, with the context of tonnage and obviously with very strong pricing environment, but obviously you are hiring at a rapid clip. I would imagine, there's some inflation on that side. How do we think about the normal sequential cadence of operating ratios as we look through the fourth quarter? Adam Satterfield : Sure. Well, Greg mentioned in our prepared remarks, we will continue to focus on bringing on new employees as we go through the fourth quarter. And it's something that frankly we have been doing all year. If you look at the change in our volumes and change in people, we have exceeded what our normal sequential trends have been, I think, for five straight quarters. So that's something that we think will continue given the strength of the demand environment that we certainly feel very confident that that will extend into the 2022. So it's important for us to continue to really build up all the elements of capacity that we need in our business and that people, fleet and the service center side to be able to accommodate our customers' expectations for growth and to be able to continue to deliver best-in-class service to them. With that said, I still feel good about the performance in the third quarter. We were pretty much right in line to sequential operating ratio performance, it was right in line with normal trends. And that factored in a lot of calls that are coming onboard. We still face some of those cost challenges. But we would expect to be right in line with what our normal sequential change is from 3Q to 4Q. And that's typically in the 200 to 250 basis point increase from the third quarter. I think that we should be able to be in that range while we will have some calls continuing to come at as, both in relation to the investment in new employees. We are still taking delivery on some equipment. So we have got some cost pressures there. But we have still got incredible topline revenue performance that's helping to offset those and certainly yield performance has continued to be strong. But as you alluded to, with the change in our volumes and overall revenue for October, we are performing well above what the normal sequential trends would otherwise be on the volume inside and pricing strength is certainly continuing as well. Chris Wetherbee : Great. That's very helpful. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jordan Alliger : Hi. Yes. Just a follow-up, I guess, on some of the headcount related things. When you think about volume growth, whatever the expectations are in the headcount need, should it roughly track once we get past this year, headcount and volumes? Or do you need less headcount relative to volume growth? Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Yes. Jordan, I think it will continue to tract, to some extent. But you have got to remember, ewe have really chasing it for the most part all year. As our growth has accelerated, we continue to chase our needs and continue to play catch-up to some degree. But I do think that we will start to moderate and level back out to more normal type pace going forward. At least that's what we hope. Jordan Alliger : Okay. And then I assume, as others, you are seeing in order to get the people and you have had good success, obviously and the need to push up the wage per employee or cost per employee, however you want to look at it. Adam Satterfield : Yes. We have done the same thing this year that we have done in years past. We gave our annual rate in September and in some cases we have had to increase starting wages. We have had some places where we have had referral bonuses and those kind of things. So we have had lock-up matching in quarters past. We are having success. We just have to work a little harder at it and do things a little bit differently, whatever it takes to get the folks onboard. But you were having success and I expect we will continue to do so. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Morning, all. So maybe the first question is along that similar trend. You guys are well known to keep your 25% excess capacity. How does that trend over the next several quarters, do you think? Is now the right time to build that buffer, given the higher cost of building capacity in the current environment? And also what are your competitors doing? Are they batten the hatches and trying to get price? Or everybody in the industry also trying to build capacity? Adam Satterfield : Ravi, we are still at about 15% to 20% excess capacity and that's in the service center network which is the most important in the LTL businessman. I mean it certainly takes people in trucks but that's the longest term form of capacity and the hardest to put in place. And we have been consistent with our investments over the years and we will continue on that front as we finish out this year and then transitions into next year. But that's about at the same point that we were when we finished last quarter as well. So despite the strong sequential volume performance that we had in 3Q, we have been able to keep that excess capacity level at about the same spot. So we are going to keep after it and keep adding to those capacity levels. And certainly, as Greg mentioned, we have got to really continue to be focused in the short term on continuing to add people into the mix. And that's probably been in our biggest need all year as we work through the balance of the year. But it really takes all three forms. And we came into this year, we don't really know exactly what our competitors' strategies are but we came into this year believing that we had more capacity than anyone. And that really goes back to our 10-year investment that we have made. We have expanded our door count by over 50% over the last 10 years. We have seen very little investment from some of the others, maybe a service center here and there but nothing at any major scale. And so that has created an environment for us to be able to win more market share than anyone else. And certainly, we believe we still got best-in-class service. So we have got a service advantage in the marketplace and we have got more capacity than anyone else. And that gives us the capacity advantage in the marketplace and that usually produces pretty phenomenal results when we get into the strong demand periods like we have been in this year and what we expect to see for next year as well. So it gives us a lot of confidence to say, we are the best positioned carrier to continue to produce profitable growth and increase shareholder value, even from the levels from which we are currently operating. Ravi Shanker : Got it. That's great detail. Maybe just follow-up on the capacity thing. Just on new trucks, do you feel like you are going to get all the trucks that you need in 2022? Or does that look like something that happens in 2023 or maybe in 2024? Adam Satterfield : We think we are going to get what we have asked for. At this point in time, there is no indication that we will not. So we will have to wait and see, obviously, but so far the outlook for a truck standpoint is good. Ravi Shanker : Very good. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Greg, in the last call you mentioned hopes for maybe nine new terminals by the end of this year, although acknowledging that some will definitely pushed into 2022. Can you give us an update on the pace for the remainder of this year? What you have line of sight on for early 2022? And if we can even take a step further and think about, holistically, the next 12 months, what's your kind of ideal on additional capacity as it relates to either terminal count or door count? Greg Gantt : Yes. The terminal count, Jon, I think we have got another three or four that we expect to open in this calendar year. And we have numerous others that we are working on for next year. I can't give you an exact number but I am going to say, we are in about the eight to 10 range for next year, something like that. So we have got a lot of projects that we were in the middle and then we have got an awful lot on the list to start as we go forward. But just remember, lot of those things, they take time, what's like pulling teeth, if you will, in some cases. But we are working on locations where we need help and where we think we know we could be capacity constrained. So with all that and hope to continue to be able to accomplish whatever, wherever our needs are. Jon Chappell : Okay. And my follow-up will be along the same lines. I think when some people here, capacity expansion or terminal expansion, their immediate thought goes to start-up costs and potentially weighing on the aggregate margin. Given the size of your network today, is there just better scale of onboarding a new terminal so that the immediate tonnage impact from that has a pretty de minimis impact on the aggregate operating ratio of the entire firm? Adam Satterfield : Yes. We certainly start out, I mean we are covering all markets today. So when we open a new facility, it already starts with a good book of business, if you will and is pretty much profitable immediately. And so that also frees up some capacity in the existing service center that we move ZIP Codes and freight out of into the new location. So that's been part of our expansion process over the years and certainly we have invested a lot of dollars in expanding our network and that 50% increase in door count that I talked about earlier. But that kind of all goes into it and it's why when we talk about our yield management philosophy that we focus on getting an increase every year in our revenue per shipment to exceed what our cost per shipment inflation will be, but also to support the continued investment in our service center network. And as supply chains become more sophisticated, customers are leveraging our network to their benefits as we are processing freight through our network of about 250 service center today. So it's something that we are effectively purchasing real estate capacity on behalf of our customers and we want to be only that's really making the type of material investments that we have. So it's important for us to continue to keep that within the context of yield management so that we can afford these service centers that are becoming more and more expensive as we are competing with different parties to go out and find the real estate to continue to support our growth. But certainly, we have had great success in the past. We got a good team detail that's always trying to stay ahead of the growth curve and at the levels where we are, we feel like we have got us probably stay a little bit further ahead of the curve than we have had in years past. But we have got a good plan. We got a list of about 35 to 40 service centers that we think we want to add to the network in due time and probably won't stop there.. We feel like we have got a very long runway for growth ahead of us, given what our expectations for growth in the industry, given the consolidation in the industry and general lack of investment by the carriers it's certainly a great spot for us to be in to continue to be in a good position to win market share. Jon Chappell : Yes. Absolutely. Thanks so much Adam. Very helpful. Thanks Greg. Adam Satterfield : Yes, sir. Operator : The next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Good morning. So I wanted to ask you first maybe just on kind of broader supply chain constraints and how you think they affect you? Or perhaps they just don't? But obviously, there is a lot of discussion around the ports. And it's pretty clear there, truck load is constrained, wage is constrained intermodal as well. Is there any effect to your business to get some spillover freight? But just how do you think that some of the broader labor constraints and supply chain noise affect you? Is there some tonnage that's constrained or maybe some cost pressure? Or are you very pretty much immune to it? Adam Satterfield : I don't know if we are immune to anything that's going on in the marketplace. But, Tom, we do see continued strength off the West Coast. I mean obviously there is a lot of stuff sitting out there in the water and as it continues to get into the warehouses and whatnot, we are seeing and feeling that strength in those markets. But certainly, was not immune to anything. And any change or any change of strategy or whatever by our suppliers or our customers will change some of the things that we have to do and possibly where the freight comes to, goes from, whatever. But right now, we adjust as is necessary. And so far, I would say, the impact has been somewhat minimal, if you will. Again, not immune to anything that's going on, but not a huge impact. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Okay. I appreciate it. Another pretty high level question. And then what about tonnage growth? I guess you talked about revenue per day in October. I don't know if you want to comment a bit more about tonnage. But how do you think about the ballpark for tonnage growth might be in fourth quarter? And what it potentially could be in 2022? Do you kind of go back to like mid single digit or high single digits next year? Or how do you broadly think about the framework for tonnage growth in 4Q? And I know it would be high-level for next year. Adam Satterfield : We don't want to give any specific guidance per se. But the balance of the revenue growth in October is pretty consistent, pretty split evenly between yield and tonnage like it was in the third quarter. Those two numbers were pretty close. On the yield side, obviously recently fuel prices have continued to increase, so that overall revenue per hundredweight metric will continue to reflect that number. But again, we are still seeing considerable strength on the volume side as well. Certainly, as we go through the period we think about the comparisons, the comparisons certainly get a little tougher each month as we work through the fourth quarter. It was last year, our volumes were accelerating month after month, such that the third quarter was a bit of really strong outperformance versus what our normal trends have been. Typically, we see strong performance for five or six quarters like that and then kind of revert to normal sequential trends which, by the way, reflect a whole lot of market share gain over the past 10 years. When you think about our shipments per day, they are averaging about 50% increase versus where we were 10 years ago. So there is a lot of market share gains that are in those numbers. But overall, I think if you just were to say that we operate on d normal sequential trends, that us with some pretty strong numbers on the volume side next year. And we don't want to say that's what the forecast is. But right now, we haven't seen any letdown with respect to demand. So it's hard to call that we are going to see any slowdown. And certainly based on customer conversations and everything that we see and read, we feel like this unprecedented level of demand that we have seen this year will continue into next year, especially if other carriers are continuing to be capacity constrained. That certainly could continue to just push more and more volumes our way. And so, we just got to be in a c position to continue to bring it onboard and make sure we are focused on profitable growth, which is what our long term focus has been and continue to take care of our customers in offering them solutions in various ways, be it handling all their LTL shipments, using out truckload brokerage division to help them out with any truckload moves as that's put and then the grades division that we have in our non-LTL as well which is mainly focused in the Southeast is seeing a lot of strength there. So it all comes back to building a relationship with your customer and trying to continue to serve them as best you can. And we are going to continue with that focus as we transition into 2022, but not keeping our eye off the ball with respect to the fourth quarter as well. We still got a lot of work to do to finish out this year with strength. Tom Wadewitz : It sounds like your resource additions, your headcount, you are set, it seems line, you are planning for pretty good growth next year as well, just what you are doing on headcount. Is that fair? Adam Satterfield : Fair. Yes, sir. We still got to try to reduce this purchase transportation. We like to get back to managing the business completely in source from a line haul standpoint. And that's what we have done in the past and we are using it to supplement the team right now, again just getting back to being able to serve our customers. But certainly that's the focus. And it will take our headcount exceeding our shipment count. Over the long term, those two numbers are really aligned, the change in headcount, the change in shipments. But we have got to catch back up with things and we have been under the shipment growth, if you will, for the past year and year-and-a-half. And so it's going to take a period to sort of regain that to not only catch up with our business overall but really to be anticipating the growth that we are likely see next year. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hi. Thanks. Good morning guys. Adam Satterfield : Good morning Scott. Scott Group : So you guys will clearly be sub-75% on operating ratio for the calendar year? I can't imagine you want to put a timeline on it. But do you feel like you have got line of sight to getting to about 70% or sub-70% OR over for the next several years? Adam Satterfield : I think that's something that we just got to continue to work at. When you look over the past two years, the improvement that we have had in the operating ratio, the two-year performance really has only been exceeded by the two-year performance back in 2010, 2011, coming out of the depths of the recession. So we are really proud of what we have achieved over the last few years and we feel confident to say that we know we have got room for further improvement. I think we will wait until we get to the fourth quarter to really start talking about kind of what our next target will be. But again, if you look over the long term, we have averaged 100 to 150 basis point improvement in the operating ratio each year and that's sort of gets back to that delta between our revenue and cost per shipment. So a lot go into each of those two numbers, us managing our cost and continuing to focus on productivity and offsetting all the cost that go along with expanding our model. And that creates some short term cost headwinds but when you look at the long term performance for what we have done over the past 10 years, producing an average of 10% to 11% change in revenue each year and about 25% average annual increase in our EPs, that's driven considerable share value over that 10 year period and we want to continue to do that as we look out into the next 10 year horizon as well. So certainly a lot of opportunity, but of a lot of hard work and focus on execution on our part to make it happen. Scott Group : Okay. And then I want to ask on the labor side. I know we have touched on headcount. I guess, two things. Do you feel the need for wages or comp per employee to increase more than normal given inflation? And then just any thoughts on vaccine mandate and what your expectations are there? How you are planning for it? Do you think it's going to happen, carve-outs, things like that? Greg Gantt : Yes. Scott, as I mentioned before, we have had to do some things a little bit different from a pay and benefit standpoint, pay mainly. We look at benefits every year and see where we can make improvements. And we have done that over the course of time. But I don't think we have got to do anything drastically different from a pay standpoint. We did give an annual increase again this past September as we have done in years past. And again, we have had to do referral bonuses and hiring bonuses in those certain locations where we are really challenged to find folks. But I don't think it will be significantly different going forward what we have to do. Like I said before and I have said over the years, we can still get people. We just have to work harder at doing it. And I think we will continue with that focus. We are always looking for ways and different avenues to accomplish whatever the hiring needs that we have are. So we will continue to do that. What was that last question you asked about vaccines? Scott Group : Yes. I was just asking your thoughts on vaccine mandate and what you are doing to plan for it. Greg Gantt : Well, yes, we would love to have some clear line of sight as to just exactly what's coming down the line. I know you have heard the same thing we have heard and there's a mandate supposedly coming. But I am not exactly sure where that is right now. I think you also know that we actually, back about four months ago, we offered our employees an incentive to get vaccinated. And we have had some success with that. As far as the mandate goes, that would be extremely difficult, in my opinion. It's either get vaccinated or do the testing. We are still working on that and trying to figure out how we can accomplish testing the numbers of folks that we would have to test on a weekly basis. Extremely, extremely difficult to accomplish, I don't want to say impossible. But there are some challenges there that I think are going to be very difficult if it comes to that. And God help our industry, if it does. If you think we have got supply chain issues now across the country, that could really throw it into some kind of a crazy tailspin. But we will see where it goes. But hopefully, clear heads will prevail at some point. Scott Group : Are you hearing that? Do you have confidence in that? 1 mean everyone says the same thing, it would be a disaster. Are you confident that the government gets that? Greg Gantt : Confident that the government gets that? No, not at all. I sure hope at some point in time, I think common sense has to prevail. I know there are some forces in Washington. I think the ATA is working on a couple of different things. And hopefully, we will have some success with that, exempting truckers, whatever the strategy might be. But at some point in time, I think common sense has to prevail. There's a place for that. I am not sure we have used a whole lot of it to this point. But certainly, there is a place for that as it relates to vaccines and mandates and whatnot. I think the other thing is, fortunately, the numbers we are seeing are moving in the right direction. As far as COVID goes, they are really dropping. I saw something on the news this morning where we are down to a 4%-something positivity rate. Maybe that was just for the state of North Carolina, I am not sure. But the numbers do look a lot better than they did back several months ago. So again, I think if you take that into account with where we are as far as the numbers of cases and those kind of things, surely, at some point, common sense will prevail. Scott Group : Thank you guys. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks very much. I wanted to follow-up on the long term margin question. Adam, for a while, you have kind of pegged incrementals at 25%. Obviously, it's been much better than that, just given how much shipment growth has outpaced expense growth. But obviously, that's reversing a little bit and incrementals seem to kind of be coming down settling maybe in the low 30% level. And those types of incrementals obviously imply kind of about 70% OR. That's really sort of the plateau for the company versus kind of the very low-70s you are doing now. Is there anything, Adam, in that kind of framework that you would disagree with? Do you think structural incrementals have moved up relative to where you saw them a few years ago? Just talk about kind of how you see that framework evolving. Adam Satterfield : Sure. One, we have said this before, but we don't manage the company to the incremental margin. That's just the calculation of all the work that we do in sort of building out the balancing the revenue growth and margin improvement opportunities. We had used that long term target of 25% really as an inverse to say we were working towards a 75% operating ratio goal. And that's really more of what we talk about within the company for where we think we can take the operating ratio. So I think we will give a little bit more color on that when we get to our fourth quarter call. Obviously, based on kind of what I mentioned earlier about the target for the fourth quarter, that puts us at an annual operating ratio somewhere around 74%. So it certainly looks like we will be able to beat that 75% OR target this year. And as it comes down to incremental margins, I think this will go down as our biggest incremental margin year in our history. And when we have talked about the cost structure with you before, we have laid out kind of the cost structure as balanced between our variable and fixed costs and how we can operate at a 35% to 40% incremental margin in a particular quarter in a short period of time. But we don't want to get overly fixated on incremental margins because, again, we are focusing on the investments that are required to drive long term growth. We don't measure the success of our business based on how strong an incremental can be. It's really some of those longer term numbers that I referenced earlier. And we want to be able to repeat that because we think there's a lot of growth opportunity left within our business. And so that's going to be the focus. But it requires investment and that can create some short term headwinds. And if that's the only lens that you look at things through, you miss out on a ton of opportunity to drive shareholder value. And so we are going to keep that long term focus, continue to make al the necessary investments. And if that drives the incremental down a little bit, one, I am pretty pleased with 33%. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at for the quarter and producing a very strong 72.6% operating ratio. But based on that cost structure breakdown, we feel confident in saying that we certainly can drive the operating ratio meaningfully lower. And whenever we get to whatever that next threshold might be, we will continue to look at managing the business and how the algorithm works. And it's not to say that whatever the next stopping point will be the final stopping point. We think that there's a lot of opportunity left here. So we will keep marching forward. The algorithm certainly has worked for us in the past and we think can continue to work for us into the future. Amit Mehrotra : Sure. Yes, that makes sense. Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up. You were helpful in providing tonnage for October or at least kind of at a high level. But obviously, when you deconstruct tonnage, weight has been a decent drag to tonnage. When do you think that cycles through because obviously that\u2019s implications for headcount relative to shipment growth? But when do you think like the cycling through of the weight per shipment drag happens and it's a little bit more of a neutral to the tonnage number? Adam Satterfield : Yes. If you go back to the first quarter of this year, we were still at sort of a 1,600-pound range average. That dropped to 1,570 in the second quarter. And so I feel like we are probably likely to settle in this 1,550-pound range, kind of plus or minus 20 pounds or so. And so we will still have a little bit of a drag, if you want to call it that, with the first quarter comparison. But by 2Q, you should start to see that of next year more normalize and see the shipment and tonnage performance more comparable with one another. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead. Jack Atkins : Ho Greg, good morning and thank you for taking my question. Greg Gantt : Hi Jack. Jack Atkins : I guess just to kind of think about pricing and yield momentum here for a moment, just based on the commentary that you guys have around the momentum in the business from a demand perspective and the expectation for that to continue into 2022. Can you maybe speak to the pricing momentum that you are seeing maybe in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year? And as you sort of look out into 2022, with truckload carriers talking about potentially double digit contractual rate increases. How should we be thinking about maybe the core price increases in the LTL market more broadly? Not speaking to OD specifically, but just kind of thinking about the potential for further yield acceleration in 2022. Adam Satterfield : Well, I think for the industry, if we continue to see this supply and demand imbalance, in the past, many of the carriers that are out of capacity certainly use the environment to push prices meaningfully higher and try to take advantage and improve the margin. So certainly, that type of environment is supportive of our pricing initiatives. For us, it's more of a long term consistent approach and one that we think is fair but equitable. It's one that we can sit down with our customers and talk about what our cost inflation is and what our needs are in terms of reinvesting in the business to either improve customer service or investing in ways that ultimately are going to reduce cost. So it's a win-win situation for both us and our customers. And so we try to target our cost inflation and then some and we have been pretty successful with that. And so that will continue to be the focus.  But with that said, we are always focusing on the individual account profitability. And so when you are in these types of environments, there are some accounts that their operating ratios are not as good as others. And those are the types of accounts that really over the last couple of years that we have had to address some issues and there's different ways to improve yield. It's not always through price. And so that's where you sit down and you build on your relationship together and work through different initiatives that ultimately can create the same results of yield improvement there. So certainly, given the expectation that the demand trends will remain very strong and given the lack of capacity that we believe is in the industry and that's mainly grounded in the feedback that we are getting from customers, we certainly expect there to be a strong pricing environment for the industry next year, for which we will be able to benefit. Jack Atkins : Okay. That's great. And I guess just maybe following up. Greg, kind of going back to a comment that you had in the press release around length of haul extending out on a year-over-year basis. Could you maybe talk a little bit about what's driving that? Is that a function of comps? Is that a function of maybe some changes to your own business mix? Just would be curious if you could maybe expand a little bit on that comment? And if that's maybe more of a structural change for you? Greg Gantt : Jack, as I mentioned before, I think we are seeing an awful lot of strength right now off of the West Coast. And obviously, all those containers sitting out there, that freight has got to move in, at some point. And I think that's why we are seeing the small increase in our length of haul. I don't know that there's anything else that would contribute to that. Jack Atkins : Okay. All right. That makes sense. Thanks again for the time. Operator : The next question is from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Todd Fowler : Great. Thanks and good morning. Adam, to the comments on the OR progression in the fourth quarter, I guess it's pretty encouraging that the expectation is to be in the historical range because it seems like that maybe headcount growth would be a little bit higher than what you typically have seen and purchase transportation is going to be elevated. So what are the things that are helping you stay within the normal range despite maybe adding a few more heads than you typically would in 4Q and running a little bit more PT? Adam Satterfield : Well, I think that, one, the topline performance certainly helps offset a lot of cost. And we will see how the rest of the quarter shapes up, if you will. But typically, we see a little bit of softness, if you will, just about 0.5% to 1% drop in our revenue per day performance from 3Q to 4Q. And so based on the current performance, we are definitely outperforming October, if you will. So we will see where that puts us for the end of the quarter. But we are doing a lot of things with respect to managing costs. We talk a lot about the labor cost and that's probably 65% of total cost in our salary, wages and benefits line. And we have seen a lot of productivity this year, especially within our line haul and our pickup delivery operations. We have lost some productivity on the dock. So I think that the fourth quarter and the first quarter, that will be some opportunity that we continue to focus on. It's not that we haven't been focused on it. But I think that that's something that will help on the labor front if we can reduce the levels of purchase transportation and manage more freight with our people and our equipment. Certainly think that that will be beneficial as well, given the rates that we are having to pay. And we are using about the same level in October as we were in the third quarter. We hope that we will be able to reduce that level of utilization a little bit. But at this point, the topline trends have dictated all year. I think every quarterly call, we have had for the last four quarters, we have talked about wanting to be able to reduce that expense category. But the topline trends have really dictated that continued utilization. So we will see where that balances out. But there's just a lot of cost management that is here within the business and that we are focused on as well as continuing to see that strong topline performance that will help offset some of this inflation as we are bringing on new people. We will continue to see our benefit costs in the third quarter were higher and expect that that will likely continue as we are continuing to balance out the number of hours worked by our employees. As we increase that workforce, there's certainly going to be more incremental benefit costs that will be incurred. But we feel good about all the other contributing factors to help offset some of that cost inflation. Todd Fowler : Okay. Yes. That helps and all that makes sense. Just for my follow-up, I know that the timing of equipment deliveries can have an impact on particularly the depreciation side. This year, it looks like depreciation is going to run pretty much flat with last year. Do you look at 2022 as kind of being a catch-up where you see more depreciation come in based on timing of equipment deliveries? And I would expect there will be a little bit of put and take with PT probably coming down. But just any thoughts about how depreciation trends into 2022, just given the cost kind of tail that that can have? Adam Satterfield : Yes. Certainly, we have seen the equipment deliveries delayed a little bit this year. We haven't finished completely with the delivery cycle at this point. But we do expect that all units ordered will be delivered to us and we have already had preliminary conversations with our OEMs about next year as well. And as Greg mentioned, we believe we will get all of the equipment that we need to be able to manage the growth that we are anticipating. But that has resulted in some depreciation that's kind of come in, in different periods. that too will be something that we are only about 80% through September complete with the CapEx order on the equipment. There will be some deliveries that we are taking here in the fourth quarter that will add to that depreciation base and then that will trend up as we go into 2022. But typically, you look at kind of the long term trends, there's a pretty consistent factor of what our CapEx is and a percent of that that kind of adds to the depreciation base. And I don't want to get into too many details until we are really ready to roll out what the full CapEx plan will be. But there will be some carryover into next year from this year's CapEx plan. And then certainly next year, we are expecting that we will be spending quite a bit more than this year on total CapEx. Todd Fowler : Okay. Got it. Thanks for the time this morning. Operator : The next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good morning. So Greg and Adam, happy to join your call. Just some cleanup questions for me. You have covered a lot. The wage incentives, Greg, are they accelerating now? Or are they stabilizing? I just want to get an idea on the environment. Maybe just thoughts on how it's changed through the year? Greg Gantt : Yes. We did some things. Ken, if you go back into earlier in the year when we were having issues, we implemented some couple of different bonus plans and incentives, whatever it took to bring the folks on that we needed. But that's moderated, to some degree. We haven't really increased those tied bonuses or incentives, whatever, of late that I am aware of. So I think that's moderated to some degree. Ken Hoexter : So that's a good sign if you are able to still get people and your incentives are moderating, I guess. The sequential OR commentary. Are there adjustments you worked on to smooth that? Adam, you noted it was a typical 200 to 250 basis points third quarter, fourth quarter. Are there seasonal surcharges you look to add to maybe smooth that out a bit? Adam Satterfield : No. There's no surcharges or anything like that. But the fourth quarter, it can be a bit unusual. There are a couple of adjustments to our insurance line. We go through an annual actuarial process in the fourth quarter that can move that insurance line. And there's some other accrual-related items within our benefits program that get looked at by an actuary each year. So there can be some adjustments in the past. We are perfect with our estimates as we move through the year and those are pretty minimal and they haven't been overly material in years past. But for example, last year, when you look at the fourth quarter, the insurance and claims line was only 0.9% and it had been at a run rate of about 1.1%. So a little bit of a favorable adjustment, if you will, there. But absent those types of things, nothing else that really comes in that's different from any other period. Ken Hoexter : Okay. And then my last one is just you talked a lot about maybe expansion in terms of service centers and adding doors. Anything you want to highlight on productivity gains in terms of turnover per door or any other room for improvement on expanding capacity with the network? Or is that just doing what you are doing to get the 15%, 20% beyond that you need the additional service centers? Adam Satterfield : I don't think really anything different to add to it, just we are building up, anticipating what our growth levels are going to be and trying to ensure that we are building up the capacity within the service center network to make sure that not only can we handle the growth that may come at us next year, but still maintain this target of 20% to 25% excess capacity that we like to have in the system. In the LTL world, it's the doors that really can control the amount of freight that can be processed through the system. And so we never want our network to be a limiting factor to our growth. And those service centers are not easy to add and the additions don't come quick either. So you really have to have them out there and it's why it's so important for us to invest even in periods where you might see market softness. The investments that we made in 2016 and 2019, those were critical to be able to accommodate all the growth opportunities that we are seeing in the present. So we just want to make sure that we continue to build out that capacity and just have it there and ready as our customers continue to call on us and want to give us more and more of their freight. Ken Hoexter : No. I wasn't arguing the need for the additional service centers. I was just wondering if there's anything more you can do to improve productivity on existing centers to gain additional capacity. Adam Satterfield : Well, I mean that's just the density and yield breakdown. If we keep on average that 20% to 25%, just say every stick of freight that comes through an average service center is going to drive incremental improvement in the operating ratio to that one particular service center where we may have expanded it two years ago. And then certainly, the yield performance has got to be there to offset the generalized core cost inflation at that service center level as well. So you build that out and scale it across 250 facilities while we may be expanding maybe 15 facilities in any given year or so, you have got a large grouping that have already been expanded, incurred that incremental depreciation. And now we are driving profit improvement at each service center level. So that's really what's driven the overall model is to continue to invest ahead of growth and then that density and yield contribution drives the bottomline growth faster than the top line. Ken Hoexter : Great, Adam. I appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Bascome Majors : Yes. As you mentioned earlier, you increased your door count by 50%, while most of the industry was flat or down over the last decade. and clearly, that created a lot of value for your customers, employees and shareholders. I mean as we look over the next five to 10 years, though, it does feel like more of your competitors, though not all of them, are pursuing a growth-oriented approach to the market. I know we have had a lot of questions on capacity. But can you frame how big is big enough for OD, whether in terms of tonnage or market share or service centers, however really you want to measure it? And when do we get to the point as you look forward where that margin benefit of the growth investment starts to decline more noticeably? Thank you. Greg Gantt : I will take a shot at the first part of your question, Bascome. I am not sure that we really look at it like that, how big is big enough. I think it's all based on where we see our needs and where are they and what do we need to make sure we can service our customers as we have committed to them to do. And I think that's the key. Where does that take us? How big do we become? I don't know. That's not something that we have looked at or focused on. I don't know that that's extremely productive. So I wouldn't say that we have really looked at it that way. But wherever our needs are, we will continue to address them. And down the road, where it takes us? I guess we will just have to wait and see. Bascome Majors : Thank you for the perspective. Operator : The next question is from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Bruce Chan : Hi. Good morning everyone and thanks for squeezing me in here. Just want to come back to the labor side of things quickly and some of the headcount increases. Can you maybe give us a little color on where those new hires are coming in as far as the breakdown between drivers and dock labor? And then just as a follow-up, Adam, you touched on some of the productivity potential. But if you go through that onboarding process, how long does it typically take for you to get those new hires up to full potential? Thank you. Greg Gantt : Yes. It's the breakdown. Obviously, we have got to have both drivers and our platform employees to move the freight. So pretty consistent balance with our line haul drivers, our pickup and delivery drivers, especially as we have added new service centers, not only just the general growth that the business has had and then the platform employees as well, mainly the productive labor employees that are responsible for moving the freight and handling freight for our customers. So that's driving the majority of that growth in the headcount. And it's been something that, to say your headcount is up 21% essentially is pretty meaningful, especially given all the conversations about labor shortages around the country. So we are certainly proud of how successful we have been, despite the fact that we said we would love to continue to hire more, if you will. And it's just a balance on the productivity. The biggest learning curve happens on the dock for us. You can't get too overly caught up in one particular metric versus another. The most important for us is to make sure that each new employee on the dock understands that their number one priority is to use all the tools and techniques that we have in place to protect our customers' freight. And whether that's the dunnage, the airbags, utilizing the load bars that are in our line haul, trailers, everything that really drives that overall value proposition. The claims management is a big part of that. And we continue to have cargo claims ratio at 0.1% to 0.2%. So that's something that we are really proud of and more motivated that we make sure our employees understand that, that is a part of the value equation. That's part of the piece of our yield management success over the years and a big differentiating factor between us and many of our competitors. So there may be a six-month learning curve in place for people to come on to make sure they are effectively preventing claims and also the other piece of it is maximizing our load factor to ensure that they are utilizing the entire queue. That's our biggest cost element is line haul. And so we want to make sure that they are more focused on those key factors, if you will, versus just the number of shipments per hour that we might manage on the dock. But that gives you the opportunity as those new people are now more seasoned, certainly, that's why we are looking at seeing some of that productivity opportunity as we turn the page into 2022. And certainly, would love to see some improvement as we finish out the balance of the year. But I think that that will be a pretty good opportunity for us to drive some further cost improvement into next year. Bruce Chan : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg Gantt for any closing remarks. Greg Gantt : Well, thank you all today for your participation. We surely appreciate your questions and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks and hope you have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir. Greg Gantt : Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield our CFO. After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion finished 2021 with outstanding fourth quarter financial performance that resulted in new company records for annual revenues and profitability. The fourth quarter of 2021 was our fourth straight quarter with double-digit revenue growth, and the sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth in earnings per diluted share. We are encouraged by the momentum in our business and believe that we are uniquely positioned to win additional market share in 2022. We can do this by continuing to execute on the same strategic plan that has driven our history of long-term profitable growth. This strategy is centered on our ability to deliver a value proposition of superior service at a fair price to our customers. The OD family of employees worked through every challenge thrown its way in 2021 and continued to deliver best-in-class service, while skillfully managing the 19.4% growth in our LTL shipments per day for the full year. I can assure you that delivering on time, without damage is a significant accomplishment with this type of volume growth. That is why I'm so proud that in 2021, we once again earned the Mastio Quality Award, which recognizes us as the national number one LTL carrier for the 12th straight year. Providing superior service not only allows us to win market share, it also supports our long term pricing strategy. We have consistently focused on improving our yields at the individual account level to both offset our cost inflation and support further investment in our business. This approach has helped strengthen our financial position over time, and allow us to do something that others in our industry have not consistently invest in new capacity. We have historically invested 10% to 15% of our revenue and capital expenditures each year, and we expect to spend approximately $825 million this year. We believe consistent and long term investments in capacity are valued by customers as an integral component of quality service. And these investments are also necessary to support our on-going market share initiatives. We simply never want our service center network to be a limiting factor to growth, which is why we have spent over $1.8 billion over the past 10 years to expand our service center capacity across the nation. We currently have approximately 15% to 20% of spare capacity in our network. Although our 2022 capital expenditure plan includes another $300 million to further expand our service center capacity to stay ahead of our anticipated growth curve. There are of course, two other ingredients in the capacity equation, our fleet and our people. We intend to spend 485 million for new tractors and trailers this year. We would frankly like to spend more but we have been limited by several suppliers that are facing manufacturing challenges. We are fortunate we're fortunate to enter the pandemic with one of the youngest fleets in our industry. And as a result, we can continue to use existing equipment that otherwise would have been replaced this year. This strategy may continue to cost us a little more in maintenance and repair costs as it did in 2021. But we believe our current fleet and these additions will be sufficient to accommodate our expected growth. As we have done in recent quarters, we also expect to continue to utilize purchase transportation to supplement the capacity of our people and our equipment. The final ingredient and the most important piece of our strategic plan is the investment that we continuously make in our people. The OD family of employees grew by 20% in 2021, which including added adding over 1700 drivers and a challenging labor market. We expect that 2022 will be another big recruiting year for OD. While the labor market remains challenging, we are confident in our ability to add to our team due to our outstanding company culture. In addition, we offer a rewarding pay and benefits package and certainly expect to make company record discretionary contribution to our employees\u2019 401K retirement plan. Our long term strategic plan is straightforward, difficult for others to successfully replicate and builds on itself year-after-year. Our success over the years has proven the flywheel effect of our strategic plan and we believe it will spin even faster in 2022. We are encouraged by the opportunities ahead and we are confident that the disciplined execution of this strategic plan will produce further profitable growth and increase shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning. And now Adam will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Greg and good morning. Old Dominion\u2019s revenue grew 31.4% to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 and our operating ratio improved 270 basis points to 73.6%. The combination of these changes resulted in a 49.7% increase in earnings per diluted share to $2.41 for the quarter. Our revenue growth included a nice balance of increases in both volume and yield, which are both supported by a favorable domestic economy. We believe we are currently winning a significant amount of market share based on a comparison of our shipment trends with publicly disclosed information for other LTL carriers. Our LTL funds per day increased 14.3% and our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 16.1% Our LTL revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased 9.2% due primarily to the success of our long term pricing strategy, as well as changes in the mix of our freight. On a sequential basis, fourth quarter LTL shipments per day increased 0.1% over the third quarter of 2021, which compares favorably to the 10-year average sequential decrease of 3.5%. LTL funds per day increased 2.4% as compared to a 10-year average sequential decrease of 1.7%. These 10-year average trends exclude our 2020 metrics for a more normalized comparison. For January, our revenue per day increased 25.7% as compared to January of 2021. This growth included a 7.7% increase in LTL funds per day, and a 16.8% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Our fourth quarter operating ratio improved to 73.6% and once again included improvements in both our direct operating costs and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Within our direct operating costs, productive labor as a percentage of revenue improved 320 basis points, which more than offset the increase in expenses for both our operating supplies and purchase transportation. The increase in our operating supplies and expenses as a percent of revenue was primarily due to the increase in the cost of diesel fuel. We continue to use purchase transportation during the quarter to supplement the capacity of our workforce and our fleet. And we expect to use a similar amount of these third party services in the first quarter. We were very proud that our annual operating ratio of 73.5% surpassed our previous internal goal of 75%. As we execute on a long term continuous improvement cycle for our operating ratio, we intend to follow the same successful approach that we have in the past, which is to focus on density and yield. The spare capacity within our ever growing network allows us to drive additional volumes through our system, which generally create strong incremental margins at the local service center level. We're confident in our ability to further improve our operating ratio and it dropped our internal goal another 500 basis points. As a result, we will now be focused on achieving an annual operating ratio in the 60s [ph]. Old Dominion\u2019s cash flow from operations total $340 million and $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter, and 2021 respectively. All capital expenditures were $165.4 million and $550.1 million for the same period. Greg mentioned earlier that we currently expect capital expenditures in 2022 have approximately $825 million. This total includes $300 million to expand the capacity of our service center network. Although we would increase this amount further if we identify additional properties that fit into our long term strategic plan. We would also increase our expenditures for new equipment if availability improves during the year. We paid $23 million in cash dividends in the fourth quarter. While we did not utilize cash for share repurchases, our $250 million accelerated share repurchase program remained active during the fourth quarter. We utilized $691.4 million of cash for our shareholder return programs during 2021. And that consisted of $599 million for share repurchases and $92.4 million for cash dividends. We were pleased that our board of directors approved a 50% increase for the quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share in the first quarter of 2022. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 25% as compared to 25.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020. We currently expect an effective tax rate of 26.0% for 2022. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we will be happy to open for the floor for questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question will come from Jack Atkins from Stephens. Please go ahead. Jack Atkins : Okay, Greg. Good morning, guys. And thanks for the longer term color on the new operating ratio target. That's exciting. So I guess for my first question, if we can maybe kind of shorter term kind of focus on what you saw in January, Adam, thanks for the for the trends from a tonnage perspective and your perspective. But anything that you could maybe add was whether the first couple of weeks in the month a little bit of a challenge. We've heard that the rise in COVID cases in December and January, presented some challenges for carriers just sort of curious if you could maybe comment on what you saw there sort of within the month, and I'll follow up after that. Adam Satterfield : Sure. And good morning, Jack. There were several things impacting January and certainly every January we deal with whether it's not a onetime event, and it's included in all of our 10-year average trends that we typically compared to similar to the effect of COVID in certain months of last year, when you only look on a one month period. We did have some effect. We felt like both directly and indirectly with customers that were impacted through labor shortages and so forth. And so we saw a little bit of that impact as well during the month and we came off an incredibly strong December. So to talk about December first a little bit just on a weight per day basis. December's tons per day was down 1.1% our 10-year average is a decrease of 9.1%. So from a sequential standpoint, we felt like, we were going to see that that build up in December coming off November that had a little bit of some of the same effects that we talked about earlier. So we expected that, but the timing of Urient [ph] also had a little bit of effect of both helping December, and then starting out that first day of January, being a lot softer. We don't typically get into these half day conventions and so forth, like some others do. But I would just say that first day of the month was certainly not a full normal day, like what we saw for the remainder of the month. So with all that said, we still grew revenue, that 25%. We're really pleased to see that we saw a continuation of the strong yield trends continue in solid volume performance, given all the factors that we just discussed. Jack Atkins : Okay, that's, that's, that's great to hear. And thank you for that. I guess, maybe a longer term question. I don't Adam, I don't know if you are going to take it or Greg wants to take it. But, I would just be curious to get your sense for the trajectory of the growth rate for the LTL market more broadly, not just in 2022 but over the next several years. I think there's a sense that some folks have a concern maybe that some folks have that LTL have benefited from all the supply chain disruption, maybe more so than others. But there seems to be increased shipper demand for LTL capacity, because of e-commerce and a number of other factors. You guys are investing for growth, I would just be curious if you could maybe walk us through sort of your maybe your longer term perspective for the LTL market, not just in 22, but over the next several years. Greg Gantt : Jack, I'll take a shot at that. And I\u2019ll let Adam add to this, but you're right. From what we have seen and from talking with our customers, we expect continued growth. It looks like if anything to see e-commerce is continuing to drive the LTL market. And the industrial economy has been strong. And everything that we see on the horizon is, is we expect continued growth. I want to roll back to the COVID question that you asked prior. Just for everyone's information and I'm sure somebody else intends to ask this. But we have seen our numbers go in the right direction over the last several weeks. And I think it's important to note, I think we've heard the same thing, all the news is as to what's happening around the country, but our trend has been really positive the last few weeks and our cases are really down. And it looks like from our perspective, this thing could be dying out. So hopefully, that's happening everywhere. And I think if it is that'll sure be a boost to everything related to the economy and certainly to conducting business more as normal and a long time since normal. But hopefully we can get back to that. And I'll let Adam add to that longer term growth question. Adam Satterfield : Yes Jack, I would just repeat what Greg said and certainly feel like there continue to be tailwinds to the industry. And we feel like the industry has already been growing above GDP and believe really, that that the industry as a whole could have grown more. But we \u2013 the industry continues to be capacity constrained and that's why we talk about the service advantages that we have in the marketplace, as well as the capacity advantages that have driven much of our growth. And we probably could have grown even faster this year. But it's something that we've certainly taken advantage of all the investments that we've made over time. We've invested a lot in our network, over $1.8 billion, the last 10-years growing our door count over 50%, while our shipment count has grown over the last 10 years about 70% or so. When you look at the other group of public carriers, there's been a decrease in the number of service centers in the industry. So and then for that reason, the other carriers that total shipments managed by the group is pretty flat as well. So we'll see how that continues to trend but there's service value that we add. And I think our customers are starting to appreciate that more when they look through their supply chain in total in leveraging an LTL carriers network. That\u2019s why it's so important that we continue with our yield improvement initiatives to continue to have the financial strength to invest further in our system to allow us to continue to grow with our customers because that's a big piece of the overall quality equation and that serve as well that we deliver they can call on us and they certainly are doing so when you look at our volume performance this year, customers are increasingly calling on us to deliver for them because of capacity shortfalls that they're experiencing through either other carriers or other modes. Jack Atkins : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks again for the time. Adam Satterfield : Thanks, Jack. Operator : And the next question will be from Jason Seidl from Cowen. Please go ahead. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Greg, Adam and team, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to focus a little bit on the yield side. First, the numbers you gave imply, probably the largest sequential 1Q increase, you've seen in a little bit of time. I wondered if you could talk about contractual rate renewals and how they trended in 4Q and how they're looking early on. And then I want to chat a little bit about your length of haul. Growing again, 4Q is that the type of business that you're winning out there in the marketplace? Or is there something structurally going on in the marketplace to lengthen that LOH [ph] that you are seeing? Adam Satterfield : Yes, I think that, on the length of haul, just to address that piece, your question first. Yes, it was a little bit longer. We were at 944 miles in the fourth quarter, but we've been around 935 miles to 945 miles. When you look longer term, we've seen length of hauls decrease, we've certainly seen this regionalization of kind of going back to the longer term question, we believe is regionalization of the industry will continue and we're seeing good growth and our next day and second day lanes. But the last couple of years, there's been pockets of growth in different places. We've had tremendous growth off the west coast, which typically has a little bit longer length of haul with it. So there's just been some different growth and in different areas with certain customers that it's moved it up a little bit, but it's pretty much staying within a fairly consistent band and, and I wasn't really expecting material change from where we are other than eventually getting back to the scene decreasing a little bit. And with regards to the yield performance, for us, we have a long term consistent strategy that that focus was all in trying to achieve yield improvement to offset our cost inflation each year. And, and we need cost plus, because again, it gets back to supporting the investments that customers are demanding from us in additional real estate capacity, as well as into our technologies as well, from a revenue per shipment standpoint, just getting away from the per 100. Because certainly, some of those metrics that change in weight per shipment, the change in the length of haul both had the effect of increasing the revenue per hundredweight, but our revenue per shipment, excluding the fuel was up 6%. And that was a good performance. But overall, we had to see some higher renewals kind of in the back half of the year, our cost inflation on a per shipment basis. And the back half of the year was a little bit higher than what we had anticipated the average cost per shipment for the full year would be and we'll see that trend a little bit higher in the first half of next year and then kind of normalized, but certainly we're continuing to get increases to offset that cost inflation. So those renewals in the back half of this year, has probably been a little bit higher than those in the first half of 2021 that is. And so, it's always just a continuous improvement cycle that we have. We look at each account on its own operating merits the freight that we get and ways that we can improve yield. And that's not always through price, either. So, I think we've been successful. Certainly when you look at that revenue per shipment, cost per shipment, delta in the fourth quarter, and really for the full year as well, just reinforces that that long term consistent approach that we've strived for. Jason Seidl : Appreciate the color thanks for the time again. Operator : And the next question will be from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Adam, can you share that the yield, the yield trends ex-fuel in January and then any thoughts on just that 1Q or seasonality and how you're thinking about that? Adam Satterfield : Sure. So the per hundredweight with the fuel, as we said earlier was between 16.5% at 16.8% without fuels right at 11%. So we're still seeing increasing rates really on the average price per gallon. And as that increase through the year, it's the average in January was up about 39% versus January of last year just for the national average there. So that fuel price component is certainly picking up and going into both the that revenue component, but also getting into the cost as well. And certainly, there's more than just the direct cost of diesel fuel that we use in our operations. As fuel prices go higher, that certainly works its way into tires and other components we have to deal with. So anything that's sort of fuel related, we'll see that same type of inflation or, with that said, and in regards to our costs, typically the fourth quarter, the first quarter sequential is about 100 basis point deterioration. Now one thing to say before I get into, a little bit more detail about that is typically that includes kind of a flattish, when you look at the insurance and claims line, kind of flat performance from 4Q to 1Q. We had a benefit in the fourth quarter, as you could see on that insurance and claims line. And that mainly comes from the actuarial assessment that we do each year, that was only seven tenths of a percent, where we averaged 1.1% to 1.2%, in the first three quarters of 2021. We expect that number to go back up to about 1.2% in the first quarter, give or take. So we've got a little natural drag, if you will, versus our normal sequential performance, if you will. With that said, however, we're still targeting about 100 basis points of change there and plus or minus, certainly, that's just one specific number. But I think that given the strong revenue performance, I think that we can offset much of that. So maybe 80 basis points to 120 basis points is to give us a little range, there will be what we're trying to target achieving in 1Q. And certainly the one key performance, when you look at the average, a lot goes into that the revenue effect like we mentioned earlier can be a little different from one period to the next. And certainly there's the calls that come in, that's not as consistent performance from 4Q to 1Q, like there is and maybe some of the other quarters, just given the natural disruption that happens in those periods. But that natural disruption goes into that 10-year average. Scott Group : Very helpful. And then just last one, if I look over the last five years, your operating ratios improved about 200 basis points a year on average. Do you think that's a realistic way to think about either 2022, or the next several years. I'm just trying to think about when realistically you can get to that sub 70 alarm? Adam Satterfield : And we didn't put a timeline per se on it, because really we're looking for, for profitable growth each year. And some years we get a little bit more revenue contribution. Some years, we get a little bit more margin contribution; they all go into that profitable growth line. And we pretty much played 2021 like a piano [ph] and got a little bit of both revenue and margin. So we were pleased to see that and followed a very successful 2020. So the five year of 200 bips is probably a little bit stronger, given the performance in 2018 as well. When you look over a longer term, it's been more in the 100 basis points to 150 basis points. And we talked about 10 years sequential from quarter-to-quarter. And that's probably been more in that long term. But right now, demand continues to be incredibly strong. So we certainly are expecting another very solid revenue performance here this year. And we're going to be investing dollars, investing significantly for headcount growth, as Greg mentioned. So we can continue to give the same service that our customers expect, and we're going to be adding to our fleet and into our network. So there's a lot of investment that goes into the continuing to take advantage of the market share opportunities that we feel are out there. So it's not, we're not going to give a specific goal for what we think we can do in 2022, but, but certainly the focus will be to produce as much profitable growth as we can. Scott Group : Appreciate the time guys, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jordan Alliger : [Technical Difficulty] FTL, you do start to say some pretty tough comparables as you get into second quarter, particularly around volumes, so industrial production growth 3.5%, 4% this year? I mean, how do you think about high level sort of ability to grow tonnage, I assume on a full year basis. But looking past the first quarter, the second, how you may be thinking about those more challenging comps? Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Jordan, you broke up a little bit. So I don't know if I missed anything at the start. But just in regards to the volume environment. Again, it just gets back to the underlying strength of demand. And certainly, that's all the customer feedback that we've been hearing, coupled with capacity issues and other places of our customers supply chains. When we look at the economic trends, we feel like that, we would expect continued strength with our industrial related customers, as well as the on-going strength with our retail related customers as well. So, we're, we're used to tough comps, if you will. Given our long term revenue performance over the last 10 years, that's pretty much we've produced about 11% average growth in revenues. And even though we'll follow up, what would have been a record growth year of $1.2 billion of new revenue produced last year, we certainly have got big expectations for 2022 just given all those factors. So we'll see how the, the comparisons work out. And I think that if you just assumed normal sequential trends, that would still put us at kind of the high, single digit, low double digit type range. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Operator : And the next question will be from Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please go ahead. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask you about, I guess, price. And I don't know if you want to refer to like contract renewals. But I think you've saw some acceleration in price through the year in 2021. Maybe you see that stay elevated in first half and kind of ease in second half, but wanted to see if you could offer some kind of high level thoughts on where maybe where contract renewals were in fourth quarter? And what you think the profile looks like on price in 2022? And then I had a follow up on [Indiscernible] question. Adam Satterfield : Yes, Tom, we've kind of just stopped talking about contractual renewals, because I've somewhat feel like, that's, that's obviously a very big piece of the overall revenue equation, about 25% of our business is on our tariffs business, and certainly the majority being on contract. But it seems like it's a talking point from the others in the industry, that doesn't always reconcile with necessarily what you see out of the yield performance. But, it all just sort of goes into it, whether it's price increases, other operational changes, that drive yields, and so forth, and the things that we look for, we'll say that, like I mentioned earlier. We expect our, we saw higher cost per shipment in the back half of last year. We expect our cost per shipment this year, to probably be on a net basis, maybe in the 4.5% to 5% range. And that's excluding the effects of fuel but, but it's going to be weighted heavier, we're going to see higher costs per shipment inflation in the first half of the year, and then think that some of those expenses normalized, when we get into the back half and start laughing over where we've recently been seeing inflation in our business. So with that said, certainly the contracts that mature in the first half of the year, they didn't have as much of an increase last year, so they will probably get a little bit more and then those in the back half that maybe got a little bit higher increase reflecting what the actual cost trends were, in the back half of 2021 may not see as much. But overall, the focus continues. We\u2019ve got to look at how our cost inflation is trending, and then trying to target 150 basis points above that. We did the January numbers, I did mention this earlier, but we did take our general rate increase, which is on our tariffs business that was affected the beginning of January. So that was a part of that yield performance that we've already seen to start off the year. Tom Wadewitz : So you think you moved back in second half of the year towards kind of more normal, annual LTL pricing called mid-single digits is that is that a reasonable expectation, if you look towards kind of second half of the year? Adam Satterfield : Again, I think that, we've got to look at how our cost inflation at that time is trending. And, if we're seeing some normalization at that point, then then the expectation comes back. But at the end of the day, we've got to look at each customer's account, the revenue inputs and the cost inputs, and in terms of what we're actually seeing, and how the account is operating, and look at ways to drive improvement in that customers operating ratio. If we can do that by price, that's one way to look at it. There may be other operational changes, new pieces of business, that we may get different factors that that can overall drive an improvement. For us, we're looking at driving a continuous improvement cycle and each customer account and that customer account builds up to each individual service center and those builds to the company. So certainly, we're looking to improve the operating ratio, and that's how you got to go about tackling it. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, that makes sense. If I can ask one more, I guess for Greg, how do you think about the cycle and with respect to. It seems like historically, you probably have some give back in a cycle where you've had strengths in LTL. And aside truckload market, and truckload loosens, that there might be some impact in the cycle historically. Do you think that it\u2019s reasonable to expect that this time? I mean, it does seem like LTL has been the one mode that could add capacity. And it would be natural to think some LTL freight in the market, maybe not for OD but in the market goes back to truckload later this year or next year? You think that's right, or is that? Is it going to be different maybe this time? Greg Gantt : Tom, I can tell you, we don't have any volumes at this point in time to go back to truckload. I think if you look at what we've done and what we've been able to take out over the course of time due to capacity restraints, and whatnot. Most of those type volumes are out of our network at this point. So I don't -- I think the environment for us from that standpoint is extremely positive, as far as we can see through 2022. Certainly things change as you go through the year. But right now, I don't see any volume going over the truckload at all. Not from our standpoint. And, as Adam has mentioned numerous times, we're continuing to add capacity. I would expect that we'll be on a strong trajectory all year along. Tom Wadewitz : Great. Okay, thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will come from Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, operator. Hi, Greg. Hi, Adam. Adam, I just wanted to clarify one question. I guess from Jordan earlier, you talked about high single-digit low double-digits. Maybe I didn't catch it. Was that first quarter full year was it tonnage with a shipment? What were you exactly referring to on higher to single digit, low double digits? Adam Satterfield : I wasn't given any specific guidance there. I was just basically saying that if you assumed normal sequential trends, in our tons that that what about the, if you just roll them out quarter by quarter, what the year might look like? But certainly, at this point we feel like just like what we saw last year that the demand is so strong out there. And we'll see how the year progresses. When in the past, we've typically had, probably about six quarters or so when you look through past growth cycles. We typically have had six or so quarters where we significantly exceed our 10-year trends. And then it kind of reverts back to the average and the average sequential performance for us includes a lot of market share wins. Going back to my previous comment, we've grown our shipments over the past 10-years around 70%. So those 10-year trends include a lot of market share, and we certainly think that given the comparison of our volumes that we've seen to the industry for the third quarter, that's kind of the way things have trended. We have this spare capacity that it's out there that we try to invest ahead of the curve, so that the network is not a limiting factor and we can help our customers grow when we get in these strong demand periods. So we'll see how the quarter-by-quarter is trending as we work our way through 2022. But the one thing we will say is that the underlying demand has not changed. It was consistently strong through 2021. And the customer conversations that we have today indicates that that strength is going to continue for the foreseeable future. Amit Mehrotra : Yes, so that was just more tonnage commentary, by extrapolating current trends and kind of where the year shakes out. So, okay, so I get that. The other question I have is incremental door capacity in 2022. Obviously, all this new capacity that you're putting online, doesn't come on January 1. And so any help around what the kind of incremental door capacity is from these investments, per rata for when they actually come online in 2022, and even 2023, if you could talk about that? Adam Satterfield : We -- I think we've said before that we intend to add somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 to 10 service centers this coming year. We don't necessarily always share the door detail, for example, but when we look, we don't give it year-by-year more for strategic reasons. But if you look over the last 10 years, we've expanded the door count by about 50% in total. So as Greg mentioned before, we've got about 15% to 20% spare capacity in the network. We were fortunate that we started out 21 in a really good spot. So despite the 19.4% growth that we had in shipments during the year, we were still able to keep fair measure of spare capacity out there. So we'll continue to build on that level. We've got a few other things that will happen earlier in the year. Those were projects that already had been in the works, and some that we thought we might have been able to finish by the end of the year, but so we'll get some new capacity out there on the service center side pretty early. And we'll be adding to it pretty, pretty consistently throughout the year. Amit Mehrotra : Okay I wanted to come back, I think to Scott's question on long term margin improvement. I want to kind of approach it a little bit different way if I could. I mean, Adam, you've talked about direct and indirect costs as a way to kind of articulate the inherent operating leverage in the business. I think it was like 25%. Previously, you've obviously made the cost structure looks different now, given the progress that you've made in the pricing initiatives to shouldn't agree. But wondering, it seems like the new baseline operating leverage is kind of 30% plus, versus that 25%? I don't know if you agree with that, or if that's the right baseline to use, that can maybe help in for our pace of margin improvement going forward? Adam Satterfield : Sure, yes. We we've talked about the cost structure in previous quarters. And effectively, our total direct costs, for last year, about 55% of revenue in our overhead was around 19% of revenue. And so some of that overhead, maybe 5% is also variable in nature. So when you look at the total variable costs, and that structure, that revenue growth can give us the incremental margins in the 35% to 40% range, in a short period of time. And certainly we did, I think, 39% for all of last year, so really strong operating leverage year for us. But our story, like I said, it's not just all margin improvement. We want to continue to build up the network to take advantage of the market share opportunities, which we feel are out there, and we want to keep growing the top line which takes investment. And so we know that we need to continue to invest, to keep taking advantage of that revenue growth opportunity and so that, that may call some quarters that the incremental margin might not be in that that 35% to 40% range, and that's okay. That's why we don't manage the business to an incremental margin per se. We're going to do the right things, right, that we feel like build out the network to allow us to keep achieving the top line growth and then have the ultimate effect of also driving long term margin improvement for us. Amit Mehrotra : Make sense. Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate the time. Operator : And the next question will come from Jon Chappell from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning, I'm just going to combine a couple into one because they're kind of all related. Adam, trying to talk about market share in this column and in the press release. Is there any way to quantify how your market share, how much you've taken effectively from the LTL Pie over the last call it five years? And as you look at your service center growth for this year, and I'm sure you're not completely in tune with what everyone's doing. But you probably have a pretty good sense for the market. How much do you think that your setup to take this year? And then the second part of it is, as you think about these market share gains that you've won, especially in the last 12 months, have these been kind of just traditional contract duration, traditional customers, or given the tightness of capacity across the entire logistics here? Are you winning kind of longer term contracts, new types of customers, as you\u2019ve taken share recently? Greg Gantt : I think our biggest wins have come from our ability to service the customers as they see the need. I mean, a lot of our competitors just haven't been able to provide the capacity that we have. And that's what that's my opinion as to why we've taken the share that we have. Just to get back to that share growth over the last five years. And Adam, you may need to help me here. But I was pretty say it's pretty fair to say we've been growing about that share about 1% a year. It's kind of a creep, if you will, it's not really a, a leap by any stretch. But, but it is has been very consistent. And we continue to see that as we get. As far as the service center network and whatnot, Adam mentioned, we're looking at 8 to 10. This year, we've got quite a few in the process. Now the good thing is some of those are, are fairly large, there's a couple big ones in my area that will give us quite a few additional doors. So I think we're going to be in a good spot. We, as I've mentioned, in over the last several years on all of our calls, I think we talked about the places where we're challenged, and we still got places that are challenged to expand and whatnot. But we do have some good ones working and I think we're going to be better off as the year progresses. We'll see how the growth trends and whatnot. But I think we're in a really good spot. And I would expect that that work is going to pay off for us. Jon Chappell : Great. Thank you, Greg. Operator : And the next question will come from Todd Fowler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Todd Fowler : Hey, great. Thanks and good morning. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit. Headcount has been growing faster than shipment count for the past couple of quarters. And I understand there's probably some catch up there. What's your expectation for headcount growth into 2022? And also relative to shipment count. And then just any general comments on labor availability? Thanks. Greg Gantt : Yes Todd. Certainly, we're trying to add labor as we speak there. It has been a challenge, as I mentioned before, but we have been able to successfully add folks and right now we have needs, certainly as we get into the stronger parts of summer season, later in the spring, and certainly through the summer, in the fall, we need to continue to add folks without a doubt. So I would expect that those trends would pretty much mirror our shipment growth, and [Indiscernible] is growth. So I don't expect that to be a whole lot different. But yes, we need to add and those efforts are certainly underway if it\u2019s fallen. Todd Fowler : Greg or Adam, could you I mean, you care to kind of put like a finer point, I mean, should the spread between headcount growth and shipment count, start to narrow, or do you expect us to continue to try and add in front of the shipment growth for the next, kind of foreseeable future? Adam Satterfield : Yes, I think that, we finally just sort of caught back up with it at the tail end of 2021. Then, we'd expect to see, probably the headcount a little bit stronger than the shipment count. Certainly probably for the first half of this year. But when you look over the longer term, those two numbers kind of work in concert with one another. They're pretty matched evenly. And I think that really the top line is what dictates it, Todd, and certainly last year, really going back to 2020. Once the recovery began which for us was in May we were pretty much playing catch up. We\u2019ve had this tremendous volume performance. Really, unlike anything we've ever seen that with the fourth quarter being higher than the third, I mean, just really tremendous recovery since that drop in April of 2020. So we've continued to add people really at levels above what the normal sequential trends in headcount would be. I think that will continue in the first quarter until we get back to the levels where we can support the freight that we're seeing. But we've got to match it to with the, the equipment base that we have. And so it's just something that we've got to manage through as we work our way through the year. But as long as we keep seeing that, that top line, performance and strength coming at us, we're going to continue to try to hire and have the right people in the right place that is efficiently operating, keeping our service metrics best-in-class and taking care of our customer and the lever that will continue to pull. And we think that we'll have to keep using this and 2022 will be the purchase transportation, and we've had to utilize that. I think probably every quarter as we worked our way through last year, we talked about trying to get away from it. And ultimately, we do, we want that number to revert back to that old 2 to 2.5% that was there for our Canadian operation in a truckload brokerage business, where we've got 100% of our line haul network in source and we're using our people and our equipment to service our freight. But until then we've got some good partners and they're continuing to deliver within our service expectations and keep our service metrics best-in-class and, and really just helping us to be able to grow the top line. So we'll continue to pull that lever while we have to. Todd Fowler : Well, Adam, my follow up was on purchase transportation and kind of the expectations in the service. So you covered that one for me. I'll pass it along. Thanks for the time. Adam Satterfield : Thanks, Todd. Operator : And the next question will come from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Bascome Majors : Yes, thanks for taking my questions. On the real estate expansion as some of your peers become more eager to invest in growth, like you've been doing for quite a time here. Are you starting to see more competition at the locations that you'd like to expand in? Or is it really just you versus broader industrial real estate? Adam Satterfield : Yes, it's certainly the latter Bascome. This just, I don't know that it's the competition for real estate. Generally speaking, it\u2019s just being able to find real estate that we need and being able to get it sold and, and get the building done. Sometimes you can find the land and you know it\u2019s the hoops, you've got to jump through to get it zoned and, and meet all the building requirements and all those different things. But trust me, there's a lot of challenges out there. From a real estate standpoint, it's not easy. As we've grown, and as we require bigger and bigger facilities to meet our needs and to plan for years down the road. It's just gotten more and more difficult. But certainly there is some competition in certain locations. And I've talked about that numerous times before. But the competition in certain markets is definitely tougher than others. Some places it\u2019s still relatively easy, we can fund and meet our needs. But there are some that again, are rather challenging, if you will. Bascome Majors : And to that point, you mentioned a couple of locations would be particularly large ads this year. You talk about the geography or timing of those. Adam Satterfield : Yes. One of those is in the Northeast that we've owned for several years now. It's been it was occupied with \u2013 tied up for the lease. We should get that late this year sometime. It's up in northern Pennsylvania. We own it today. But it's not available for the time being but we will get it to think about it. You probably have a little work to do to get it up and running. But that should come on late this year. We've got another fairly large facility in Southern Minneapolis, the southern part of Minneapolis to help us better serve that area. We're up on the north side now and certainly with the growth that we've had in that market, we need to have another facility in the South. It's getting closer like we're just a couple months away from opening that. We're working on a big one that's well underway in Kansas City that'll give us another additional fair amount of doors. So we had a lot of irons in the fire around the country and a lot of good things working. Again, I think we're pretty well positioned from that standpoint. Got a few others that I'll probably rather not talk about at this point, but a lot, a lot of work going on in the real estate department, that's for sure. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : And the next question will be from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ken Hoexter : Hey, Greg. Good morning, Greg and Adam. Thanks for getting me in here. Just to real quick, Adam, to clarify the -- your target. You said moving from 75 to 500 basis point improvement to 70. And then you talked about sub 70? Can you just kind of clarify what the target is an outlook there? Adam Satterfield : Sure it's, I mean 70 is the target that we want to see something start with a six. So it will be 69, or whatever we get to when we crossed that, that line, we obviously blew through the 75, this year, pretty strong and have got a good, good jump on making our way towards that 70 goal. But nevertheless, that's the goal, if you will, at a raw 70. But seeing and know I\u2019ll start with the six. Ken Hoexter : And I think it's still fairly balanced between pricing costs, just as you've been doing. But you mentioned in the opening comments, some maybe seeing some scale of maintenance cost increases, as you kind of extend the life of the fleet. Can you talk about the impact of that we should see in the near term or this year? Adam Satterfield : Well, I mean, there's some trade off there. And when you look at the depreciation expense for example, we're seeing some improvement there, that was at 4.7% of revenue. And that typically runs quite a bit higher. So we're seeing some increased maintenance costs, if you will to maintain our fleet, our average fleet ages up to five years. Now, for our power equipment, it's been as low as three and a half years, when you look over the last five, seven years or so. And so it's certainly a bit higher than then what we would like to see. And, but there's, there's also a little bit of a drag, just in total operating supplies and expenses on the fuel element, the older equipment is not as fuel efficient as the newer equipment. So, that's just something that we've got to keep balance. We'll probably see once we can start replenishing the fleet at the levels that we would like to, we'll see some incremental depreciation costs that will come online that will somewhat offset, the cost that we're seeing in operating supplies and expenses, but it will offset some of the purchase transportation costs that we're seeing. And certainly, I'm sure you're familiar with the, the truck load right environment is pretty strong right now. So those loads that we are moving with third parties, we're paying a pretty fair price for. Ken Hoexter : Lastly, for me, just Adam, I know, you said that the piers hadn't been growing kind of looking back. But I guess somewhat backward, as we've heard a lot from the carriers, they're starting to talk about growing real estate, even our best XPO [Ph] talking door and service center ads that we hadn't heard in a while. Does that give you or Greg, any thoughts on potential pricing pressure that we haven't seen in the past? Greg Gantt : I wouldn't, I don't think so. I think we just got to keep doing our thing and providing value to our customers. And I don't I don't see that as a negative certainly. Adam Satterfield : Generally speaking, I think that can't speak for everyone. And we don't really know other than what we hear from customers. But we anticipated that we would see capacity issues with the industry this year, just based on some internal computations that we go through. And we started hearing that before we got to mid-year before the real rush began. And so I think that there's probably some needs out there. Like I mentioned, we still feel like the industry is growing. And when you look over the last 10 years, there's been a couple of other carriers that have also increased their market share. I think that the industry revenue is continuing to consolidate with the larger national non-union providers, and we think that that trend will continue in the future. But certainly, we've got service advantages as well. And it all comes back to the service value you deliver for your customer and we think we've got an unmatched value proposition that wins market share for us and we're going to continue to execute and keep giving the very best service to our customers. And we think that that will drive the market share and feel in the real estate capacity that that we continue to expect to add. Ken Hoexter : Great stuff. Appreciate the time and thoughts. Thanks Greg. Thanks, Adam. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow up on that last point about the market and competitive dynamics. I guess, I'm just trying to make sure I understand how you guys might respond to the extent that there is maybe a larger push by some of your competitors into the market. You guys have always been extraordinarily disciplined with the way you approach the market. So I'm guessing in a scenario where maybe some of your competitors get a bit more aggressive to expand. And obviously, there's a lot of demand out there. So I don't know that necessarily has an impact on the pricing dynamic. But I guess, I think I know the answer has been kind of curious your take on how you would adapt to a market which might actually see more, sort of push for market share from some of your competitors than we've historically seen over the last several years? Adam Satterfield : Well, I think what we'd expect, Chris is that the, the industry has been very priced disciplined, really going back to the last slowdown in 2016. And so I think that we've seen some margin improvement by some of those other carriers. If they don't have capacity, maybe they'll continue to follow our lead in terms of continuing to consistently try to increase price. When you look at the current environment, much of the revenue growth is coming by yield from other carriers. I get back to the third quarter performance. We grew our shipments 19% on average, the public carrier group was up 1%. So that wide delta in volume growth, we want to have that volume contribution, and we've got the capacity to grow both volumes and yields, whereas we've seen in prior growth periods, like 2017, 2018, what we've seen this year, or 2021 rather, the other carriers that don't have barely any capacity to grow throughout their entire system, just take advantage of the strong demand and increase yields which if they're increasing faster us because again, our pricing approaches one that's long term and consistent customers know what to expect. If other carriers are increasing their rates faster than us and closing some of that price gap, that service value looks better and better. And so, I think that's what we've seen in the past. It's what we would continue to expect to see to see that wide outperformance if you will against the other public area group data that we see on average. Chris Wetherbee : Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks for your time. I appreciate it. Operator : And the next question is from Bruce Chan from Stifel. Please go ahead. Bruce Chan : Hey, good morning, gentlemen thanks for squeezing me in here. I know you mentioned that there's no truckload freight to give back the cycle. And that's good to hear. But as we think about some of your comments earlier Adam around regionalization and secular growth in e-commerce, how are you thinking about your freight mix characteristics? And do you think he can kind of keep those as they are? Or do you think there may be some pressures on, length of haul and shipment density as you start to grow your share and expand your network over time? Adam Satterfield : Yes, I mean, it's certainly, we constantly communicate with, with our customers, and including third party logistics companies to try to navigate through and foresee the types of changes that are coming down the line. That goes into some of our thinking in terms of how we expand our service center network as well, and, and where we're building facility. So we certainly foresee some of those, those changes that have been happening over the last 5 years, 10 years continue. I think they've all been favorable transfer of the LTL industry, and I think we're certainly maybe benefiting more than anyone. And the reason for that and some of how we think some of this market share growth we've seen recently will be very sticky is that there's a increased premium that's being placed on service quality. And when you think about especially as low as inventory balances are right now, shippers have got to get their product on the shelves. And so they're increasingly relying on a carrier that can give 99% on time service performance and not have damages. And if you're delivering into one of the big retailers that have these chargeback programs in place then it puts an even more importance if you will on that, that service value. So that's how we're winning share in that that retail segment of the market. Certainly we've still got our healthy mix of industrial freight and think that that will continue to grow as well. But we're really winning across all segments, if you will, with direct industrial and retail related customers and seeing tremendous growth with our third party logistics customers as well. So, but we think that those trends are going to continue and the importance on total service value will continue to rise. Operator : Thank you, Bruce. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg cans for any closing remarks. Greg Gantt : Thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions. And please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks and have a great day.

Please go ahead, sir. Greg Gantt : Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. The OD team successfully launched another year by delivering first quarter results that included new company records for both revenue and earnings per diluted share. We began the year with significant momentum in our business and expected that we would continue to win market share in 2022.  This expectation has already become reality, as the 32.9% increase in revenue was the fifth straight quarter where we recorded double-digit revenue growth. We also improved our operating ratio to a first quarter company record of 72.9%, which drove our seventh straight quarter of double-digit growth in earnings per diluted share. Our revenue growth for the quarter included a 17.4% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight and a 12% increase in LTL tons per day. The improvements in both freight density and yield created operating leverage that allowed us to improve our cost categories as a percent of revenue which also drove the improvement in our operating ratio. Density and yield are the key ingredients to long-term improvement in our operating ratio and both generally require the support of a favorable domestic economy. We expect to further improve each of these 2 elements as we work through 2022. Demand for our superior service has remained consistently strong, and we do not see that changing in the foreseeable future based on recent conversations with both our customers and our sales team.  We continue to receive feedback regarding the general lack of capacity within the LTL industry. This feedback is not unexpected, given that the LTL industry has seen a net decrease in the number of service centers over the past 10 years, at least for the public group, excluding OD. Customers also appear to be dealing with lower inventory balances than they would prefer, which can result in missed revenue opportunities for them. We have unfortunately heard similar stories from our suppliers and have seen little improvement with their inventories this year. We believe these issues are driving many new customers and increased shipments from existing customers to OD.  Despite all of the general industry and supply chain challenges, Old Dominion has continued to maintain our service center capacity to support our customers' growth. This has been and remains an integral piece of our value proposition, and we are well positioned to benefit from the continued strength in demand for both our superior service performance and network capacity. We have opened 3 new service centers this year and currently have approximately 15% to 20% excess capacity. These additions were part of our 2022 expansion plan that targets an additional 5 to 7 new facilities this year. While our service center network is in good shape, we are continuing to work on the other 2 pieces of the overall capacity equation. We increased our average number of full-time employees by 18.5% during the first quarter, and we expect to continue hiring additional employees during the second quarter to support our anticipated growth.  As the capacity of the OD team increases, we would like to reduce our reliance on purchased transportation. To accomplish this, however, we will need to increase the capacity of our fleet. While our 2022 capital expenditure plan includes approximately $485 million for equipment. We are experiencing delays with the delivery of new equipment. These delays were anticipated and limit our ability to effectively match the receipt of new equipment with the expected seasonal increase in our volumes. As a result, and similar to 2021, we will operate existing equipment that would have otherwise been replaced and use purchased transportation as needed to support our growth. As part of our effort to deliver best-in-class service for our customers, we remain committed to ensuring that each element of capacity is in place to support our ability to win long-term market share. As we continue to manage through the short-term challenges within the current freight market. We will also maintain our focus on long-term opportunities for our business by continuing to execute on our long-term strategic plan. This plan has helped us achieve a 10-year compound average growth rate in revenue and earnings per diluted share of approximately 11% and 24%, respectively.  As part of this plan, we have consistently invested significant resources to support the doubling of our market share over the past 10 years. This has included a significant investment in our OD family of employees to help ensure that each employee is motivated and rewarded for providing superior service to our customers. We believe that consistently providing customers with superior service at a fair price and regularly investing in our people, equipment and network capacity to stay ahead of anticipated volume growth will support our long-term growth initiatives. As a result, we are confident in our ability to continue to produce further profitable growth and increased shareholder value.  Thanks for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the first quarter of 2022 increased 32.9% to a company record of $1.5 billion. While our operating ratio improved 320 basis points to 72.9%. The combination of these factors resulted in a 52.9% increase in earnings per diluted share to $2.60 for the quarter. Our revenue per day increased 30.8% as the first quarter of this year included one extra work day. This growth was balanced between increases in our volumes and yield, both of which continue to be supported by a favorable domestic economy. We continue to win a significant amount of market share as demand for our superior service and available network capacity to remain consistently strong during the quarter. As a result, the year-over-year growth in our revenue and volumes continued to trend above our longer-term averages. LTL tons per day increased 12% and our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 17.4%. While changes in our freight mix contributed to the increases in this yield metric, the 10% increase in our LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, reflects the success of our long-term pricing strategy. Our consistent strategy is designed to offset cost inflation, while also supporting further investments in capacity by focusing on the individual profitability of each customer account. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the first quarter increased 1.2% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. With LTL tons per day decreasing 1.4% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 2.2%. Our revenue per day performance during the first quarter, both with and without fuel surcharges, exceeded our 10-year average sequential trends, although our volumes were below our 10-year trends. It is important to remember, however, that our 10-year average trends include the doubling of our market share. As a result, there may be quarterly periods where sequential performance may be below our 10-year trends despite solid year-over-year performance. The first quarter is a good example as we believe we won a significant amount of market share and produced solid profitable growth as a result.  The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the first quarter were as follows : January decreased 5.8% as compared with December, February increased 5.1% versus January, and March increased 3.6% as compared to February. The 10-year average change for the respective months are an increase of 1.6% in January, an increase of 1.7% in February and an increase of 5.6% in March.  While there are still a few work days that remain in April, our revenue growth continues to be very strong and reflects the favorable demand environment described earlier by Greg. Our month-to-date revenue per day has increased by approximately 28% when compared to April of 2021. We will provide the actual revenue-related details for April in our first quarter Form 10-Q.  Our first quarter operating ratio improved to 72.9%, with improvements in both our direct operating costs and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Within our direct operating costs, improvement in our salaries, wages and benefit costs as a percent of revenue effectively offset the increase in expenses for both our operating supplies and purchase transportation. The increase in operating supplies and expenses as a percent of revenue was primarily due to the increase in the cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products.  We improved overhead cost as a percent of revenue during the first quarter, primarily by leveraging our revenue growth and controlling discretionary spending. As mentioned on our fourth quarter call, we expect our core inflation, excluding fuel, to be between 4.5% to 5% for the year, with higher inflation in the first half of the year that is expected to moderate in the back half. We believe our fuel surcharge program is effectively offsetting the increased cost of our fuel and our yield management strategy is effectively offsetting cost increases in other areas. As we continue to experience cost increases related to our real estate network as well as with our equipment, parts and repairs, it will be critical to maintain our focus on productivity while continuing to control discretionary spending to minimize the overall effect on our cost per shipment.  Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $388.7 million for the first quarter and capital expenditures were $93.7 million. We currently anticipate our capital expenditures to be approximately $825 million this year, which includes $300 million to expand the capacity of our service center network. We utilized $438.4 million of cash for our share repurchase program and paid $34.2 million in dividends during the first quarter. The total amount for share repurchases includes a $400 million accelerated share repurchase agreement that was executed during the first quarter.  Our effective tax rate was 26.0% for the first quarter of 2022 and 2021. We currently expect our annual effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the second quarter 2022.  This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question today comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore. Jonathan Chappell : Adam, if I could start with you, in the last few quarters, you can kind of throw all of your historical seasonal OR trends out the window, just very robust pricing environment, you're doing much better than 10-year trends. As you start to anniversary some of these big pricing and tonnage moves over the last several quarters, do you envision a return to kind of the long-term trend margin seasonality? Or some of these vast market share gains that you're making going to continue to make those trend in a more favorable momentum? Adam Satterfield : Well, I think that certainly, some of the quarters, those trends are very consistent. We've talked before about the first quarter and the fourth quarters can be a little bit more movement versus the average, just given the variability at times with revenue trends in those periods and certain costs that trend in various ways in those periods as well. But I think we've certainly performed very well the last couple of years and produced a lot of operating ratio improvement.  I think regardless of the seasonal sequential changes from quarter-to-quarter, we always talk about the -- over the long term that we generally expect we've seen and would expect to continue to see 100 to 150 basis points of operating ratio improvement. And a lot of that gets back to our focus with our pricing philosophy. We try to achieve revenue per shipment growth of 100 to 150 basis points above our cost per shipment inflation. And when you look over the last 10, 15 years, including fuel in both of those metrics, that's what we've been able to achieve. So certainly, some years when we've got significant revenue growth like we saw last year and certainly, in the environment that we're in right now, where we're growing revenue at about 30% in the first quarter, a little over that. Certainly, it's a good environment to keep driving improvement in the operating ratio maybe above those longer-term averages. But over time, that's certainly part of the focus is to continue with that same type of mentality with our yield management philosophy. Jonathan Chappell : Got it. And a follow-up for Greg. Last quarter, you specifically called out some of the issues you've had with some of your suppliers being unable to get the equipment that you would have liked to have to grow and maybe some of the elevated maintenance expense associated with that. But given how low your CapEx was in 1Q vis-a-vis your full year number. Are you expecting some of these supplier constraints to kind of lift so you'd have a very back-end loaded spend and get the equipment that you're looking for by the end of the year? Greg Gantt : Yes. I'm not sure it's going to get a whole lot better. I mean, the equipment that we had planned to receive this year was planned to be delivered later in the year than we would normally take it. Typically, we would start taking trucks, especially late in the first quarter on through the early fall. And then the delivery would pretty much -- deliveries would pretty much be over. We would have what we had purchased for that calendar -- particular calendar year. And this year, it's just -- it's a lighter build from the get-go. That's what we were told. So that's the difference. It's just coming a little bit later. We're getting a little bit less than we had hoped to get, and we're getting a little -- getting it later. Operator : And the next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins : So I guess, maybe to start, Adam, if we could go back to your April commentary for a moment, obviously, there are a lot of changes taking place in the freight markets kind of broadly. I was just maybe curious if you could kind of comment on April, relative to March so far and how it's trending versus either your expectations for April as you were kind of going into the months or just relative to normal seasonality, just sort of curious if you could maybe kind of give us an update there on how the month has trended versus plan. Adam Satterfield : Yes. It's, I mean, a continuation of strong revenue growth, 28% is about where we are. Continuing to see strong yield performance, which that has certainly continued throughout the first quarter and same types of trends into April for sure. So it's a reflection of our ability to continue to win market share. We talked about it earlier that, as we continue to have conversations with our customers and with our sales team. We continue to get positive feedback as it relates to demand for our service. And many of these conversations center on the lack of general capacity within LTL and LTL is different from truckload.  And I think a lot of shippers have seen the value of LTL. And certainly, the e-commerce effect on supply chains, there's been movement of freight within LTL that we believe will stay, and we believe we'll continue to see tailwinds on over time for the industry, and we think we can be the biggest participant in winning share as that industry continues to grow, much like we've been the biggest share win over the last 10 years. So certainly, that's our plan is to keep investing ahead of growth and keep delivering service value that's better than anyone else in our industry. We've got an unmatched value proposition and our customers continue to respond to that. And so that will be our focus, is to continue delivering best-in-class service and making sure we've got the capacity to support our customers' growth. Jack Atkins : Okay. No, that makes sense. And that's great to hear on April. So I guess maybe for my follow-up question, just kind of going back to Jon's point on operating ratio and sort of thinking about seasonality into the second quarter. Typically, over the last couple of years, you guys have seen between 350 to 400 basis points of sequential improvement, 1Q to 2Q. Adam, is there anything to kind of keep in mind as we sort of think about this year, in particular, moving from the first quarter to the second quarter? And do you think that, that type of normal seasonality is the right way to kind of think about it? I mean, that would imply an operating ratio in the upper 60s. So just sort of curious if you could maybe give us some thoughts on that? Adam Satterfield : Sure. Certainly, in the first quarter, when you look at some of the sequential changes that we had from 4Q. We outperformed what the normal seasonality was and what we had talked about our target was going to be coming into the fourth quarter -- or first quarter, rather, from the fourth. And some of the benefits that we saw really a variance from the 10-year trend were in our miscellaneous expenses. Those costs were lower. Those normally are about 0.5%. They were lower and we got some benefit, normally see an increase. They are general supplies and expenses, also were favorable to our longer-term trend.  And some of those reflect control over discretionary spending like we talked about. And then some other things, were just -- there's times where you get some favorability and especially on those miscellanies expenses and other times where it could go the other way. It's usually 0.5% plus or minus. So we'd expect some of these items that potentially could increase.  And I would just say, if you kind of go back to the fourth quarter and look at seasonality from fourth to first and then second, that would have put our operating ratio just above a 70%. But I can tell you, we'd be pleased with that, but we're really focused on being able to see an OR that starts with a 6. So anything that starts with a 6 is going to be good by us. Operator : And the next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Unknown Analyst : James on for Allison. Actually, just to clarify on the previous question, you expect both those to normalize moving forward and not necessarily was it a reset in this quarter in terms of those expense levels? Adam Satterfield : Are you talking about the general supplies and expenses and the miscellaneous expenses? Unknown Analyst : Correct. Adam Satterfield : Well, like I said, miscellaneous generally is around 0.5%, and it was at 0.2% of revenue in the first quarter. So we would expect that to move back to where it's historically trended now again. It's not to say that some of the favorable trends that we saw in the first quarter couldn't repeat. There's a lot of elements that go into that miscellaneous expense. But it's more normalized around that 0.5%. And then certainly, in some of the things in the general supplies and expenses we could continue to see some increases there as well. But no specific guidance, if you will, to say what that's going to be, but it wouldn't be unexpected to see that increase, if you will. Unknown Analyst : Got it. Just wanted to clarify. And you called out that you had 15% to 20% capacity in terms of service centers and you also had some issues with the equipment deliveries. But overall, how much capacity do you think you do have in your network at the moment across sort of the 3 metrics you've track -- or you've encouraged us to track around employees, trucks and service centers? Like do you actually have capacity to take on incremental volume from here? Adam Satterfield : Well, certainly, that's our expectation is to continue to produce growth. And the piece of the capacity equation that you always have to look at is on the service center side. It takes doors to process freight within LTL. And so that is the more determinant figure in terms of how much from the levels where we currently are that we can continue to grow. And we generally like to have somewhere 20% to 25% excess capacity. So our CapEx plan this year includes about $300 million to further expand the capacity of our overall service center network. We've opened the 3 facilities so far this year, and we've got more that are slated as we proceed through the year to keep expanding the number of service centers and some of those dollars are increasing doors at existing locations as well.  Now when it comes to the people side of the equation and the fleet, much like you've seen in our numbers over the last couple of years, the lever that we pull there is we have to use purchased transportation if we need to supplement one or the other of those pieces of the capacity equation. Certainly, we've stepped up the increased use of purchased transportation. We were actually pleased to see that the outsourced miles that we had in the first quarter have actually trended down versus where we were in just the fourth quarter of last year. So we're continuing to make progress there as we continue to add people to our OD family. We had an 18.5% increase in the number of full-time employees. So we're continuing to be successful there and attracting new people to our business and retaining those that we already have. And then we're continuing to balance the capacity of our fleet.  As Greg mentioned in prepared comments, there's multiple ways to do that. We're having to hang on to some of the older equipment. We will get some relief later in the year we hope, with deliveries of what's been ordered, if you will. But again, we can use purchased transportation as needed to supplement there. So I think we've got those pieces covered, and we're continuing to give 99% on-time service performance with the claims ratio between 0.1% and 0.2%. So it's best-in-class service despite the significant volume of growth and processing significant growth on top of the growth that we had last year. Operator : And the next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Chris Wetherbee : So Adam, maybe we could talk a little bit about yields and sort of how you maybe see that playing out over the next couple of quarters. I think we're starting to hit some of the tougher comps when we look at revenue per hundredweight ex-fuel, starting in the second quarter. I guess maybe two questions here. First, is the step-up of the comps kind of happened immediately in April? So is that sort of the trigger as you move from 1Q to 2Q were already beginning to lap those sort of more challenging comps? And I guess the second part, bigger picture piece of the question would be just how you think about sort of the pricing environment, your ability to sort of continue to get price, you talked about inflation being 4.5% to 5%. So presumably, you're sort of targeting somewhere in that, call it, 6% to 6.5%, maybe 7% range. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about it? Adam Satterfield : Yes. Certainly, the increases that we need in the first half of this year are going to be higher, just like we talked about the expectations on our inflation. We started seeing really the inflation pick up in the middle of last year. And so as contracts were maturing in, we were having to start asking for more. We look at the current environment as those mature and what we're seeing and what we expect. And we're always making predictions for multiple things, what our volumes are going to be, as well as our cost and what our customer needs are, but certainly started seeing acceleration in some of those renewals in the back half of last year, and those need to continue as we move through the first half.  But we are starting to get some normalization on some of the weight per shipment trends. At this point, our weight per shipment is flat with where we were last year. We've seen a decreased weight per shipment over the last year or so as well as an increase in the length of haul. So both of those changes in mix have been supporting that overall reported yield number, and making it look stronger than just the core increases that we're getting.  But we continue to target cost plus. That's been our long-term pricing philosophy. It's been consistent and one of our customers know and can understand and we'll continue to execute on that same type of philosophy as we progress through the year. But with some of those mix metrics normalizing, when you just look at kind of normalized trends, it would -- if you look at kind of normal seasonality, if you will, just sequential increases from this point forward, it starts coming down. The year-over-year starts getting to the higher single digits to kind of mid-single digits and eventually normalizing, if you will. But certainly, right now, we're able to get increases that are covering our cost inflation, and I think you can see that in our numbers. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate that. And you mentioned that the weight per shipment has been ticking up sequentially here after, I think, bottoming kind of in the third quarter. Should we likely to be sort of up on a year-over-year basis as we move forward? Adam Satterfield : Well, right now, like I said, we're flat. So as we progress through the second quarter, then we could. If things just sort of hold steady, if you will, from a mix standpoint, then certainly, we would start seeing some increase, and that's kind of the point of you might start seeing the reverse of what we did last year, where the mix change puts a little bit of pressure on that reported revenue per hundredweight.  Certainly, in the third quarter, that was our low watermark. I think we were at 1,538 pounds on average in the third quarter of last year. Right now, we're trending somewhere in the 1,575, so between 1,550, and 1,600 pounds, but it's been a little bit heavier on that scale over the last few months. Operator : And the next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Adam, I just want to clarify just a couple of things. The 28% increase in revenue in April, is there any way just directionally to break that down between fuel and tonnage and sort of underlying yields? And then I was also just a little confused about your commentary around the second quarter OR about normal seasonalities of 70-something, but you're hoping for 60-something. I just -- I wasn't -- I was little confused, so if you can help there. Adam Satterfield : All right. I'll try to clarify that first. I'll just talk about our revenue growth, and we don't want to necessarily give the details. We'll wait unless the month settle out. But like I kind of referenced earlier, in March, we saw revenue per hundredweight, excluding the fuel, that was up about 9%. And that's about the same year-over-year change that we're seeing. From fuel, we never really get into the breaking down fuel contributions, but the average price per gallon in March is about the same in April. And so it's averaging about a little over 5 -- about $5.11, $5.12. So there's about a 62% increase in that DOE price per gallon in March, and the same type of increase that we're seeing in April. So we'll have similar contributions, if you will, there. So the overall yield continues to show considerable strength and the comparisons start looking a little bit different, if you will, on the volume side. And when you look at last year and what the revenue growth was, we had total revenue growth of about 16% in the first quarter of last year, and it was 47% in the second quarter. So those will certainly change as we progress through the second quarter, the comparisons get a little bit tougher. Which is why we're extremely pleased to see the strong revenue growth at 28% in April. But you'll continue to see contributions like that. The yield is certainly driving a lot of that revenue growth for us right now, but seeing very solid volume performance as well. In terms of the operating ratio, don't want to give specific guidance per se, but my point was we certainly had some favorability in the first quarter. I mentioned the general supplies and expenses and the miscellaneous expenses and that those could revert back. So there certainly could be some pressure on that normal sequential change that we see from the first to second quarter. One other thing that was beneficial was we had lower fringe costs in the first quarter than what I expected for the year, and that's fringe cost as a percent of our salaries and wages. So I would expect that to kind of normalize back to where I thought it would be for the year. So there may be a little bit of pressure on a couple of those items. Time will tell and we'll see.  But my point was if you just took normal seasonality from the fourth quarter, certainly, we had big outperformance in 1Q. But if you took normal seasonality from the fourth quarter and ran it through to the second, that would have put our operating ratio right in a 70.2%. And we'll see that would imply less seasonal improvement than what we normally expect. And what the point of the matter was if we operate anywhere that starts with a 6, it fits a 69.9%, we will certainly be very excited to see that kind of number.  We're sitting here like Burt Reynolds and Jerry Reed trying to do something that they said couldn't be done. And we think that we can get it done. But certainly, if it comes out that it's about 70.1% or 70.2% that's producing very strong profitable growth as well. But nevertheless, not throwing necessarily a specific target out there, but just saying what could be done with some of the numbers and how they might normally train it. Scott Group : Okay. Yes. Most of the others get excited about starting with an 8. You made a comment about LTL is different than truckload. So, I'm guessing that LTL is very different than spot truckload, but there's a lot of focus on spot rates right now. What -- how does slowing falling spot rates impact in any way your tonnage outlook, your pricing outlook? Adam Satterfield : Well, from a tonnage standpoint, that was the point we wanted to make was that what's going on in truckload right now. We are already last year, had taken a lot of the heavier weighted shipments that might be considered spillover freight in prior periods and had worked those out of our systems. So we don't have those same pressures, and I don't think many of the other LTL carriers do either, just looking at some of the statistics. I think freight demand had been so solid and influx of freight into the LTL world that many carriers and certainly, us, we can speak to specifically, were just focused on long-term LTL freight, not something that might be more transactional here today going tomorrow type of thing if truckload capacity loosened up.  So we're not seeing the same type of pressures and not really hearing about it from an overall competitive landscape either, that there's some movement of freight going back into the truckload world. But certainly something that we'll continue to pay attention to, and we're talking very frequently with customers and our sales team. But again, that's consistent feedback that we're receiving from all parties is that demand continues to be solid.  And certainly, numbers are what they are and part of the conversation in our prepared remarks talking about 10-year trends and so forth, we've doubled our market share over the last 10 years. And that doesn't always come in a linear fashion. So we might have a month where volumes underperform for a monthly period, our 10-year average trends, and that's just certainly not something to get overly concerned about. And we saw some of that in the first quarter. We underperformed, if you just look purely from a 10-year average sequential standpoint, on the volume side, but we produced a lot of revenue growth and good profit growth as a result.  So we continue to be encouraged by the overall environment, and the feedback that we're hearing from customers and our sales team and want to continue to do what it takes to take advantage of the volume flows that may come our way this year. Operator : And the next question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Jordan Alliger : Curious, realizing that things are very strong today. If we do or were to go into a slower economic situation later this year into next year, maybe negative growth. Given the headcount increases you've had and obviously, wage increases across the sector, I mean, how flexible or nimble do you think you guys would be sort of in the other direction in terms of pulling things back and can you with wage increases and headcount? Greg Gantt : Jordan, we've done this in the past. I mean, I don't think anybody likes to manage through a downturn or a recession or whatever you want to call it, but we've done it in the past. It's surely not a lot of fun and you have to make hard decisions at times. But we've managed through the worst recession ever in 2009, at least in my pretty lengthy career, it's probably the worst ever. We managed through that fairly well. Then we did it again in '16 and through a flat year in '19. So we've geared up, then we've geared down and gear back up and this business is up and down. It always has been. But if we have to manage in a downturn, I've got all the confidence in the world we can manage through that. As Adam mentioned, though, so far, so good this year, our trends are good. Our feedback from customers are -- is very strong. We've had 2 of our top 10 accounts in the building in the last couple of weeks. And they're both very positive on their business and their customers and these were logistics companies, by the way. They're huge, and they manage an awful lot of dollars. And their outlook is very strong at this point in time. I think our standing with these particular accounts and with our accounts in general, our standing is better than ever. And at this point in time, we're not thinking about a downturn. If we have to, we will. But that's not where we are today. Operator : And the next question comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Fowler : So I wanted to ask on where you think you're at from a headcount growth standpoint. I know you've had success in adding headcount, but it's been about above tonnage and shipment growth now for the past couple of quarters. You have some comments in the release about continuing to add headcount in 2Q. Do you think you're getting to the point where headcount is caught up with where your tonnage levels are? How do you think about continued headcount growth into the back half of the year? Greg Gantt : Yes. Todd, I think we are -- we -- I think we have pretty much caught up. We still have some needs in some places, but we're much closer than we've been probably in the best shape we've been in over a year. So happy with that, happy with where we are. And we'll just have to see how the volume trends continue. If we continue on our current growth trajectory, then we will have to continue to add some as our seasonality dictates, but I think those needs will be fewer certainly than they were in the last year or so. But yes, we're in a better spot and feel pretty good about our standing today. And that wouldn't be a bad thing to see that continue to level off a little bit. Todd Fowler : Yes. No, understood. That's a good comment. That's helpful there. And then, Greg, just a follow-up, in your prepared remarks, you had a lot of comments around shippers really realizing the value of the LTL service proposition. I guess, I'm curious, are you seeing any shift in your mix as far as kind of your core customer base? And I know it would just be around the edges not a big wholesale shift, but kind of different shippers using LTL relative to where you've been historically. And when you think about the tonnage growth that you've been experiencing do you think that most of that's because of your available capacity? Is there something else within the industry that's driving that? Greg Gantt : Todd, not that I know of, not at all. I think it's just continued growth from existing accounts. Certainly, we continue to take on new business. We have a very significant group of sales folks working out there every day. So we do continue to gain some new business from the reports that I'm seeing, but no normal growth from existing customers. I think just the continued confidence that they have in us and the service performance that we've given in the past and they like it. Their customers need that. Their supply chains, as Adam mentioned, supply chains are challenged and putting that product on the shelf more important now than probably ever. Operator : And the next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : A couple of follow-ups. One to the kind of downturn planning question. I'm sure you guys are aware that most of your peers and a lot of investors have been trying to figure out what your secret sauce has been for years and why there isn't one answer. I think one of the big elements is your continued kind of investments almost irrespective of the cycle. But I just wanted to get a sense of what benchmarks you guys would look at in terms of turning the wick up or down on the incremental growth plans a -- if there is a downturn, are you going to put your foot down and actually accelerate investments? Or again, what are some of the metrics you look at to start pulling back? Adam Satterfield : Well, I mean, I think you've got to look at past performance to a degree to see how we react. And as Greg mentioned earlier, we've taken the opportunity in the past and some of those slower periods like you mentioned, to, in some ways, accelerate our investments. And I mentioned earlier that we're probably a little bit behind. We're at 15% to 20% excess capacity. We like being at sort of 20% to 25% on average. And we're a little behind that target range is given the significant volume growth that we've had.  So we look through a longer-term wins, if you will, and try to project out where we think our market share and our volumes might be in the next 5 to 10 years. It's not just always in the here and now because certainly, you can't execute when it comes to real estate investments in a very short period of time. Oftentimes, and we didn't necessarily see this in the last slow cycle in '19 like we thought we might have, but in prior periods in downturns, we've seen some opportunities come our way that were attractive investments from land opportunities, existing service center opportunities. So certainly, if something becomes available in an area that's on our long-term road map for where we want to go, then yes, we would take advantage of something like that.  But it's just always sort of looking at what's in front of you, if you will, from an opportunity standpoint and then us thinking about the longer-term opportunity where we want to be, where we think we need to have capacity to support the continued growth within our network and to be able to keep our service metrics where they are today. Ravi Shanker : Got it. That's good color. And just a follow-up on the topic of keeping an eye on the long term and growth investments. There have been a number of important developments in the path to commercialization of autonomous trucks and obviously, the pressure on most companies to kind of strengthen their ESG footprint with electrification is growing as well. I would love to get an update from you guys on kind of what you're seeing out there, what your investment plans are in both these technologies and maybe kind of the -- what the rollout part looks like, especially if you're going to invest in a downturn? Adam Satterfield : Well, we certainly have one, we've just recently disclosed our first ESG sustainability report. So we were proud to get that out. And I think that was a means to show some of the long-term improvements that we've made over time with operating efficiencies and overall improvements in our miles per gallon and so forth, and we'll continue to track towards some of the goals that we have internally to continue to improve those metrics. And one of the key pillars of our foundation for success is continuous improvement, and that means multiple things, continuous improvement in multiple areas. But as it relates specifically to electric vehicles and autonomous and so forth, we'll continue to stay engaged with manufacturers to see what's coming down the line. We would like to try to test some of the equipment, and we actually ordered some equipment, but we're still waiting on the delivery of the truck. And so I think that goes to some of the pressures that the OEMs have in terms of what actually is being produced and is planned to be produced in the near-term. We're still from all the feedback we get from specs and capabilities, don't believe that electric trucks as they exist today, really fit the operating model of an LTL network, at least how we run our business.  But we felt like we wanted to have a seat at the table and that was why we put an order in to get something and actually put it in place to operate and to be able to give true feedback in terms of what the limitations may or may not be. So -- but we'll continue to stay engaged with all of our suppliers in that regard to see as things change and where it may make sense to try to integrate some of that technology into our network as it makes sense or not. Operator : And the next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Appreciate it. So I just had a couple of questions. Adam, just a clarification, did you give April tonnage sequentially from March versus seasonality and year-over-year in April? Can you give that if you hadn't already? Adam Satterfield : No, we haven't provided the detail. Consistent with what we've done in the past, we'll give it with our 10-Q, but just gave where we're trending from an overall revenue standpoint and then gave a little extra color on kind of what our yield trends are doing. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Fine. And then I guess, bigger picture question, you guys are knocking the cover off the ball on many metrics. Your stock is down 25% this year. I don't want to make too big of a deal of near-term or midterm stock movements, but everybody is debating right now what the peak to trough earnings decline could look like in a very tough macro scenario. And I think part of that reflects the trough to peak has been so robust for OD and many other companies as well. So I guess the question is, if I look at the industry, the industry has done a tremendous job of understanding its cost structure a little bit, pricing rationally relative to that, those investments they've made in understanding their cost structure. So do you think that the industry, from a pricing discipline perspective, is just better than it's ever been because of some of those specific investments? And do you think the price -- there's risk in a downturn that the industry pricing just going to breaks down? Just talk about how the pricing discipline for the industry is today versus how it's been kind of been any time in the past. Adam Satterfield : Well, I certainly think it's been more disciplined, and you can go back to 2019 and in particular, the second quarter of 2020 as well. I mean, that was a pretty steep drop for everyone from a revenue standpoint. And no one knew how long of a drop we were going to be in. But I think that there was a lot of discipline that was shown. And I think it gets back to -- there's certainly a lot of value that an LTL carrier can offer and there's a lot of expense to running and to expanding an LTL carrier's network. And we certainly have seen that over the years. We talk a lot about the cost of expanding our real estate network, the land cost facilities where we have to lease some of the rent rates have almost become prohibitively expensive, but something I thought that way about a couple of years ago may now look like a bargain. So it's one of those things where we've got to continue to build that type of cost escalation into our pricing plans. And I think we'll continue to certainly see our numbers and our philosophy, no change with respect to the cost plus pricing that we've displayed over the years.  And I think that it's likely that we'll continue to -- we've seen discipline from the other carriers and wouldn't expect any change in that regard. And the industry now, I mean a lot has certainly been written lately about what's going on in truckload. But you've got almost 70% of the LTL revenue that's in publicly-traded companies now. And so it doesn't take long to see what everyone is seeing and doing and certainly, probably more important to see what actually is going on for management teams versus just reading reports off of the Internet that's sensationalized, maybe a little bit more. But I don't think you can all necessarily extrapolate what you're seeing in some of those reports to the LTL world. Operator : And the next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Ken Hoexter : Greg or Adam, can you -- maybe thoughts on the impact of purchased transportation on quality controls expense? And what is now outsourced, as you talked about maybe growing a bit although, I think, Adam, you mentioned it was down in first quarter versus fourth quarter, but it sounded like you were -- you needed to scale that to meet your growth targets going forward? Adam Satterfield : Yes. Certainly, we were able to use the purchased transportation in an increasing manner as we went through mainly 2021, started stepping it up a little bit in response to the acceleration in volumes that we saw in the back half of 2020. And I'm speaking of the sequential acceleration just to be able to keep pace with the growth and expectations from our customers. But we've got good carriers that we've used to supplement mainly within our line-haul operation. And it's overall still pretty minimal in terms of the outsourced miles.  Certainly, we saw the cost increasing, if you will, as that rate environment was increasing. But we were able to work those third parties into our network and keep our service metrics high, while responding to significant volume growth from customers last year. And we saw maybe a slight uptick in our claims ratio. That was probably more or somewhat reflective of using third-party truckload carriers versus our 20- and 28-foot pup operation and all the claims prevention tools that we have.  But when I say it uptick-ed, it uptick-ed from 0.1% something to 0.16% that just rounded to 0.2%. So we're talking very minimal increase there. And that's part of the overall value that we provide to our customers. And Greg mentioned it earlier in his prepared comments that part of our value proposition is having capacity. When you look through prior cycles, look through 2017 and 2018, we were able to grow with our customers right now. And when you look at the other carriers, at least public carriers in the back half of last year were pretty flattish from a volume standpoint.  So we're able to come in and demonstrate value, not only with the service quality that we offer but being able to provide capacity when no one else can. And so that takes investment. It takes investment in the real estate of fleet and our people. to make sure we've got that flex capacity. And certainly, we always try to stay ahead of the game as best we can in that regard, but certainly pleased that we're able to deliver that for our customers. Ken Hoexter : Great. I guess for my follow-up, let me just start off with the premise. You talked about doubling your share, but I guess, 1 or 2 of your public peers were kind of closing service centers and kind of maybe shrinking their business, and that's kind of changed, right? So most of your peers are now adding service centers and doors, everybody's kind of set new targets out there. Do you still see the LTL market is structurally growing share within the entire trucking market? And then if so, I think a lot of demand questions coming to you now is, where do you see it first, right? Where do you see -- when you see a role, is it the consumer? Do you not see it because e-commerce growth has changed that within the dynamic that you're still growing and taking share, so you wouldn't see that impact? Maybe just set the stage for the dynamic of what goes on in a market these days relatively within the LTL market? Adam Satterfield : Well, we've talked about this before, but in our business, the way we try to manage and project out, we always have a baseline forecast for the year. And then we have scenarios with growth above that baseline and scenarios where the volumes are below that baseline, and we try to have a plan for both. We have that baseline plan and then how we're going to execute in either side of that scenario. And all we can do is continuously look at our numbers and have continuous conversations with customers. And certainly, we've had years where we've been above and below our baseline scenarios and you just make operational decisions from that point forward.  And part of that is the way we structure our network. We give -- each of our service center managers has got control in terms of managing their headcount and running their operation as needed in terms of adding to or are pulling back on some of the additions that they're making depending on what the environment is like and -- but it just takes constant communication between us and our customer base. And oftentimes, a lot of that is communication with many of our third-party logistics customers, 6 of our top 10 largest customers are 3PLs, and they're a fair amount of our overall business, and they generally have a read on what's going on and if there's mode shift and other things. And we still get favorable feedback from them with respect to the expectations for volumes this year. And so that kind of goes into our baseline and maybe why some of our conversation and thinking might seem a little bit different than what others might be talking about with respect to overall transportation this year. Ken Hoexter : Great. And your thought, just to wrap that up, the thought within the LTL market, do you still see it structurally taking share within the -- in the trucking side? Just to understand it like -- yes. Adam Satterfield : Yes, we do. I feel like it will continue to grow. And right now, we've got -- when you look at all the industrial numbers, those are all favorable for sure, and we're seeing good growth. Our revenue growth in the first quarter was pretty balanced between both our industrial and our retail-related business. We're continuing to see consumer spending. But irrespective of that, there's freight demand for LTL carriers and shippers that this e-commerce effect on supply chains that are leveraging the network that we've built out in moving freight if it's a manufacturer that is moving freight. In yesteryear, it may have been one full truckload of goods to a regional distribution center that may be 10 different fulfillment centers in that same region. And we can fill one truckload basically, one full van of goods at that same manufacturer. But they're now leveraging our network as we distribute those goods throughout our system and to that ultimate fulfillment center.  And so we think that type of change will continue to drive volumes into the LTL industry. And I think that given the investments that we've made and the requirements too, from the big box retailers for their vendors shipping product in, most have on-time-in-full or must-arrive-by-date type of programs. And certainly, it's a focus on the on-time deliveries and no damages. And when you've got the best metrics like we do, that's how we can add further value to our customers by making sure that they show well on their vendor scorecards with their customers. And that's been a piece of the market share that we've won over the last 10 years, and we think that, that trend will continue going forward. Operator : And the next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Thomas Wadewitz : Yes. It's Tom. Sorry, I was on mute there. I guess a little bit of a follow-up on that last one. What the kind of consumer goods spending and potential weakness seems like a key point of concern. So what does your mix look like broad brush? I know sometimes it's hard to be overly precise. But if you say, well, the 2016 cycle, when we saw weakness, we had kind of x amount consumer and y amount industrial, and then maybe in 2019 and today, has it skewed a lot more towards consumer? Or how do you think about a high level, that mix of your book that's if you want to put it in industrial and consumer or if you wanted to include other buckets? Adam Satterfield : I mean, it's still more weighted to industrial than retail. About 55% to 60% of our revenue is industrial related and 25% to 30% is retail related, but it's -- that's probably moved up the spectrum closer to that 30% threshold. And I mentioned that we've seen a lot of good growth in our -- with our retail customers and we have. I mean, that's been a big part of the story. But we continue to see good growth in market share with our industrial customers as well. And there have been periods where that retail was growing a bit faster, but both are growing for us, and we're still seeing good share there. So it's -- that retail component has crept up a little bit, but our good industrial business has grown as well and has continued to somewhat keep pace. Thomas Wadewitz : Are you hearing -- I don't know if this is the type of -- if you have clear input from customers on this. But are you hearing a difference in the outlook between those 2 customer segments or the consumer-related customers more cautious and the industrial side is more aggressive? And I guess, I think, Greg, you commented on inventories, too, that you thought inventories were still light. I don't know if there's a difference in kind of urgency for industrial versus consumer? Adam Satterfield : No. It's -- we look at the inventory to sales ratio, and that continues to be low and really reconciles the feedback that we're getting from customers, be it on the retail or the industrial side that inventory balances are lower than what they prefer them to be. We have an awful lot of conversation about the number of back orders that many are dealing with, and in some cases, missed opportunities where they simply haven't had product on the shelf for ready now if it's a online purchase, if you will. And so I think that's something that Greg mentioned earlier that we're seeing and hearing not only from the customer side, but we're seeing it and feeling it from our supplier side as well.  So both kind of go hand in hand and many of our suppliers are also customers. So we're seeing that across the board, if you will. But that's why we think that even -- I mean right now, consumer spending continues to be strong. I think household balance sheets are good and maybe consumer confidence is not as high as it has been. But we still feel like freight demand can continue for past any type of consumption slowdown just given the fact that we feel like inventory balances need to be built back up. And we continue to believe that long term, we'll see a higher inventory to sales ratio than perhaps where we were, pre-pandemic. Operator : And the next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Bascome Majors : Not to beat a dead horse with another hypothetical recession scenario, but -- and it's clear that you don't think there is a structural change to the investment you've been able to invest in -- or I'm sorry, to the situation you've been able to invest into and make a tremendous amount of return over the last 10 years. But I'm curious, what -- as you think about scenarios, not just the kind of scenario analysis you talked about in a single year, but in that 5- to 10-year plan where you're looking where to invest and where to buy land and where to build more capacity, what would it take to maybe change that strategy? Is it seeing less discipline in pricing at your peers? Is it a consistent run of sub-seasonal tonnage versus the share gain you've gotten historically? I'm just curious what you would have to see to actually make a change in the way that you approach the market price long term. Greg Gantt : Yes. Bascome, if -- again, a big if, and I know it's a hypothetical, but if we saw a major downturn of some kind, and all of a sudden, we had excessive capacity, maybe we would look to do something different. But to tell you the truth, as Adam mentioned earlier, sometimes in a downturn, it provides the best opportunity for you to go out and do some things in certain markets that are extremely difficult to get them done. And that maps an opportunity for us and give us that very, very difficult place that we desperately need.  So I hate to talk too much about hypotheticals, but we'll certainly take advantage of the market if it provides some opportunities for us. We've got to be opportunistic. I've talked about it in the past, how difficult it is now to acquire land in certain parts of the country, how difficult it is to get building started and whatnot. And I think we'd be terribly remiss if we sat back and said all things that really slowed down, and we shouldn't do this. And if you can flip the switch and build a facility in 6 months or even a year, that's one thing. But when we know in some of these markets, it's 2, 3 and 4 and 5 years to get something accomplished. You've got to be opportunistic when those opportunities are there, you've got to strike and you've got to take advantage of them. So I'm not sure that anything would drastically change our outlook and our strategy at this point. I think we've had a fair amount of success, I think you'd agree with that. What we've done, it's worked, and we've continued to put ourselves in a good position to take share and honestly, I don't see that changing. If we were at 30% share, something crazy, but we're still at a 12% market share. So we think there's still a lot of upside for growth from our standpoint. And again, I think it's critical that we take advantage when that opportunity provides. Adam Satterfield : Just to add a little bit more color to that, too, and reinforce the point. If we had not made the decisions to invest in 2016, we wouldn't have been able to take advantage of the revenue opportunities that we had in '17 and '18. And the same is true in 2019. If we had listened to everything that we had read at that point and had pulled back and not continued to execute on our CapEx plan, then we wouldn't have been able to enjoy the growth that we saw last year and what we're seeing today. So it takes investment during those slower times to kind of build up that excess capacity to be able to participate in these really strong market environments.  And I think that's why you've seen us have a little different performance. It's a different strategy. But certainly, we've been able to participate on the upside the market swing more so than anyone. So as Greg said, we feel like we've got a really long runway for growth ahead of us, and it's just going to continue to take that continuous investment cycle whether we're in the middle of a market upturn or if things are slower, that's just something we've got to maintain our focus on and make sure that we're continuing to expand the network overall. Operator : And the next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Patrick Brown : So we've talked to some developers and it sounds like labor, materials, a difficult zoning environment is actually capping some square footage growth in the broader industrial real estate market. Obviously, you earmarked $300 million in CapEx on real estate. But Greg, you kind of talked about it, but how confident are you that you will actually be able to spend that this year? Greg Gantt : Well, I'll be honest with you, Tyler. I'm maybe a little more concerned. We're going to have opportunities and exceed that number. But we'll just have to see. We've got an awful lot of projects in play. So we'll just have to see what opportunities present themselves. And I can tell you at the price of land nowadays that we can reach that budget pretty darn real quick. So it's a challenge, but I think we'll get there, honestly. I think we'll be all over it. Patrick Brown : Okay. So that actually kind of plays into my second question. It's a difficult question, but I think it's a really important one. But how much would you say the cost to build a like-for-like door today is versus pre-COVID? I mean, how much has that increased just with all the material cost increase? Just anything directionally would be helpful. Greg Gantt : Yes. It's relatively significant. I'm not talking about properties now. I'm just talking about materials, I did see something from our real estate folks recently. And it's probably in the 20% range, give or take, some materials or more than that, some less, but the cost of everything, be it concrete, steel, any and all materials has definitely increased relatively significant in the last year to since the pandemic. Everything is up there. Patrick Brown : Okay. That's very helpful. And then, Adam, a quick question, just a clarification. So does the propane that your forklifts consume qualify for CNG tax credits? And if so, didn't those credits go away year-over-year? And was that an OR drag in Q1? Or is that not material? Adam Satterfield : You're very perceptive asking something like that, but that credit did go away. That credit has sort of come and gone at different times. But at this point, I think it's gone. We'll see if it comes back or not. Operator : And the next question comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Unknown Analyst : This is Matt on for Bruce. Congrats on the quarter. With respect to China's COVID lockdowns and potential for some increased port congestion later this summer, given some CBA negotiations, we were curious if you guys are seeing any customer change in their ordering or perhaps contracting patterns in order to maybe get in front of this? Greg Gantt : Yes, Bruce, I can't comment on that. I have not heard that. I expect that will be an issue if it continues. But yes, what we're hearing from over there, it's not good, and it's a locked down Beijing and as long as well as the rest of the port cities that they have already, it's definitely going to be an impact, but I have not heard that, not from our sales folks or our customers to this point. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude the question and answer session. I would like to turn the floor over to Greg Gantt for any closing comments. Greg Gantt : Well, thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions, and feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and I hope you have a great day. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Thank you for your cooperation.  At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead sir. Greg Gantt : Good morning and welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. I am pleased to report that the OD team delivered strong profitable growth during the second quarter, which resulted in new company records for revenue and profitability. Our revenue increased 26.4% to $1.7 billion, while earnings per diluted share increased 42.9% to $3.30. We also improved our operating ratio by 280 basis points to 69.5%. This is the first time in our company's history that we have produced a sub-70% quarterly operating ratio. We achieved these results by continuing to execute on our long-term strategic plan, which has guided us for many years and throughout many economic cycles. The disciplined execution of the business fundamentals that form this plan have supported our ability to double our market share over the past 10 years. We are confident that continued execution on this plan positions us to win additional market share over the next 10 years. The foundation for our ability to win market share is our relentless focus on providing superior service at a fair price. Our on-time service performance was 99% in the second quarter, while our cargo claims ratio improved to 0.1%. These service metrics reflect the efforts of our OD family of employees who maintain a steadfast commitment to delivering value to our customers each and every day. It appears that service quality is becoming even more important to customers when selecting a carrier which is why demand for our service has remained strong. This is a trend that began to develop with the economic recovery during the second half of 2020 and it continues today as many shippers are still struggling with supply chain issues. As a result, we believe our customer relationships have strengthened as we do our part to help our manufacturing customers keep their facilities running smoothly, while helping our retail customers keep products on the shelf and available for sale. Our value proposition also includes having sufficient capacity to support our customers when they need it the most. We currently have approximately 15% to 20% excess capacity within our service center network and we expect to open multiple new facilities during the second half of this year. These new facilities as well as various other expansion projects that we expect to complete should increase the amount of our excess capacity towards our longer term target of 25%. We remain committed to the ongoing expansion of our service center network, which we believe is important, regardless of the short-term macroeconomic outlook. Expanding service center capacity can take a significant amount of time, which is why we have historically been proactive with respect to our expansion efforts. This unique strategy has created a capacity advantage for us in the marketplace, which becomes more apparent to shippers in tight environments, like we have seen in the past couple of years. With over $700 million of year-to-date revenue growth through June, we are on pace to exceed $1 billion of revenue growth for the second year in a row. We simply could not have achieved these types of numbers without the consistent investment in our service center capacity, as well as the continued investment in our fleet, technology and the training and education of our OD family of employees. Our team has shown tremendous flexibility over the past couple of years in response to significant changes in our business levels. And I am confident that this team will continue to build on its success. We have created one of the strongest records for long-term growth and profitability in the LTL industry, by executing on our long-term strategic plan, by providing superior service at a fair price and having the capacity to stay ahead of our growth curve, we believe we are better positioned than any other carrier to produce long-term profitable growth, while increasing shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning and now Adam will discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Greg and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue growth of 26.4% in the second quarter was driven by the 22.6% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight and 2.8% increase in LTL tons per day. Demand for our superior service remained strong during the quarter, which helped support the steady trend with our volumes and consistent yield improvements. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the second quarter increased 11.4%, when compared to the first quarter of 2022, with LTL tons per day increasing 0.7% and LTL shipments per day increasing 1.7%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes an increase of 9.6% in revenue per day, an increase of 7.4% in tons per day and an increase of 7.8% in shipments per day. At this point in July, our revenue per day has increased by approximately 18%, when compared to July 2021, which continues to exceed our long-term average growth rate. As usual, we will provide the actual revenue-related details for July in our second quarter Form 10-Q. Our second quarter operating ratio improved to 69.5%, with improvements in both our direct operating cost and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Within our direct operating costs, improvement in salaries, wages and benefits, as well as purchase transportation cost as a percent of revenue, effectively offset the increase in our operating supplies and expenses. The increase in operating supplies and expenses as a percent of revenue was primarily due to the increase in the cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products. We improved our overhead cost as a percent of revenue during the second quarter, primarily by leveraging our quality revenue growth and controlling discretionary spending. As we move into the second half of 2022, we have areas of opportunity to drive further improvement in our financial results. We will continue to focus on obtaining the yield increases, necessary to improve the profitability of each customer account. We will also maintain disciplined control over costs to keep our cost inflation on a per shipment basis to a minimum. Our team is now appropriately sized and most of our service centers to support our anticipated shipment trends. And as a result, we believe we should start seeing improved productivity throughout our operations. The stability of our workforce has also allowed us to reduce our utilization of third-party purchase transportation and moved closer to the fully in-sourced linehaul operation that we prefer. We believe this is one of many key factors, creating the service advantage we have in our industry, all of which comes back to helping us win long-term market share. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $427.3 million and $816.1 million for the second quarter and first half of 2022 respectively, while capital expenditures were $229.4 million and $323.1 million for those same periods. We utilized $293.5 million and $731.9 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the second quarter and first half of 2022 respectively, while cash dividends totaled $33.8 million and $68 million for the same periods. Our effective tax rate was 26.0% for the second quarter of 2022 and 2021. We currently expect our annual effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the third quarter of 2022. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jordan Alliger : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I was wondering, if you could talk a little bit about the price environment. Obviously, there are some concerns out there about \u2013 more than some concerns about moderation in demand and volumes and you've some of your rates of growth have probably slowed as well on that front. Can you maybe talk about ex-fuel sort of the core price thoughts as you move through the balance of this year? And have you had discussions with shippers, or if they come to you and started to talk about things as they approach their next contracts? Thanks. Greg Gantt : Yes. Jordan, so far we haven't seen much of any at all of any customers asking for cheaper rates, or any kind of exception pricing or anything such as that. I think from what we can tell the industry is extremely disciplined. I think you know over our history we've been more than extremely disciplined. And I think that will continue to be our focus. And right now that's what we're seeing throughout the industry. So I think that's good for all of us. So, we'll see but so far very, very positive from that standpoint. Jordan Alliger : And then just a follow-up on fuel and fuel surcharges, I know the mechanisms are supposed to work as a pass through. Obviously, fuel surcharges have generally ramped up for the industry pretty quickly maybe even faster than the cost of diesel. Can you talk about the impact on P&L from the rising fuel environment? Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Jordan, the way our program is designed, we really want it to be neutral to the bottom line as fuel goes up and down. And certainly as contracts come up in each period and they come up in every quarter for us. But as they come up we look at what the current fuel price environment looks like and then we try to stress test both up and down to see what that individual customer's overall revenue contributions might look like, and being the same for what their costing looks like. And so we try to do the best we can to make sure that that customer's individual account profitability understanding all the costs that go into the model for each individual customer account will come out positive, whichever way the fuel might trend. So I think that, our surcharge has certainly been effective with offsetting the increased cost of diesel fuel, and certainly that's having a direct effect on other petroleum-based products, but there's also a lot of indirect effect as well. That's why we continue to see our cost going up, and it's why we've got to continue to be disciplined with our yield management program. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Greg, there's been this thought that as trucking capacity truckload capacity starts to loosen, and especially as we've seen some major retail pre-announcements that LTL has been this massive beneficiary with the only capacity in town, can you kind of detail your book of business a little bit? And how much you would consider that's on your network today being non-traditional LTL freight? And have you seen any shift in your market share either up or down let's call it since mid-May when this whole retail fear started to really emerge? Greg Gantt : Yeah. Jon, I'm going to let Adam address that. But obviously, there's business that moves back and forth. And it's extremely hard to measure. But I think Adam's got a better handle on those specifics details than I do. Adam Satterfield : Yes, Jon, just to give a little bit of detail, certainly, as those announcements came out last quarter from certain retailers, we've been addressing that question, but we've got many customers that ship and receive that are beyond those two big box retailers. But nevertheless, our book of business is still 55% to 60% industrial. And I think the industrial-related customers and when you look at certain macroeconomic factors in that industrial economy is they're continuing to expand and we probably got a little bit more growth out of our industrial-related customers in this most recent quarter than on the retail side. But our retail, which is 25% to 30% continues to perform strongly as well. It's just a little bit below the company average, but we're still seeing nice growth there. So it's something that we'll continue to work through though, and we believe we've got opportunities with each of those pieces of our business overall. We don't have a lot of truckload spillover-type business in our network. We worked incredibly hard last year, to make sure, when capacity was at a premium that we were allocating capacity more so to traditional LTL shipments and customers that were tendering those to us for the sense that whenever the truckload environment freed up a little bit that we wouldn't have this swing of freight going back into that market. And traditionally you see more of those shipments would be in our spot quote network. That used to be about 5% of our overall revenue. It's probably about 1.5% at this point. And those are shipments generally that existing customers have and that they're asking for something different from us so to speak. But we feel good about demand. We've talked about that. We've had a lot of customer engagement in recent months and we're hearing good things from our customers. They continue to demand service quality. We've worked really hard for multiple years on improving and strengthening our value proposition. And I think we're seeing that come through with the strength in customer relationships that we have right now. And so as a result we're not losing business. The volumes are a little bit flatter but I think you can just look and some of that may be demand for existing customers' products. So we feel good about everything our customers are telling us and just continuing to work and manage through to where the volumes are currently trending as we try to manage all elements of capacity within our business. Jon Chappell : That's helpful Adam. Just for my follow-up to Greg. Obviously the economy has changed a little bit since the start of the year. You mentioned you already have -- you still have 15% to 20% spare capacity today and still have the ambitions to grow the network as you set out back in January. Have you thought at all about tempering some of that door growth in the back half of this year as the economy becomes a bit more murky, or is this really your time to shine and invest when others have to scale back and that kind of just helps with the longer term market share? Greg Gantt : Yeah, absolutely. It's the latter Jon for sure. Sometimes our opportunities are a little better when it slows down. And sometimes you just have better opportunities when it's like it is today. So we can't stop. I've talked about it before how difficult it is to expand your network, how long it takes, how lengthy the process is in certain locations, some certainly way worse than others. So we can't quit. We want to continue to grow that share and we know we've got to continue our efforts on a consistent basis to have that tight capacity when things get tight like they have been in the last 1.5 years two years. Jon Chappell : Great. Thanks Greg. Thanks Adam. Operator : The next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead. Jack Atkins : Okay, great. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. So I guess maybe to, kind of, go back to the June and July commentary, could you talk about what June tons per day were on a year-over-year basis? Could you maybe give us that number? And then Adam I know we're going to wait until the Q comes out to get full details on July, but any sort of sense for -- or any commentary you can share about how July tonnage is maybe trending versus normal seasonal patterns? I think that would be helpful for folks. Adam Satterfield : Sure. On June, our tons per day were flat basically with where we were last year. And so on a sequential basis, it was pretty flat as well. And with respect to shipments, we -- actually the shipments per day for June were -- on a year-over-year basis were down 0.7%. On a sequential basis we were up 0.6% versus May. And as it relates to July, we are trending up. Our revenue overall was up about 18%. And looking at the yield component of that, we don't like to give the full details. We used to. And if things move 10 basis points off what we had said that the story could take a different turn one way or the other. But our yield trends right now if you look at revenue per hundredweight in July it's up about 7.5% so you can kind of get into what the volume trends will look like. And to point out before anything is written about yield that's a little bit below where we were for the second quarter. But we're going to see some changes in the mix of our freight as we compare to the third quarter of last year that was the lowest point for our weight per shipment. We were seeing sequential decreases there and in the third quarter, the overall average was 1538 pounds there. So we're still trending at about 1,560 or so pounds in July. It was right at 1,570 in the second quarter. So as we start to see more of an increase in that weight per shipment. Certainly that's usually lower revenue per hundredweight. So they'll have a little bit of an effect there. Jack Atkins : Okay. And that 7.5% is ex-fuel correct? Adam Satterfield : Correct. Yes. Jack Atkins : Okay. I just wanted to clarify that. And then I guess for my follow-up, I guess this one's for you as well Adam. But just -- is there a way to maybe think about operating ratio trends sequentially into the third quarter? I think typically there's a little bit of degradation just seasonally 2Q to 3Q. As we've been talking about for the last two years, it doesn't feel like anything is following normal seasonal patterns anymore though. But would just be curious to get your sense for how we should be thinking about operating ratio trends sequentially if there's any puts and takes to maybe think about there? Adam Satterfield : Sure. Yeah. So it's normally about a 50 basis point increase from the second to the third quarter. We've got some different things going on this year. And one thing in particular is in our general supplies and expenses. We've got some -- we don't want to necessarily say what they are at this point, but we've got some exciting new things that we're doing from a marketing standpoint where we'll see more cost in the third quarter -- the third and the fourth quarters than what we saw in the second quarter. So there's -- expecting about a 40 to 50 basis point increase in those costs, as a percent of revenue from the second to the third quarter, just mainly due to the timing of some of these programs. But -- so that would kind of take normalized up to about 100 basis points much like we talked about at the end of the first quarter call our miscellaneous expenses have been trending below what that normal average rate. That's usually about 0.5 point. So might see that revert back to average. That's kind of what I've been anticipating. So somewhere in that probably 100 to 150 basis point range I feel like it's kind of just a normalized target for us and that is off a base of 69.5% just to make sure everyone saw that. Jack Atkins : Absolutely, we definitely saw that. Well, thanks very much for the color. I'm really appreciating it. I'll hand it over. Operator : The next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : I'll just kick off with that comment. Congratulations on the margins guys. That was a pretty incredible achievement. Maybe to just start off with a big picture question related to that. How do you run the business? Do you run it for top line growth, EBIT growth? Do you have a margin target? Do you have an incremental margin target? Kind of what's your north star if you will in how you run the business? Greg Gantt : All of the above. Ravi Shanker : That's easy. Adam Satterfield : No. I mean, certainly we've got just some broad measures that we look at. For one, any dollar that we invest needs to have an appropriate return with it. But as we talk with our customers we look and we think about what our long-term market share opportunities are. And then that dictates the investments that we need to make. Certainly when you look at our strategic plan, it starts with giving good service, and to give good service that supports our yield management which then produces the cash flow that we can reinvest in capacity and to reinvest back in our employee base that's really what drives the service products. So -- but we don't want to just grow for growth's sake. We feel like we want to produce profitable growth. And that's the reason why we talk about the long-term margin improvement that we feel like we can continue to generate. We laid out an annual operating ratio goal of below 70% when we finished the fourth quarter last year and certainly doing it for one quarter shows that it can be done, but we've just got to continue to work at it. And there's nothing magic that will make that happen. It will just be continued disciplined execution of our plan, and a focus on a continuous improvement cycle that we have. And it takes every employee coming in every day, thinking about what they can do to make this company better, whether it's improving our service and revenue opportunities or trying to take cost out of the equation as well. So we want to continue to produce profitable growth. We've got a good track record of doing it. We think when we look out over the next 10 years we've got tremendous opportunity there. And that too should create increased shareholder value for us. Ravi Shanker : Understood. And if it were easy everyone would be doing it. Maybe a second question on the macro, obviously a lot of red flags out there on inventory levels, what are your customers telling you about what their inventory levels look like? And what do you think is a potential risk to the cycle in the back half? And maybe if you can distinguish that between industrial and consumer end markets that would be helpful. Adam Satterfield : Yeah. Like what I was saying before, we feel good about what we're hearing from our customers if you will. And it's really things are playing out exactly like we thought they would. For the last couple of quarters, we've talked about the fact that customers were telling us good things that supported the demand trends that we were seeing and what we were hearing from customers and that we felt like that if consumption did slow and it had the effect for slowing overall GDP, that freight demand could remain strong. And certainly we feel like that's what we're seeing and what we continue to hear from our customers. And so, we've had a lot of engagement like I mentioned with them over the last few months. And we're still hearing overall that generally inventories are lower than what they need to be. Many of our customers are still dealing with record numbers of back orders that they've got to figure out how to get labor and other -- fixing other supply chain issues to make sure they've got all the parts and pieces to produce finished product to fulfill those orders. And so, for that reason, it's something that we think freight demand can continue to remain steady and support steadying us with volumes, as we continue to move through this year. But a lot of people have just got issues they've got to continue to work through and we want to be there to continue to help them and make sure that, if it is one of our manufacturing customers, we're continuing to help them and taking supply chain issues off their platform. And if it's a product that needs to be available for sale, certainly, if you're selecting a carrier with 99% on time and claims ratio of 0.1%, we certainly are going to provide the service that our customers are demanding. Ravi Shanker : Got it. And then, just one very last follow-up on fuel. I know you said earlier that you're looking for fuel to be net neutral to EBIT. But I think you're doing a nearly 50% incremental margin on fuel surcharge revenues. I'm just trying to better understand this. Is it just a timing thing? Is it something that's going to -- just from a modeling perspective, how do we think about fuel with the volatility here and kind of maybe moderating in the back half? And what that does to your overall incremental margins? Adam Satterfield : Well, I think, that it's -- who knows what's going to happen with the price of fuel, but we're certainly in the camp that we hope it tracks down for the overall health of the economy. And I think you've got to look back, if we get into a declining fuel rate environment, the impact that that might have when you look back in 2015-2016 was kind of the last period where we saw some pretty big decreases there in the fuel rates. And just like I mentioned before, if we get in that declining rate environment we'll be looking at contracts as they come due and looking at lower fuel surcharge contributions, but lower fuel cost as well. And I know everyone likes to try to take the fuel out of both the revenue and on the cost side, but the reality is, it's in the revenue that we're trying to collect and it's in our expenses as we pay our payables. And so, it's something that we've got to account for. And it's why when we talk about our long-term yield management philosophy, we include fuel in both the revenue per shipment and the cost per shipment. And if you look over the last 10 or 15 years, with fuel being moderately higher or moderately lower when you look on an average basis over that period, we've been able to exceed our cost per shipment inflation between 100 and 150 basis points. And so in some individual quarters that may look a little different than others, but we've got a lot of long-term customers and that's how you've got to look at things from a customer relationship standpoint is, overall, what are those inputs on the revenue and cost side and how can we continue to create some positive delta there to help us continue to reinvest in the capacity back in our business, because no one else is investing in service center capacity like we are. And that's part of the value proposition, so we can help our customers grow. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thank you, so much. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please, go ahead. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Good morning. It's Tom Wadewitz. I think, Adam, you talked about head count and you said you kind of have the resource you need and can probably be steady for a while. I think when you've added a lot of people in a short period of time, there's opportunity for them to kind of learn the system and get better at what they do. So how do you -- how should we think about the potential impact to your margin or to different cost buckets if we have kind of a stable tonnage backdrop and a stable head count framework for you the next couple of quarters? How might that productivity affect margin and which cost lines might improve? Greg Gantt : Yes, Tom, I'm going to try to answer that for you. But I'll say this, we've been through a tough time, not just OD, but the entire LTL industry with the growth that we've experienced in the last year-and-a-half, two years. Since the fall of 2020, it's been a handful for all of us to respond to our customer needs and people requirements, equipment and all those kind of things. We've hired an awful lot of people, somewhere in the 6,000-plus range, when you look at all -- across all employees, dock, drivers and everything else, but it's an awful lot of additional head count. And in that comes an awful lot of inexperienced folks that we've had to deal with over the last couple of years. So while I don't think anybody would say they really want things to slow down, certainly I don't. I mean, its fun when you're busy and you've got challenges, trying to accomplish all the things you want to accomplish. But at the same time when we get into these leaner times and we start to flatten out like we are now, it's not all bad. You can step back and start to refine some of your processes, you end up with certainly better trained employees and whatnot, they understand what to do, how to do it. You're not adding to the list of folks like you were back in the last couple of years. So it's not bad by any stretch. And certainly, our platform productivity, our P&D productivity, maybe some of the aspects of line haul load factor and whatnot, those are included as well, but we can improve in all of those areas. It also gives you some time to look at your clerical processes and whatnot. What's good, what's bad, is there some technology out there that can help you with those kind of things. So, there's just an awful lot of advantages to not being so crazy busy like we've been. So, definitely positive from that standpoint. Again, nobody wants to see it slow down, but certainly, we look at the positive aspect of it, and what we can accomplish while it's this way and be better when we come out of it on the other side certainly. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. And I guess the second question is really just kind of a clarification. I know you talked a bit about July. You had a couple of questions on that. Is the tonnage implied in that something around flat, or does it imply down a little bit? I know you don't want to give us the precise numbers, because it can change a bit as you have the full month. But is the backing into kind of a flattish tonnage number about right, what you've seen so far in July? Adam Satterfield : It's down slightly, Tom. And when we look at -- so, it down slightly on a year-over-year basis. Similar to what we've seen in the prior couple of quarters, the first month of the quarter. In the first quarter this year, the second quarter as well, was well below normal seasonal trends. I would say that we're a little bit below our normal seasonality. Typically, July is always a month of decreases, typically decreases about 3%, as compared to June. We are a little bit below that. But, as some of you are looking to from a year-over-year standpoint comparing this year back to 2019, at least what we're seeing is kind of similar -- somewhat similar trend in July versus June looking at it from that perspective as well. So, we'll see how the rest of the third quarter continues to play out. Typically, September is our busiest month of the year. And so, we'll look to see volumes -- if we get some sequential acceleration to get through the remainder of this quarter, but it's just something we'll continue to stay engaged with our customers on and try to continue to manage from a cost standpoint and make sure we've got everyone and everything in place to deal with the volumes that we're seeing. Tom Wadewitz : Great, okay. Great. Thanks, Adam. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess I just wanted to touch on sort of the commentary around the pace of demand and not to be too nitpicky, but I guess I just want to sort of maybe understand, it seems like tonnage is maybe performing a little bit less than typical seasonality. So I guess I'm curious, do you think there is a sort of demand deceleration that's kind of becoming more clear within the numbers? It sounds like customers are still relatively optimistic about what the pace of volume might look like as the year progresses. But is there a bit of a disconnect between what you're hearing from them and what's actually coming through from a tonnage perspective? Adam Satterfield : I don't know that it's -- I mean this is really something we've had to address all year and really trying to bifurcate the demand that we're seeing and hearing from our customers versus the actual tonnage trends. And we have -- like I just mentioned, we have underperformed normal seasonality. But we have to somewhat keep in mind too that our 10-year average trends that includes our market share doubling over that time period. So, we have continued to win market share. I think when you look at our numbers versus the industry, the last two or three quarters, I think if you take the public carriers the tons have been negative overall for that group while you've seen obviously tremendous growth from us. And I still think that based on the feedback and conversations with customers that you'll continue to see our volume numbers outperforming, at least that public group that we compare against. And so, the conversation around demand is the demand for our service. And certainly, our customers they may not have the same type of volumes. So, we're still picking up. We haven't lost any customer accounts. We're still making pickups every day, but it may just be. They don't have the same number of shipments to give us, because some of the demand for their product has decreased. But, I think the positive takeaway from this is how strong we continue to see one the strength of our pricing programs, but just those customer conversations and no customer defections and the conversation about the need for service and how important that is becoming to your customers. We've certainly proven our value proposition over years. And how -- we may be a little bit more expensive upfront, but when you look at the total cost of transportation, whether it's delivering and meeting the on-time and full requirements that some of the retailers have in place, we can ultimately help our customers save money. And so those are the things that continue to drive these positive customer conversations that we're having. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Appreciate that color. That makes sense. And you guys have been through obviously many cycles and so \u2013 and have been pretty successful in navigating through those cycles. You just mentioned the sort of resiliency and the pricing you're able to get in this market even as maybe demand at your customers is beginning to fall a little bit. So if we think about sort of a normal recession whatever that may be in your definition, how do you think sort of operating ratio and maybe earnings power progresses, assuming that maybe the back half or some point in 2023, we're seeing more sustained negative volumes for the industry? Is positive profit something that we can kind of continue to look for from the model? Just kind of curious, how you think about that resiliency in a downturn. Greg Gantt : Chris, I think all of us are going to have to see where this thing goes. I mean I don't think we're in a recession yet, at least I haven't heard that. We'll have to see where it goes. But at the same time you got to remember, we're up against some tremendous numbers from last year and we're still at a very, very decent level of business, where we can turn a pretty good profit I think. I mean we \u2013 I think we've proven that, right? And certainly the second quarter bears that out. But I think we're still in a pretty good spot. Again, we can't control the economy and some of the things that the government does that drive some of it and whatnot. But I think we're still in a good spot today and let's hope we don't see further deterioration in the things going on from an economic standpoint. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. No, that\u2019s very helpful. Certainly, we can see the strength of the numbers we have no doubt about that. Thanks for the comment. Appreciate it. Greg Gantt : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the headcount question. So if I look back at some of the past periods where tonnage has gone negative, headcount usually follows and comes down too. If I just take flat headcount from here in Q3, it's still up about 10%. Do you see opportunities if tonnage stays negative to reduce headcount, or are you going to be potentially more reluctant to do that this time around just given the problems that everybody had hiring people? Greg Gantt : I think maybe you're pretty perceptive of how our industry has been the last couple of years with that question, Scott. No question. I mean we certainly don't want to get in a situation where we have to start making cuts and that kind of thing. That's extremely hard to do. We always hate to do that. I mean obviously, we've got to try to match revenue or the shipment levels to labor. I mean that's what we've done for many, many years and we have to continue to do that. In some cases, attrition helps to take care of our situation. So we always have a little bit of that, probably much less here than most places. But we \u2013 obviously, we're stalling hiring. We're not actively hiring hardly anywhere now maybe specific needs and replacements and that kind of thing but we're certainly not adding anybody on top of what we've got. So yes, I can promise you any reductions we would make we would look at those very, very carefully before we execute it if that makes sense. Scott Group : Okay. But it does sound like if we're not sort of hiring more will there be some sort of natural attrition that could take the headcount down a little bit from here? Greg Gantt : Certainly. Absolutely. Scott Group : Okay. And so maybe just to tie that with that last question. So in an environment, where tonnage stays negative for a little bit, do you think you could still improve the operating ratio or maintain the operating ratio as you've done in like 15 out of 16 years or something like that? Greg Gantt : Well, that would obviously, would be our objective to continue to maintain and certainly improve. I think we've proven it over the course of time and we'll just have to wait and see. I don't want to get into all of that at this point in time. My crystal ball is not completely crystal clear. So we'll just have to see where it goes, but we'll certainly continue to do the right things day-to-day. We'll continue to execute from a service standpoint and what not, keep our people focused on doing the right things and those are the things that drive the bottom line, sometimes the top and the bottom line. But we'll continue to do those things well and we'll see where it goes. Scott Group : Thank you for the time, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Todd Fowler : Hey, great. Thanks and good morning. So Adam in your prepared comments, you had some commentary about cost inflation to the back half of the year. And I'm guessing or I think that traditionally you put through an employee wage increase at some point in the third quarter. And it sounds like you're also getting some benefit from improving productivity from the workforce standpoint. So I guess my question is are your comments that waging that cost inflation on a per shipment basis, is that going to increase or accelerate in the back half of the year, or does that start to level off? I guess, I'm just kind of curious, what your expectations are on the cost inflation side moving forward. Adam Satterfield : Yes. We do always give a wage increase at the beginning of September each year. And so that's pretty standard in terms of, it's in our numbers and it's part of the reason, why the third quarter operating ratio is generally higher, than the second. But from an overall inflation standpoint, when we started the year, we expected higher inflation in the first half. And really, we started seeing cost increasing about this point in time last year. And so our costs are going up, and that's when you can really start seeing -- when we looked at contracts that were turning over in those periods, we had to get larger increases then. So we felt like we were going to see some moderation, with our cost in the back half of this year. But certainly, did perceive the sustained increase in fuel prices and NIM continue to accelerate like they have this year, and that's having a follow-on effect both directly and indirectly with other pieces of our cost structure. So at this point, I don't expect to see that moderation, like we had initially talked about. But don't necessarily see it, accelerating either from this point. I just think that we're going to continue to see, maybe that core inflation number kind of in that 7% to 9% range like we have. And when you back -- if you take our -- look at our costs, and back the operating supplies and expenses out, which includes fuel, they were up about 10% on a in the second quarter, on a per shipment basis. And so it's certainly -- that's higher than where we thought it would be. And -- but we do have some opportunities like Greg mentioned, we certainly want to continue to focus on improving the productivity of all areas of our operation. I think that can help some of that that cost per shipment inflation. We were able to reduce our purchase transportation in the second quarter. There's still a little bit of miles, that we were outsourcing in the second quarter. So we're back in that 2% to 2.5% range number, with that line item, but there may be a little bit more out of that number where we can see some decreases. But otherwise, it's just trying to manage each and every line item on the income statement that we can and look for areas, with discretionary spending that we can pull back on and just look for any area that we can ultimately save some dollars. Todd Fowler : Perfect. Okay, good. That's helpful, and that makes a lot of sense. I guess just to follow up, and it's a little bit of a tricky question to ask, but from a bigger picture standpoint, it sounds like a lot of your competitors their approach to the LTL market now is a lot more like your approach adding some more terminals, focusing more on service. I guess, as you think about the competitive landscape, does that change your ability to win share in the marketplace going forward, or have you seen any differences in customer responses, due to some of the things that your competitors have been doing over the last, let's call it four to six quarters? Greg Gantt : I don't think so, Todd. I mean, we'll continue to execute and do the things that we know best, how to do. I think we've had a pretty steady run up, on our share and I would expect that to continue. Todd Fowler : Yes. That makes sense. I know it\u2019s a tricky question to ask but was just curious about time itself. Thanks for the time this morning. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good morning. Greg and Adam, congrats on breaking 70% a tremendous group leadership there. Just a few -- I guess, you had a few questions on the downturn or potential impacts on the operating ratio. But maybe just, if July is starting to see larger negative tonnage trends versus June and maybe a little bit more than seasonality. Can you talk about a normal cycle? How does that bleed into pricing pressure? I know you don't typically change your pricing, given the quality of service but for the group, how long does it take to see those negative trends kick in and start showing up on the pricing side especially, given what's happened with the truckload side? Adam Satterfield : Yes. Again, I think that when you look at the rest of the group excluding us, I think overall, there's been at least the past three quarters or so where volumes have been negative and -- or at least flat and going back to last year. And so it's -- the environment has continued to -- the pricing environment that is, has continued to remain positive and we haven't heard anything any different really in that regard. So, I think that we know what our strategies are and what we're going to continue to do, a big piece of our yield management strategy is making sure that we're trying to cover the cost inflation we see in our business, but an even bigger element is making sure that we're generating the returns, that will help us continue to invest dollars in the real estate network. And I think when you look over the last 10 years, we've invested about $2 billion in expanding the capacity of our network and when you look at the expansion of our door capacity is about a little over 50% over that 10-year timeframe and at least the number of service centers in the industry is actually down a few percent.  So regardless, if you see some additions here and there, we have been adding really at our customers' requests and our customers are leveraging our network especially in the retail side, some of this e-commerce freight comes and transitions from the truckload world into LTL, that's the power of our network. It helps our customers with managing their supply chains. And ultimately, we think helping them save money overall. So that's why we've got to continue to work at it, but it's still an environment where we've got positive revenue growth.  And our revenue growth of 18% includes that slight decrease in July for tons that we're seeing, but we're still producing revenue growth that's above our long-term average revenue growth rate when you look over the last 10 years. And so, we're just going to continue to look at leveraging that to the bottom line. And certainly, kind of what we talked about with the operating ratio, moving into the third quarter that would still produce some pretty good improvement there on the next quarter's a lot. Ken Hoexter : Adam, just to clarify that. You talked about the last couple of quarters seeing the industry in the past has -- have you seen a more immediate impact to industry pricing or even your pricing in a down tonnage environment, or does it take about three quarters or whatever to start seeing some pressure on? I'm just trying to see if this time really is different because of the industry moves or if this is more historically normal on a delayed pricing impact? Adam Satterfield : Well, I think if you look back 2019 is a good example where the environment was softer. And I think the industry was pretty disciplined with pricing during that period. So, we certainly expect that our own pricing will continue to be positive. And again, we haven't really heard anything from any other carriers. We'll continue to see maybe what they're saying publicly as well. But I think it takes a lot to run an LTL company. Certainly, there's a network effect that has to be managed there. And that's the big difference between us and the truckload environment. I think that it seems to us from what we've heard that, there's not many LTL carriers at least the public ones that have taken on a lot of truckload spillover freight. So, I don't think you're going to see this vacuum effect as truckload has loosened a little bit of freight spilling back into that mode like, we may have seen in prior cycles as well either. So, to me that would lend itself to seeing a little bit more stability maybe with volumes even though like I mentioned they're down for the other carriers or have been for the last few quarters. We'll continue to watch that. But I think we would expect to see the continuation of a disciplined approach much like we did in 2019. Ken Hoexter : And can I just get a clarification on one of the prior questions on -- you talked about stalling hiring now. If we see, I guess those volumes staying at these levels is that something you then expect the attrition to overtake your hiring? And so, you expect that to come in? I just wanted to clarify kind of your comments on the employee levels? Adam Satterfield : Well hiring practices that's something that each one of our 255 service center managers are responsible for. They have to stay engaged with their customers at the local level to know what freight demand within their facility is going to look like to then make sure that they've got the right people capacity in place to be able to respond and give the service that our customers demand from us.  So that's something that we let them manage. It's not just the number of people they have in place. There's always managing the hours worked up and down based on changes with the volumes as well. So, we just got to continue to watch overall how the volumes trend and we feel good about our numbers right now and we feel good about our overall level of headcount as well. But ultimately, we'll continue to let our service centers manage that and individually maybe see seeing some that are making additions because they're growing and we're seeing in some facilities really strong double-digit outbound type of revenue and volume growth. And then the others, if they've got some weakness in their facility for whatever reason specific customer type of issues they -- they've got to manage on the other side. But it's a coordinated effort that's really -- we give that responsibility with oversight obviously. But our service center managers are handling that on a day-to-day basis. Ken Hoexter : Wonderful. Thanks very much, Adam, Greg. Appreciate the time. Operator : The next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Amit Mehrotra : Hey, thanks. I'll try to just ask one question to balance out the three questions that some other people asked. I think three or four years ago, Greg and Adam you kind of started the call mentioning, some deteriorating pricing power in the industry. And on follow-up you kind of talked about just bringing attention to some indiscipline that you're seeing in certain lanes. I think part of the motivation was to kind of nip it in the bud early. It seems like we're kind of at that part of the cycle where we could start to see that a little bit. I'd love for you guys to comment on that. Are you seeing any players any large national players, because of weaker service levels or whatever that may be seeing a little bit more deterioration and demand start to be a little bit more indisciplined on pricing? If you can comment on that. Greg Gantt : No. We have not seen that at all. Certainly not to my knowledge I haven't heard that. Like Adam had mentioned earlier, we've had an awful lot of customer interaction so far this year with customers coming here, some of the things we're doing out in the field from a customer standpoint, we have not seen that have not gotten that type of feedback from our sales department. So I think that's all positive. And I think if you look at our LTL industry, we're all healthier than we've been for the most part. I think the bottom lines have improved across the board. I think I can say that without putting a whole lot of thought into it, but I think everybody has to see the benefit of being price disciplined surely. So I think it's benefited the industry in general. So, yes, let's hope that continues. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. That's my one. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Bruce Chan : Great. Thanks for the time here. Greg, I just want to follow-up on those pricing comments really quick. We've heard from a few others out there that there's been a little bit of a pickup in inbound RFPs and RFQs maybe especially from the larger national account side. Are you all seeing any signs of that? Greg Gantt : I don't think so. I haven't heard that. I mean, most of our bigger national accounts they're all -- we have annual renewals and whatnot. Some may be on two or three-year type renewals. But -- most everybody that's on annual renewal I haven't heard that there's any huge pickup with that at all. So, no at this point not, but we'll see certainly have to wait and see, but so far so good from our standpoint. Bruce Chan : Okay. Great. Appreciate the time. Operator : The next question comes from Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Ari Rosa : Hey, good morning. Greg, Adam. Thanks for squeezing me in here. So you guys talked about investing in the network to take share through the cycle or preparing for the next cycle. And it's certainly a formula that's worked very well for OD in the past. I wanted to get your sense for kind of how you're thinking about that in terms of the longevity of what a down cycle might look like, and kind of the risk that you might be sitting on idle capacity for an extended period of time, if demand deteriorates. And it seems like there's kind of two different schools of thought. On one level, it seems like the LTL industry has been pretty tight on capacity and pretty disciplined about the way it's invested. And maybe that means there hasn't been as much froth that's developed on the supply side. At the same time, obviously, what we've seen in terms of consumer spending and durable goods orders has been pretty anomalous over the last kind of 18 to 24 months given COVID, and maybe there's some concern that that those conditions that have existed over the past 18 months or so aren't really sustainable from a demand perspective. So I just wanted to kind of hear your thoughts on, as you invest to expand the service center footprint, how do you perceive the risk that you might be sitting on idle capacity for maybe a longer period of time than you might hope for? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I think we're always sitting on idle capacity and that's really what we want to have in place. And we generally target having 20% to 25% excess capacity at all times. And the reason for that is as quickly as demand can change, you can't put service center capacity in place quick enough. And it takes doors in an LTL network to really process freight and be able to grow. Certainly, you got to have equipment and people as well, but the doors are really what takes the most time to get in place. And it's why when we see these positive inflections in the domestic economy that you see the rate of market share growth for us increased significantly where we're outperforming the rest of the group by double digits if you will. And so it's -- you've got to put in place, you got to have a consistent investment process and just continuing to work at it knowing where things are tighter and where you might be tight in a couple of years' time if volume comes back to you in a big way. So we're used to carrying that extra cost, but that's part of our strategy and it is different. We like to keep that excess capacity in place. Most of the industry it seems operates closer to full utilization within the network and -- but that creates a lot of volume opportunities like we saw in 2020 in the back half as the recovery began and certainly through 2021 with the rate of growth that we had then and so far through the first half of this year. And again, as we said earlier, we've produced over $700 million of revenue growth. So last year was a record at $1.2 billion for us and we're on a good pace to have another $1 billion plus type of revenue growth year, but it certainly takes making those investments. And when you look and trying to go back into some of these prior years when there has been a down cycle. You can look at our operating ratio in 2016-2019 we're able to manage all of our variable costs well and try to take advantage of productivity opportunities. But generally the only change in the operating ratio you might see is with respect to that depreciation line item and that's where we are making those investments those depreciation cost will increase as a percent of revenue. But we try to manage all of the other costs flat or with some improvement if we can to minimize any type of negative impact on the operating ratio until we get that volume flow coming through again. And we've said it takes density and yields to produce long-term margin improvement and that will continue into the future as well. But certainly need to get that density factor it takes a continuous investment in capacity. Ari Rosa : Got it. Understood. Okay. Thank you for the time. Operator : The next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Bascome Majors : Adam in the last six months you guys have bought considerably more stock than you bought in any prior full year. Can you talk a little bit about the pace you feel comfortable with in the second half? And will you consider adding a little leverage to take advantage of the share price, or historically you've been -- within your free cash flow as far as total shareholder returns is that a good kind of bookend to think about as we think about where share repurchase can go? Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Well, certainly the repurchase program we typically look at our cash from operations. And at the beginning of every year we know what our CapEx is going to be. And then we've got the fixed return element through the dividend program and then we typically take the balance and try to put that into the share repurchase program. But we have said in prior periods when we think the opportunity is right, we'll put more dollars into that program. And certainly that's how we have felt this year. In the first quarter, we did have a $400 million accelerated share repurchase program. In the second quarter it was more strategic and just day-to-day buying on a more of a 10b-5 type of basis. And we'll continue to look at all options as we move forward. But certainly, when the share price is at the level where it's been, it's certainly down from where we finished last year and we're going to continue to buy more shares and use the cash that's on the balance sheet for starters and you just got to continue to look at it on a day-to-day basis. We've -- in the past we've said we don't necessarily want to directly borrow to go out to buy stock. But we've always just got to look at kind of where the price is trending and what we think the best use of cash is and then just trying to take a longer-term view of it as well. Bascome Majors : Great. So it sounds like leverage to buy stock is not plan A but opportunism can make that possible depending on your view of the market versus your stock price? Adam Satterfield : Correct. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from James Monigan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. James Monigan : Hey, guys. Thank you. Just wanted to actually touch on -- or follow-up on something you had mentioned around the spread between pricing cost and just the pricing environment overall. I just wanted to sort of get your sense on sort of the amount of cost pressure maybe some of your competitors are under and if you think that might keep discipline fairly high around pricing? And also just maybe sort of thinking about like the outlook for that spread moving forward just given the fact that you guys own more of your assets and therefore might have a cost advantage? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I don't know that we can comment on our competitors' cost structures, but certainly for us we obviously feel like we've got opportunity to continue to one to try to reduce some of our costs through productivity. But that's again, kind of, going back to our continuous improvement cycle and then trying to price above cost. And it's not always on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Again, it's not always going to be that we've got that 100 basis point to 150 basis point delta in our revenue per shipment and cost per shipment performance, and you've got to look at that on a more of a core basis. But we just look at it over a longer-term time horizon. But that's the yield improvements, one big element for the long-term margin improvement opportunities that we think we have. And I mean obviously a lot goes into that. It's easy to sit here and say that we need yield above cost, but a lot go into both of those metrics. And certainly you got to have a service to support the yield. And then we've got to continue to look at ways that we can save on the cost side as well to make sure that our price deal in alignment with the market. And we do believe we can get a price premium in the market based on the quality of our service and we study our Mastio Quality results closely each year to look at how we compare against ourselves and how we compare against the rest of the industry to make sure that we're staying on top of changes. We're staying ahead of the market. We're continuing to give our customers what they are asking for as well, be it through capacity in markets, be it capacity of our trailer pool, technologies, pricing programs, and new changes there. You name it, we're always trying to stay ahead of the curve and we feel confident that we've got a lot of market share opportunities in front of us and we just want to keep our focus on execution to make sure we take advantage of those opportunities and again make sure that it's not just growth it's good profitable growth. James Monigan : Got it. Just given how much cost run up do you think that there's a repricing opportunity or a need to reprice moving forward on a larger portion of your business than normal? Adam Satterfield : No. And again that's part of our continuous improvement cycle. Our contracts in our business come up every day. It's why you generally see on a sequential basis improvements in our yield metrics as we go from quarter-to-quarter. So, as a contract comes up for renewal, we're going to ask for an increase. And to improve the yield on an account, it's not always through a price increase either. It's looking at other areas of opportunity in ways that we can help a customer save money and that may be an operational change. It could be a number of things and that's why it's so important for our sales team to stay engaged with the customers to understand what their needs are. Our pricing team as well, so that we can work together and create win-win situations because we're not here to just have a customer for this quarter and the next quarter. We've got customers that have been in place for many, many years. And any new customer that's coming on board, we want them to be in place for the long-term as well. So, it's all about creating those win-win situations. And whether it's again through an operational change, we've recently announced a new pricing program as well that we've got some engagement on and some excitement that can eliminate the need to have payment all the services for customers. And so those are the ways that we're going to continue to stay engaged with our customer base and try to do right things right by them and keep improving our sales both the top and the bottom-lines. James Monigan : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg Gantt for any closing remarks. Greg Gantt : Well, thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks and I hope you have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Drew Anderson. Please go ahead. Drew Andersen : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the third quarter 2022 Conference Call for Old Dominion Freight Line.

As a final note, before we begin, we welcome your questions today, but we ask in fairness to all that you limit yourselves to just a couple of questions at a time before returning to the queue. Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir. Greg Gantt : Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. During the third quarter, the Old Dominion team extended the company's track record for double-digit growth in revenue and profitability. The third quarter of 2022 was our seventh straight quarter with double-digit revenue growth and the nice straight quarter of double-digit growth in earnings per diluted share. These financial results reflect the ongoing strength and demand for our services as we continue to deliver value to our customers by providing superior service at a fair price. Consistently executing on this key element of our long-term strategic plan is critical to our continued ability to win long-term market share. We were pleased to provide our customers with 99% on-time service and a cargo claims ratio of 0.2% during the third quarter. Service means much more than just picking up and delivering our customers' freight on time and damage free. In fact, MASTIO & Company conducts a comprehensive industry study each year that most recently measured carriers on 28 service and value-related attributes. We are extremely proud that MASTIO recently named OD as the #1 LTL provider for the 13th straight year. And this latest survey, shippers and logistics professionals ranked OD as #1 for 24 of the 28 individual attributes. The consistency of our service performance over many years, as validated by MASTIO reflects the commitment from each of our team members who work hard every day to go above and beyond for our customers. Our superior service performance has not only allowed us to win market share over the long term. It has also supported our long-term yield management strategy. This simple strategy focuses on increasing our yields to offset our cost inflation each year while also supporting our ongoing investments in capacity. We have consistently invested 10% to 15% of our revenue in capital expenditures each year regardless of the economic environment. Investments in our fleet and technologies have helped us improve our operating efficiency and customer service, while the significant investments in our service center network generally support our growth. We have expanded the capacity of our service center network by over 50% in the past 10 years while doubling our market share, and we believe further investments will be necessary to ensure that our network is never a limiting factor to our growth. We believe a big part of our value proposition is having available capacities when our customers need it the most. The capacity advantage we have in the marketplace was especially critical for customers that dealt with various supply chain issues over the past 2 years, while industry capacity was generally limited. We increased our revenues by over $2 billion over the past 2 years, which would not have been possible if we had not consistently increased our network capacity. Our business model continues to prove itself time and again, and we are extremely grateful to our customers for their trust in us. Freight is a relationship business, and we believe our superior service, available network capacity and consistent approach to pricing have allowed us to strengthen our long-term relationships. We also believe the value offered by a carrier is becoming increasingly important to shippers, which is why we remain absolutely committed to executing on the fundamental elements of our long-term strategic plan. As a result, we will continue to focus on providing customers with superior service at a fair price. We will also continue to invest in our OD Family of employees, our fleet and our service center network to support our long-term growth initiatives. Old Dominion has the financial strength to make these investments, and as a result, we believe we are better positioned than any carrier to produce long-term profitable growth and increase shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue grew 14.5% in the third quarter to $1.6 billion, and our operating ratio improved to 69.1%. The combination of these changes helped produce a 36% increase in earnings per diluted share for the quarter. Our revenue growth was due primarily to the 17.4% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight, which more than offset the 2.6% decrease in our LTL tons. We believe this decrease in LTL tons reflects the overall softness in the domestic economy that has generally caused a decrease in demand for our customers' products. Demand for our service has remained strong, however, as customers are continuing to take advantage of our value proposition. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the third quarter decreased 3.8% when compared to the second quarter of 2022, with LTL tons per day decreasing 4.3% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 3.6%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes an increase of 3.6% in revenue per day, an increase of 1.2% in tons per day and an increase of 2.4% in shipments per day. At this point, in October, our revenue per day has increased by approximately 8% when compared to October 2021. This month-to-date revenue performance includes a decrease of approximately 7% in our LTL tons per day. As usual, we will provide actual revenue related details for October in our third quarter Form 10-Q. Our third quarter operating ratio improved to 69.1% with improvements in both our direct operating cost and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Many of our cost categories improved as a percent of revenue during the quarter, although our operating supplies and expenses increased 300 basis points due primarily to the rising cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products as well as the increased cost for parts and repairs to maintain our fleet. We more than offset the impact of this increase with the improvement in our salaries, wages and benefits and purchase transportation. The improvement in these expenses as a percent of revenue reflects our best efforts to effectively match all of our variable costs with current revenue and volume trends. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $514.2 million and $1.3 billion for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2022, respectively, while capital expenditures were $181.7 million and $504.8 million for the same periods. We noted in our release this morning that our capital expenditures are now estimated to be $720 million for this year. The decrease from our prior estimate is primarily due to the timing of equipment deliveries that we expect to be pushed into next year. We will provide further details about our 2023 capital expenditure plan with our fourth quarter earnings release. We utilized $345.4 million and $1.1 billion of cash for our share repurchase program during the third quarter and first 9 months of 2022, respectively, while cash dividends totaled $33.4 million and $101.4 million for the same periods. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter 2022 was 23.9% as compared to 25.2% in the third quarter 2021. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25.6% for the fourth quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question today comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins : Okay, great. So I guess, first, Adam, I'd be curious if you could maybe give us the full stats for September in terms of tonnage per day on a year-over-year basis. And was there anything sort of unique kind of going on in September with regard to the end of the quarter with the hurricane? And I guess just kind of wrapping up that September, October commentary, I guess, do you feel like that the sequential trends are the underperformance versus seasonality is maybe accelerating somewhat. And if you can maybe provide some color on sort of what's driving that. So anyway, I know a lot there, but just sort of curious on current trends and if you could provide some additional color there. Adam Satterfield : Sure. We'll test my memory, I guess, and see if I can remember all of those. But so for September, looking at on a year-over-year basis, our tonnage was down 5.4% and then shipments, those were, let's see here, shipments per day were down 6.8%. So we had a little bit of an increase in weight per shipment for the month. It was up about 1.5% overall. And so if you remember, we've talked before about the weight per shipment trend last year, the third quarter was our low watermark, if you will, where we were at a total of 1,538 pounds. So we did start seeing a sequential increase from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of last year. So that should somewhat normalize as we transition. Looking at things on a sequential basis for the tonnage, we did have in September about a 0.4% increase versus August. The 10-year average is a 3.9% increase. So similar, I think what we saw in the third quarter is similar to the second quarter. We did underperform for the total quarter, the average sequential trends in 2Q. And we did, again, this is the third straight quarter of underperformance, if you will, but we started out with the decrease in July, which is pretty typical. We were down 4%. The 10-year average is down 3%. And then we dropped a little bit further in August, which is normally about flattish. And then we just didn't see the sizable increase that we typically do in September. I will say that so far and obviously, there are still days to be finished for October, but we look like we are trending pretty much right in line with normal seasonality at this point, which I think is an encouraging trend. Certainly, a lot of work left to do as we go through the fourth quarter. Typically, we would see an increase in November and then it drops off in December. Normally, overall, you've got a decrease on average for the fourth quarter versus the third. Last year, we did have an increase, which makes the comps quite a bit tougher in the fourth quarter. And we anticipated that really is going into the beginning of this year, really. So I think it's just one of those things, like we said in our prepared remarks that certainly feels like demand for us. The feedback that we're getting from our customers has been positive. We're seeing good trends with our national account reporting. We're not losing customers. So things are all trending favorably in that regard. It's just a matter of the demand, we feel like is not out there for our customers' products, if you will. We're just not picking up as much freight for those same customers that we may be making stops every day at their locations. So just continuing to kind of work through these challenges, if you will. We certainly made adjustments all year. I think when you look at the operating ratio performance in general and what our service metrics are, we've been making adjustments to this lower-than-anticipated volume environment that we've been in. But we typically, when we've been in a down cycle, we've been in a negative GDP environment this year. A lot of times, we'll see 3 to 5 quarters where we kind of underperform our 10-year average. I always like to remind everyone that our 10-year average includes doubling their market share. But this, like I said, was the third quarter where we underperformed. We're going into the winter. That's always a little bit seasonally slower anyways. And so we feel like based on what we've been able to do so far this year producing over $900 million of revenue growth, good solid operating ratio improvement. We'll get through this winter and then perhaps we start seeing some build up once we get into the spring and I'm talking on a sequential basis, start seeing that build up back in the business once we get into the spring. Maybe sooner, obviously, a lot's going on with the economy. But that's some of the baseline for what we're thinking right now. Jack Atkins : Okay. That's very helpful color, Adam. And you got all my all those different questions in there. I guess maybe for my one quick follow-up. Would just be curious to kind of get your sense for sequential, how we should be thinking about the sequential change in operating ratio 3Q to 4Q? I know to your point, typically, tonnage is a bit softer sequentially. And there's -- I'm sure a lot of puts and takes out there. Historically, it's about 200 basis point degradation 3Q to 4Q. Is that the right way to think about it this year? Or just some additional color would be helpful. Adam Satterfield : Sure. Yes, for one, the fourth quarter, we usually have an annual actuarial assessment that can impact, if you just look at the raw numbers, the pure average. But it's usually about a 200 to 250 basis point sequential deterioration from 3Q to 4Q. And I think probably the appropriate target would be about a 400 basis points increase off of 69.1 that we had. And just talking through a few of those puts and takes that will go into it. And I'd say 400, probably plus or minus a little bit, just depending on -- in some cases, some of these expense items I'm about to talk about, but also the top line. But obviously, we've got -- we had a onetime item that favorably impacted our operating ratio by about 100 basis points in the third quarter. So kind of adding that back to normalized what our fringe benefit cost have been trending earlier this year. Then I think that similar to the 2Q to 3Q change in our general supplies and expenses, we generally see a little bit of improvement from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. I expect that from a dollar standpoint, that should remain somewhat flattish, but as revenue is typically a little bit lower, we'd expect that to increase. Maybe 20 basis points from 3Q to 4Q. Depreciation is another item. We're still taking delivery of equipment. Normally, you kind of have all your depreciation in there, so I'd expect to see that continue, tick up a little bit. And then finally, our miscellaneous expenses, those have trended low throughout the year. Those are typically around about 0.5 point. I think we're at 20 basis points, 0.2% in the third quarter. So I expect that to normalize at some point as well. So some of those cost items just may create just a little bit of variance versus what the 10-year average might otherwise suggest. But you know us, I mean, we're looking at every dollar we can from a discretionary spending standpoint and we'll be managing productivity and other costs as tightly as we can as we continue to adjust to current top line revenue and volume trends. Operator : The next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. James Monigan : James on for Allison. Actually, I just wanted to get a little bit more color on September and just kind of wanted to understand if there was a mix shift in the in that month that might have impacted yields and trying to sort of get a sense of what pricing was independent of sort of that mix shift change and sort of how we should think about that moving forward? Adam Satterfield : Yes, nothing major that we have not already been seeing certainly that our weight per shipment has been trending higher, as I mentioned, at least through the third quarter. And then our length of haul has been a bit lower as well. That's down almost 1%. So both of those metrics putting a little downward pressure on that reported revenue per hundredweight metric. And which I think we've talked a little bit about that on the last earnings call. Overall, excluding the fuel surcharge, the revenue per hundredweight was up 7%. So we're still seeing good yield performance overall. And then those yields are mix metrics, if you will, somewhat reconcile how we got from the growth rate that we are seeing for the second quarter to the third quarter. But overall, as contracts are renewing, we're continuing to look for increases and design with our long-term philosophy is we always are looking to try to increase yields to offset our cost inflation. I would say, core inflation is probably a bit higher than what some of these increases we're getting right now just dealing with this inflationary environment. But we're always looking at things on a long-term basis. And so we're continuing to make progress on those renewals, try to get our cost-plus type pricing to ultimately support the investments that we're making back in the system. We've invested a lot in real estate capital expenditures. When you look over the last 10 years, it's been almost $4 billion of investment in total with about $2 billion going into our real estate network. So I think we've certainly done a good job of making sure we're investing ahead of growth, and we don't want the network to be a limiting factor to our ability to grow. And so it's been important to build in that capacity into the service center network, and it certainly makes years like 2021 and the growth that we've seen in revenue this year possible. James Monigan : Got it. And just a follow-up on that, just given the renewals that you're seeing, the sort of efficiency in the network, like if tonnage trends continue negatively or even sort of become more negative, do you just -- is 2023 a year that you can still get OR expansion sort of at or above 100 basis points? Or are you going to start bumping up against fixed costs fairly soon? Adam Satterfield : Well, I think the thing that we typically see in the past, and you can look at sort of 2016, 2019, as an example, is when we get into an environment where revenue is flat to down overall, that's something where we are going to continue to invest, like Greg mentioned in his comments earlier, we're going to continue to invest for the long term. And so that often creates a little headwind, if you will, on the depreciation cost as a percent of revenue. But the OR change that we saw in '16 and '19, the slight deterioration in those periods was pretty much limited to that change in depreciation cost as a percent of revenue. We certainly are looking to manage all of our variable costs to match what those revenue volume trends are. We'll be looking for productivity. And we'll be looking closely at every dollar that we spend. We certainly want to spend dollars when there's an appropriate return that's there and don't want to do anything that it might limit our long-term performance. But you just got to be careful when it comes to discretionary spending. So we've generally been able to manage all those other costs flat. Our cost structure is highly variable, more than 2/3, almost 3/4 of our cost over now. So we just continue to work those costs as best we can. Look for productivity in any way that we can save money to offset any kind of pressure we may be seeing on the top line. Operator : The next question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Jordan Alliger : Just a follow-up maybe on the cost front, looking ahead beyond even the current quarter, you talked about inflation. Is there any relief on the inflation front, whether it be on the wage side. I assume on the purchased transport side, but just sort of your thoughts on sort of the cost inflation environment as we move beyond this? What you're seeing today? Adam Satterfield : Well, from a core inflation standpoint, as we go into next year, I think everybody in this country is probably hoping for seeing some type of relief. And really, I think that starts with we've got to have improvement on the energy side. Energy drives inflation overall for this country, and we've got to see some type of movement there. And I think that gives -- kind of removes the hurdle of uncertainty for many business owners and our customers because then it should control what the Fed action may be. And so once you get those, then I think at least cleared, you get reinvestment back in businesses and so forth and hopefully start seeing freight flows once again a little bit stronger at the levels that we anticipated when we started this year. But for us, in particular, salary wages and benefits are probably 65% of our total cost. And we did just give a wage increase at the 1st of September this year, rewarding our employees for the performance that they've been able to produce over this last year. And so we control that element of inflation. Certainly, on the benefit side, we've seen a little bit higher cost later on some of the medical costs in particular. But as we continue to improve pay time off benefits and some of those other features that we've rewarded employees with. Another 15% of our costs there are the operating supplies and expenses. Fuel is obviously a big component. I think our surcharge program has been effective at offsetting the increase there, and we hope that we'll see a decrease as we make our way through 2023. And that should help on some of the parts and other component tires and so forth that we've taken big increases on this year. And then certainly, on the depreciation side, with respect to equipment, we've taken some increases there. We hope some of those moderate as we get into next year as well. We haven't finalized what our equipment orders and what pricing and so forth will look like. But those are some of the biggest elements. We certainly have faced increased insurance premiums like every other carrier over the past several years and again, it's just you got to keep looking for ways that when you know you got an increase in one area. So you've got to try to find some savings in the other. And the biggest area for us will be to continue to focus on improved productivity with salaries, wages and benefits being our biggest cost element, we can offset. We control the inflation, but we can help ourselves by continuing to drive improved performance in those areas. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Adam, I wanted to just follow up. I thought I heard you say that core inflation is now tracking above some of the recent pricing increases you're getting. That feels like a pretty big change just for third quarter rent per shipment ex fuel is up 9%. So just add a little bit of color or clarity to what you're saying there. Adam Satterfield : Well, just mainly talking about what we've seen in terms of cost on a per shipment basis. And sometimes those per shipment costs increase a little bit more when you're in a little bit softer environment overall. I mean we've still got a positive spread in terms of when you look at revenue per shipment performance versus its cost per shipment. And we certainly think that can continue overall. And that's -- the focus is always to try to achieve 100 to 150 basis points of positive spread overall and what we can get on a revenue per shipment basis with the fuel versus what the cost per shipment with the fuel can be as well. But just looking at things on a pure cost per shipment basis is certainly trending a lot higher than what I had thought. I thought we would see moderation in the back half of this year, as we started comping against some of the increased inflationary items that we experienced in the second half of '21, but certainly, that moderation hasn't happened. So we're still seeing some pretty big increases, and I think a lot of it is driven by these increased fuel prices that have just remained high throughout the year. We thought we were going to start seeing some relief a few weeks ago on that as it started trending down a little bit the last 2, 3 weeks. I think it's back up about $0.50 over where we had dropped to a bit prior. But no, no change in terms of of what we're going to be looking for from an increased standpoint and what we think we can achieve because again, we've got to have cost plus pricing in our business that offset that inflation, but more importantly, to keep supporting the reinvestment back in our business. Scott Group : So you weren't trying to imply that pricing is all of a sudden slowing a lot or anything like that. Adam Satterfield : No, not at all. And if I said that, I misspoke for sure. Now we're really pleased, I think when you look at in terms of the yield trends that we've had all year. They certainly have been very positive, and that's continuing into October. And we didn't -- I gave the number in terms of what we're seeing from a -- at least as of right now, what the tonnage is doing. But certainly, that implies that, that revenue per hundredweight, excluding the fuel is pretty consistent with where we were, maybe a touch higher for the third quarter overall. And so we would certainly expect that as we continue to go through renewals, generally, mix has held comps in that number increases sequentially from quarter-to-quarter. And certainly, that will be the objective as we have increases coming due, and we'll be coming up fairly soon on the general rate increase as well. They will apply to about 25% of our business. But all of those factors, we've not really seen any change in the pricing environment. It's remained steady throughout this year. And certainly, this quarter the increases we've been able to get. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Christian Wetherbee : Adam, I just wanted to make sure I understood the sequential cadence in operating ratio from 3Q to 4Q. I think you said it was maybe 400 basis points plus or minus relative to the 69.1%. I just want to make sure that, that is right. And then as you think about sort of the potential variables that maybe you could add to that. I guess that would kind of get you closer to OR -- flattish OR on a year-over-year basis, I think you're still below it based on the guidance. But I wanted to get a sense of conceptually as we start to string out over the next few quarters, what are some of the dynamics that could then start to potentially push a deterioration in the operating ratio? Adam Satterfield : Well, I mean, obviously, the top line is the biggest element. Certainly, when you've got revenue, that covers a lot of cost and some of those fixed cost elements that we have. But you have the 400 basis point, plus or minus, that was off the 69.1 reported operating ratio. And obviously, just the delta versus the normal cadence, the biggest being that 100 basis point benefit that was onetime in nature that was recorded in the third quarter. But yes, we certainly transition into the next year. Typically, the first quarter is about 100 basis points worse than the fourth quarter. In the first quarter of '22, we had a 70 basis point improvement. So we know we've got some tougher comparisons coming up from both a top line standpoint and an operating ratio standpoint, just given the phenomenal performance that we've had this year. And it's almost 300 basis points improvement in the operating ratio from a year-to-date standpoint. So it's been an incredibly strong year coming off of the improvement that we made in 2021. I mean the -- had $1.2 billion of revenue growth in, and we put another $900 million year-to-date on top of that. So in a probably a negative GDP environment. So I think we're probably in a stronger position than we've ever been in terms of going through a slower macro environment with respect to the relationships that we had with our customers. We mentioned earlier, we've not lost any business that we've got to try to go back and regain, if you will. It's just going to be a function of when our customers have more freight to be able to give to us. And so that's encouraging. I've mentioned that I feel like the October trend is encouraging as well. So just be a function of getting through kind of this winter and seeing where that baseline becomes where we finished the fourth quarter of this year from a volume standpoint and then getting through 1Q. And like I mentioned, seeing if we can't start getting some of that seasonal buildup that we would typically see coming to us early next year. But again, a lot of it in terms of an OR standpoint is it becomes more challenging to get year-over-year improvements in a flattish or a down revenue environment. But like I mentioned before, for us, it's -- we're going to manage all of our variable costs and then just sort of keep investing. So we might see some loss there on the depreciation line, but that's something that we know once that volume returns to the business. And we say to produce long-term operating ratio improvement takes improvements in density and yield. So once it starts coming back to us, we've proven what we can do in terms of the model. And so getting that throughput through the system, I think we can start working and trying to achieve the long-term operating ratio goal that we laid out at the end of last year of producing a sub-70 annual operating ratio. Christian Wetherbee : Yes. Okay. That makes sense. And then you guys have done historically a good job of outperforming on a tonnage basis relative to peers, both I think in up cycles as well as down cycles. I guess as you think about this one, maybe with -- maybe more of your competitors leaning in from a growth perspective. I don't know if you would agree with that comment first off. But how do you sort of see that relative performance opportunity for you as you go through what could be a softer period over the course of the next year or so? Adam Satterfield : Well, a lot of times, our market share has been flatter, if you will, like, again, looking at 2016 and 2019, as recent examples. But for the last 3 quarters, while we've been still producing really solid volume growth, if you back us out at least from the public carrier group, volumes have been negative on a year-over-year basis going back to 4Q of last year. And really just looking at total tonnage, it's kind of on an average basis was flattish pretty much since the first quarter of '21 through second quarter of '22. So we've certainly significantly increased our market share when you look at the volumes and the revenue trends for us through these last couple of years. But a lot of times, like I said, it's just -- it may be a point where we may get to where we're sort of flattish, if you will, with the group. But right now, it just -- it feels a little bit different. And that's what I mean by we've not lost when I look at our national account reporting talking to customers. There's more conversations about the value add that -- how we help customer supply chains really over these last couple of years as people have dealt with the pandemic and supply chain challenges. And what we were able to do in '21, in particular, while there were a lot of capacity issues within the industry and to be able to support our customers and their growth and try to keep their networks and supply chain balanced. I think that's gone a long way. We've proven our value proposition. And so that's why I think we're in a better spot than perhaps we've ever been. So whenever we come out of this slower economic environment to really start building on the market share levels that we currently have in place. So yes, that's kind of what we've seen in the past and certainly where we think we might be, but where we've been flattish, we might still see a little positive delta from a share standpoint through the group. Certainly, we've been in probably 3 straight quarters of negative GDP. And when you compare our volume performance versus the other public carriers at least, there's probably been a wider spread there perhaps in other times in the past. Operator : The next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Adam, I don't know if you mentioned this before, but you talked about October being a little bit better. Can you just quantify that for us? Like typically, obviously, what's the historical shipment volume or tonnage role from October, September to October versus what it was? And then less of a nitpicky question. I guess I'm not so worried about Old Dominion's ability to see a positive spread between revenue and cost per shipment. I think you've done it 10 in the last 15 years because obviously, the MASTIO data and the service and you guys are just best in class there. But I guess the question really is the industry's ability to see positive yield ex-fuel growth next year. And some of this is a pricing discipline question for the industry, which I ask every quarter, but I just want to get your perspective in terms of what you think the industry's ability to see yield ex-fuel positive pricing is next year based on everything you're seeing out there from a pricing perspective? Adam Satterfield : Sure. Yes. One, thank you for recognizing the service performance. And certainly, as we said, service supports yield. You can't go into an account at a renewal. You've had service failures and so forth and have had rolling embargoes and missed pickups, late deliveries, damage shipments, those types of things and to be able to get the consistent increases like we've been able to achieve really going back for many years now. But that is a differentiated quality from us versus the group as well as I think that we look for consistency with our program is not necessarily whose favor is the market today versus tomorrow. We just want to build in a fair approach that tries to create win-win scenarios for us and for our customers. They know what the -- how to forecast and plan for from an expense standpoint. But more importantly, they can recognize the value, and there's a difference between price and cost. And I think we're increasingly seeing customers recognize that value that we're able to deliver for them. But -- so we certainly will continue with our initiatives, and I can't comment on what the other carriers will be doing and what their strategies will be going forward. But I think that, like I mentioned, the last 3 quarters, the other carriers at least, have been negative from a volume standpoint and have continued to push pricing. So it's hard to imagine that, that changes. It certainly seems like that's been favorable to their financial results. There's been general improvement and industry dynamics appears. But yes, our yield philosophy has been different from the group for many years, and certainly it's been rewarding for us and has allowed us to do a lot of things in terms of the investment cycle and the dollars that we've been able to put into our system, to keep growing and to have the baseline. We've probably got 25% excess capacity in the system today. And so we know we're building up from that next big way if the growth comes to us, and we're confident in what our long-term market share capabilities should be and feel like that we can get through the challenges of the short term and softer economic environment. But it's what you do in those upcycles that really make a difference. And so you have a lot of encouraging trends, if you will, for us and just we want to make sure that we stay ahead of the game and have got the capacity, we've got the people and we've got the fleet to be able to take advantage of the next up cycle whenever it starts. Amit Mehrotra : And what about the October versus September data point? Adam Satterfield : Yes, sure. From a tonnage standpoint, and again, keep in mind, we typically don't even talk about the details. We just give sort of an average change in the revenue. But just knowing the sensitivity around at this point. But the number will change a little bit as we finish out these final few days of the month. But right now, what we're seeing from a month-to-date standpoint. It looks like that we're going to be pretty much right in line with the normal sequential change for October. Typically, October decreases about 3.5% sequentially versus September. And we're right in that ballpark. And certainly, it can move around a little bit as we finish out the month. But that's really the first time since February of this year, but the numbers have pretty much been in alignment. So we'll look and see. There's not necessarily a positive catalyst coming, if you will. But if we can kind of keep touch and keep pace with normal sequential trends, the positive catalyst meaning in the economy right now. But if we can kind of keep pace with these normal sequentials as we go through 4Q and 1Q, then we have an idea of what type of buildup we might see sequentially as we start getting into the spring of next year. Operator : The next question comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd Fowler : So Adam, I think you've touched on this in a couple of different ways on the call here, but I just wanted to kind of square up the comments on the weight per shipment. It was up in the third quarter. It sounds like it's still trending positive. But your comments about customers seeing less demand, I would think that, that would have some impact where there just be less freight on each pallet. So can you just talk a little bit about the mix and what's been going on with weight per shipment? It seems like it's in the kind of a normalized level, but just want to make sure that that's the right way to think about it right now. Adam Satterfield : Yes. It -- from a sequential standpoint, it decreased about 10 pounds from the second quarter to the third quarter. And right now in October, it's pretty much about the same as where we were right around 1,560 pounds, if you will. And so yes, if that trend held through the fourth quarter, then we would be looking at a decrease. We took action last year in terms of getting some of the heavier weighted shipments out of our system. Some of those spot quote systems shipments as well. Those spot quote of the total of our business have decreased as a result of what we're doing last year, really in an effort to protect capacity for our existing LTL customers and make sure that we can deliver what they needed. And -- but we started seeing an increase sequentially in the fourth quarter of '21 versus that low watermark that we hit in 3Q. So it went from 1,538 pounds up to 1,575 in 4Q and then increase further in the first quarter of this year to 1,589. And then since that point, it's been declining a bit. But yes, I mean that supporting last year was such a strong fourth quarter in terms of -- we ended up with an increase in our tons per day. It's typically down about 1.5% and we were actually up almost 2.5% sequentially versus the third quarter. So that strength as we went through 4Q was why we had such high expectations coming into this year, and it's just been sort of this flattish environment, if you will, from a volume standpoint all year. But yes, that's kind of what we've been seeing from a weight per shipment standpoint. Todd Fowler : Okay. No, that sounds -- I mean, tonnage being down a little bit the weight per shipment holding in, it seems like a decent combination all things considered. Just for a follow-up, I'm curious if you have any comments on headcount, it was down sequentially I guess is that's probably letting a little bit of attrition kind of run its course, and I don't think the fourth quarter is a big hiring period. But how should we think about the cadence of headcount either sequentially or year-over-year, just given the demand trends? Greg Gantt : Todd, I think you'll continue to see that trend track our shipments. Right now, like you said, we've been simply letting attrition take care of our needs or move it back in the right direction. But -- and we would continue to do that through the first quarter, which is typically our slowest quarter. But we aren't really hiring other filling vacancies and whatnot, but not much going on from that standpoint at this point in time. Todd Fowler : Got it. So you've got a little bit of a glide path for the next couple of quarters just on the attrition front. Greg Gantt : Yes, I think so. But keep in mind, we've continued to have driving schools and continue to work those and continue to get drivers trained because we know this thing will change at some point in time, and we'll come out on the other side in a better position certainly from -- I think, from a driver standpoint and certainly from a capacity standpoint. So I think we're doing some of the right things today to set the stage for when times do recover and get better and as has been in the past in our business, you know that time will come, hopefully, sooner than later. Operator : The next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Adam, I just wanted to follow up on some of the tonnage commentary already. Specifically, if we were to take a little bit of a glass half full approach here, I think you said in the start of the call that you kind of underperformed on share for like 3 to 4 quarters and already 3 quarters into it, if you historically look at like your tonnage stays negative for like 2 or 3 months maximum and you're already kind of pretty much all the way into that. You did say that you don't think that there is a positive catalyst on the horizon. But what are you looking for any potential signs of the cycle may be turning and we may be kind of in a restock kind of uptick position maybe in the next couple of months. Adam Satterfield : Well, I mean, the biggest thing is just the conversations that we've had with customers. Like I said earlier, I think that there's just so much uncertainty in the market today. And that just gets in the psyche of business owners in terms of the risk that they're going to take for capital. I think there's still a labor issue and supply chain issue that is impacting many customers today. And we've heard first hand that just given the uncertainty out there with the economy that some customers have made the decision to not be as aggressive to feel open positions from a labor standpoint for fear of what may come on the demand side for their business. But I think that we certainly -- when you think about there's 3 big layers of uncertainty that people are facing right now, the upcoming midterm elections. And then after that, you've got clarity at least for the next couple of years. But then comes to the energy issue that it's got to be dealt with. We've got to see some type of improvement overall in terms of where fuel prices are and the impact that has on overall inflation for the domestic economy. And I think that if that riddle get solved, then you get some clarity in terms of the interest rate environment. And so I think we've got to start knocking some of those down to get back into a growth type of mode. But even when we look back at prior periods, be it even looking as bad as 2009 was, we started getting growth and the sequential growth that is in the spring of that year. So we had a really bad 4Q '08 and 1Q from a sequential standpoint, like many businesses did. But looking at 2016, another slower environment, same kind of thing where the fourth quarter of '15, things are slowing down. We kind of went through the winter. We started getting build up back in the spring. At some point, people have got to get some inventory back in the system and now there's been a lot of conversation about inventories. But frankly, we continue to face issues in terms of getting parts. Many of our customers give us the same feedback that they don't have the right levels of the inventories in the right places. So that creates freight demand. And we still look at an inventory to sales ratio that's lower than pre-pandemic levels. So I think there's certainly a lot of factors that have got to be dealt with, but just having those conversations with customers and our sales team is doing that on a day in and day out basis. We're trying to figure out what their plans are going into next year, and we take those from each of our sales account representatives, each of our service center imagers at our 255 locations and tried to build that into somewhat a baseline forecast plan to build around from an equipment planning standpoint, headcount planning, service center capacity plan. But that's the best feedback. You can read all the economic reports in the world, but the best is feedback we get from the ground up to help us plan for our business. Ravi Shanker : Great. And maybe as a quick follow-up. I apologize if I missed this and you said it, but are you seeing any signs of TL players kind of trying to encroach into the LTL market kind of given how loose things are on the TL side? Adam Satterfield : Not really. And the reason for that is where that may come into play and has in the past, say, back in a 2018 time frame would be on some of those spot quote-type shipments. Before the strategic actions that we took last year spot quote shipments are like 8,000 to 10,000 pound type loads. And historically, 10,000 pounds somewhat defined the LTL industry. But those heavier shipments, you might have a truckload carrier come in and try to build multiple stops or just be willing to take 1 mode, if you will, and not with that spillover type of freight. But the actions that we took last year were designed to try to get some of that freight that wouldn't be as sticky proactively out of our system. And so as a result, those spot quote shipments that used to average maybe 5% of our total, so a small number overall. It's probably more like 1% to 2% at this point. So we were fortunate that we proactively tried to flush some of that out of the network, really designed us to make sure that we were protecting our consistent LTL shippers and the capacity means that they had, in particular last year and what we thought was going to transpire this year as well. But I don't think looking at some of our competitors wait for shipments that I think some other companies took a similar approach. I don't think that's as big of a kind of a challenge to work through the past. There's -- that freight would swing back into truckload. It creates somewhat a vacuum effect that other carriers would look to feel. I don't think that risk is out there as much as it has been in prior cycles. Operator : The next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Bascome Majors : Following up on Todd's headcount question. If I look at your shipments per employee, they're still, call it, 8% below where they were this quarter in 2019. Can you talk a little bit about maybe a more bottoms-up look at productivity and your own metrics? How does productivity compare to history on the dock right now? How does the driver productivity compare? And just -- is there an opportunity in some of these tops-down metrics that we can calculate to get back to historic levels in a weaker demand environment? Or does it make sense to stay a little long head count in a structurally tighter labor market? Greg Gantt : Yes. I'll answer the last part of your question first, Bascome, but I think it definitely does make sense to stay a little long from a labor standpoint because -- we -- as we've talked about on prior calls, we had to work on an awful lot of harbor in the recent past to ramp up from a driver standpoint, particularly that we have in over the years. It's just much more difficult on like the market, was a heck of a lot tighter, and we did work an awful lot harder than we always had in years before to ramp up. So for sure, we will be a little more diligent on trying to maintain that driver force and keep it as high a level as we possibly can without negatively affecting productivity. To go back to the general productivity question. We're starting to see some improvements from market improvement on the platform, which is a good thing, and it's pretty typical when we get in this environment. Our labor force becomes better trained and more experienced, and we start to see the positive improvement cause change. And we are seeing that now. So that's certainly a good thing. Certainly, we struggle a little bit on the P&D side, the pickup and delivery side because we're obviously just not picking up the same number of shipments that at each stop that we were doing when we were ready to buy. So that's certainly more of a challenge. Your miles between stops and that kind of thing become a little greater and is certainly more difficult to keep up from that standpoint. So obviously, we'll continue to focus on those. We always think we have room for improvement both P&D and platform and from a load factor standpoint. So we're continuing to stay laser-focused on those kind of things and continue to try to drive some cost out when we can and where we can. Operator : The next question comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Unidentified Analyst : This is Matt on for Bruce. Curious to get your current view on net capacity in the industry and maybe how you might expect it to trend over the next couple of years here. Greg Gantt : Well, certainly, I think in this type of environment, there's certainly capacity out there much more so than it was last year back in the mid-2021 and prior. But I think we were the only one that maybe wasn't really suffering from a capacity standpoint. Certainly, we were in better shape than most. And as Adam had mentioned before, we spend an awful lot of money to ramp up from capacity. And I think we've done an extremely good job of that. We continue to stay focused on building capacity. And like I mentioned before, we'll come out of this thing hopefully sooner than later, and we'll be in good shape. But I think there is some capacity obviously out there now. We don't see the same things going on this year that we did last year when carriers were in trouble, they set in bargains and various things to limit pickups and whatnot. And certainly, we're not seeing or hearing about those kind of things now. So yes, there's capacity obviously. But I think the question is, what's everybody doing to try to ramp up the need arises on the other side. And you know what we're doing. We've got a large number of capacity increasing projects underway now, and we'll keep working on those. And again, like I said, be in better shape when volumes do change and when we start to pick back up. So we feel good about where we are. And honestly, what the others do, they do. And we can't -- certainly, can't control that. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Lastly, are you guys seeing any changes or differences in underlying demand by specific end market or geography? Adam Satterfield : No. We've probably seen a little bit better performance with our industrial-related accounts once again in the most recent quarter. It probably grew a couple of hundred basis points faster than the overall company average revenue growth rate. And on the retail side, it was probably a couple of hundred basis points below but overall still seeing growth in all segments, if you will, but there's probably a little bit better performance on the industrial side. And most of our regions, you got some growing a little bit more than others when we look at it. But most are saying fairly balanced, which is a good thing. It's helped us be able to effectively reduce our purchase transportation, which was a positive for the third quarter were effectively back to prepandemic levels in the sense that we're essentially fully insourced again, and that's where we wanted to be because we know that improves our service value overall. And so that's been a positive trend, if you will. But if you don't have somewhat consistent growth in all those regions, you can get a little bit out of balance, and we might not have been able to achieve that objective. So that's been a positive development, at least to help from a service and a cost standpoint. Unidentified Analyst : That's super helpful. Congratulations again on the exceptional performance. Operator : The next question comes from Todd Wadewitz with UBS. Thomas Wadewitz : Yes. It's Tom Wadewitz. Just -- I think, Adam, you gave quite a bit of commentary on September, October, but I don't know if you offered what the revenue per hundredweight was kind of trending in October ex fuel. Can you give us kind of a sense of that? Is that kind of stable? Or where is that at? Adam Satterfield : Yes, pretty stable. Tom, I didn't give a specific number, so to speak, but I just mentioned that it's right in line, maybe a little bit better than what we saw the average for the third quarter. We were up 7.2%, the revenue per hundredweight in the third quarter, excluding fuel surcharge and right about that same level in October. Thomas Wadewitz : So do you think that, that's kind of the level you stabilize at? I mean, I guess you talked about inflation being maybe a bit more stickier, higher than you thought. I think we normally think of maybe 4% to 5% as being what's a normal growth in revenue per hundredweight to get a bit more than inflation. But I guess if you're running with higher inflation, you got to get more price, right? So you think that's the right level? Or do you think that in a weaker -- kind of a weak rate market, you're going to see that decelerate a bit further as you go into 2023? Adam Satterfield : No, I think that when you look at our long-term revenue per shipment performance, so a little bit different than the per 100. But long-term revenue per shipment, we've been able to average between 4.5% to 5%. And that's -- I think whether you look at it in certain years, including fuel or excluding fuel, that's kind of been the goal because long term, our cost per shipment performance has been kind of in that 3% to 3.5% range mainly the increase is that we give to our employees each year from the wage improvement. But we certainly -- we've face the increased cost of equipment and insurance premiums and fortunately have been able to offset some of those other inflationary items through improved productivity and efficiencies within our operations. But we're certainly -- we'll have the same objectives as we go through the rest of this fourth quarter and as we transition into next year as well. Looking at the per hundred, certainly, we had bigger increases in 2021. Some of that started particularly in the back half of the year when inflation was picking up, and this year has been solid increases as well. But the key is just this contracts renewed and they renewed throughout the year for us is to continue to make improvement. So it's -- we work a continuous improvement cycle, whether it's with our yield management, the efficiency of their operations. Every department is looking at continuous improvement. And certainly, we've got to continue with our best efforts there on the yield side. But I think that we'll see core inflation. We certainly hope that, that moderates as we transition into next year. So we shouldn't need as big of an increase perhaps as what we've seen the last two. But certainly, we want to see sequential increases from quarter-to-quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Jonathan Chappell : Adam, just two quick follow-ups for you. First, on the PT brought it up and then answer a couple of questions ago, 2.1% as far as I can tell, is about as low as it's ever been in your network. So as you contemplate keeping maybe more resources from a headcount perspective just because of the challenges in hiring. Is there any more room to flex PT? Or are you kind of at the absolute minimum there? And we think about it holistically, salaries, wages and benefits plus PT probably stays a little bit elevated for the foreseeable future. Adam Satterfield : Yes, that level where we are, we effectively in the third quarter, didn't use any PT within our domestic line haul network. That balance that we've historically had that generally trends between 2% to 2.5% of revenue reflects mainly our -- as we have a little small truckload brokerage operation. So you've got those carrier costs there and then the partners that we have with our Canadian operation as well. Those purchase transportation costs are in that baseline number. So certainly, I wouldn't necessarily expect that to get much lower as a percent of revenue, unless something is changing with those businesses, which we don't foresee. But they get nothing really out there to call, if you will, as it impacts the domestic operation. We certainly flexed up as we went through the balance of 2021 primarily using that PT to supplement our workforce and to a degree, our fleet where some of what I mentioned earlier, we had some regions that were growing much stronger, like coming off the rest as we came out of pandemic was growing incredibly strong and can get your fleet out of balance, if you don't appropriately manage. So that was some of why we were using a little bit of PT as well. It's just to keep the network overall in balance. Jonathan Chappell : Okay. That helps. And then also to tie a couple of things together. I mean, it sounded like you're pretty optimistic. I mean maybe optimistic is a strong word, but not as pessimistic regarding some of your customer commentary. But in your prepared remarks, I wrote down you said directly, demand just isn't there for some of your customers' freight. So do we foresee maybe a late peak season where it's not there today. But going into a time that might seasonally be slower, you start to see a reversion or a catch-up? Or do we kind of just write off the rest of this year as it's going to be weak and maybe things are rightsized by '23 and start to see a pickup then? Adam Satterfield : Yes. For us, we don't have a peak season per se. Usually, September is our busiest month of the year just from a function of the seasonality in our business. And we have pretty consistent seasonal trends year in and year out as we progress, whether it's week-by-week within the months and then month-by-month through the quarters. But nevertheless, I mean, certainly, some of the months that we had in the earlier part of the year coming off the strength of how we finish '21. And it looks like March will be our busiest month in terms of just the average weight and shipments, if you will. But yes, it's just managing through kind of the base levels where we are. Looking at, I mentioned earlier that when we get -- whether it's an up cycle or a down cycle, a lot of times will have 3 to 5 quarters where we either outperform or underperform normal seasonality. And so the third quarter was the third such quarter of underperformance. So we'll just continue to watch the trends, like I mentioned, what we've seen at least through the second and third quarters was just in the months where we see a lot of buildup. We didn't see that same type of acceleration. September, for example, that would normally be up sequentially about 4%, we were up about 0.5%. So will we get the buildup in November? Remains to be seen, and then December kind of drops off. But I feel like if we can kind of somewhat say a little bit closer in touch with our normal sequential trends, through 4Q and 1Q next year, that's kind of looking at getting to the spring and seeing when we start seeing some volumes coming back to the business. 2Q of this year, it's quite a bit different. We're used to seeing volumes increase sequentially about 7.5% from the first quarter to the second quarter, and we were up about 0.7%. So we just haven't had that buildup that we otherwise would see. But yes, it's just going to be a function of kind of getting through and watching these developments. But October generally sets the trend when we look back for the fourth quarter and look back at some prior periods where we were kind of in or going into an economic slowdown, you've had a lot more underperformance, if you will, with October versus September. So that was something that we've been closely watching internally makes us feel a little bit better as we really get into the winter months where we're always going to be a little bit seasonally slower. So it's just a function of continuing to execute on the plan and adjusting as need be to what the overall volume environment dictates. And then just trying to stay engaged with our customers and figure out we would really see that spring build up next year or not. And then all the while, we're probably focusing a little bit more on sequential trends now. Certainly, again, from a year-over-year standpoint, the fourth quarter was so strong. We kind of knew the fourth quarter and the first quarter from a year-over-year standpoint, we're going to need much harder comparisons on the volume side. So that's why we're probably paying a little bit closer attention now to how some of the seasonality has played out for us. Operator : The next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen. Jason Seidl : Just one question for me, and it's sort of been asked in different ways, but how should we think about the industry's continued ability to gain pricing above cost inflation with many larger LTL carriers sort of expanding capacity into a downturn? Is that something we should be concerned about? Or is the fact that we're seeing so much cost inflation across to everybody's network that we should remain confident that everyone is going to maintain pricing discipline that we've seen over the last decade. Adam Satterfield : Yes. Well, we've certainly -- like I mentioned, we've -- the carrier group on average to exclude us has seen negative volumes on a year-over-year basis through the last 3 quarters. And -- but has continued to increase their yields. And so we wouldn't anticipate a lot of change from that. With respect to whether capacity is really being added or not remains to be seen. We've not seen really any material addition. Some people are talking about it. There have been 1 other carrier, I guess, that certainly has increased their service in account. But when you look at the industry, at least the public carriers on average over the last 10 years, there has been a decrease in industry capacity. So don't really foresee a lot of change in that regard as we move forward. But certainly, we'll continue to watch it. But yes, we believe the industry will stay disciplined, but we know what our plan is, what we can control, and we'll continue to control the elements that we can and what the other carriers do will just continue to sort of watch and see. But I think we've got a long-term track record in terms of what we've been able to do over the last 10 years. We've averaged growing our revenue 11% a year, and we certainly have made improvements to the operating ratio along the way. And again, it's been through a combination of consistent improvements in yield and then the density through that -- the volume throughput in the system that's allowed us to produce this consistent operating ratio improvement and different carriers have had different strategies along the way. And certainly recent periods, other carriers have been increasing rates faster than us, but we don't control what they do, but we'll continue to certainly watch. But our conversations with customers are what's going on within Old Dominion, what our cost inflation looks like, the investments that we want to make to help support our customers and the growth in their business. And ultimately, what's the value that we can add to our customer supply chains. And those are the conversations we have versus trying to compare our price versus someone else's price. It's all about value, and that's service value is what has won the day for us and what will continue to drive our ability to win market share in the long term. Jason Seidl : Well, clearly, your game plan has worked. So I think sticking with it is a good thing. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Kenneth Hoexter : Just Adam, just to balance out your last comment there. your 100 basis point revenue over cost you noted before, but also noting higher inflation. I just want to understand, you still target the kind of 50 to 100 basis point operating ratio improvement on a full year going forward? Or does that change if volumes are weaker here? Adam Satterfield : Well, I think we talked a little bit about this earlier, certainly in periods where revenue has been flat or been down. We've had a little bit of OR degradation and generally limited to the depreciation cost as a percent of revenue. And the reason for that is we want to continue to invest for the long-term market share opportunities, we believe we have. And certainly, when you look at the second quarter of 2020, we had a big decrease in revenue that year. But we were a lot more aggressive in terms of managing costs and actually improve the operating ratio of 10 basis points. But I think that looking more a 2016, 2019 for the general performance and doing some of the things that really protect our long-term opportunities, keeping a little bit of inflated headcount, like Greg mentioned earlier, continue with our investment cycle. Those are the types of long-term decisions that we want to make that improve our opportunities for out years to get prepared for maybe what a 2024, 2025 looks like versus just trying to focus too closely on the short term and what the first half of next year might otherwise look like. So certainly, a lot of it depends on the overall revenue environment and what we will see. There's a lot of uncertainty out there, but 2016 and 2019 are probably better examples to look at in terms of how we try to manage the business, manage all over variable cost flat as best we can or prevent any type of increase in deterioration there and those cost elements. And then just might see that those depreciation costs increasing as a percent of revenue because of the investment driving increased depreciation dollars and then you're denominated being potentially flat to down from a revenue standpoint. Kenneth Hoexter : And then the percent of volume, you mentioned from the spot boards, but how about from the third-party carriers, brokers, does that shift in this kind of a market when things get softer, do you add more? Do you keep it steady? How do you think about that strategically? Adam Satterfield : Well, I mean we've got good long-term relationships with many 3PLs. They're about 1/3 of our business overall. A lot of times, what you'll see in a slower macro environment. We're seeing this a little bit now is some of those levels that's 3PL driven that kind of flattened out a little bit. And so we'll continue to watch that, but certainly feel like that a lot of the big 3PL customers that we have, in some ways, can help us a sense of demonstrating the value independently to the shippers that they're potentially helping manage transportation services for and talking through what the different elements of value in terms of our superior service on time, pickups, on-time deliveries, load damages all those sorts of things that they're talking to someone that has just been solely focused on price in the past, they can help us talk more about value. So in some ways, that could be beneficial to us in a slower macro environment. Kenneth Hoexter : So are you seeing that increase as a percentage? Or is it sticking -- does it just stick around that third level up and down in the market? Or are you already seeing a change? Adam Satterfield : No, it's remaining about 1/3. It's just -- the growth is flattening out a little bit with -- in terms of looking at the overall revenue with our 3PLs right now. Kenneth Hoexter : And then last for me is the fuel. It seemed relatively neutral this quarter in terms of kind of a quarterly impact, I guess, versus a huge lag impact last quarter. Does that math sound right to you? And then our -- in your negotiations? Are customers kind of talking. I mean I know you keep raising your rates, but the customers push back even harder now? Are you -- is it a bigger struggle as you go through these negotiations given the volume environment? Adam Satterfield : Well, no. There's always a conversation about total all-in price, if you will, because that's ultimately the bill that the customer is paying. But for us, certainly, there was a slight decrease in the average price of fuel in the third quarter versus the second. So that's something we'll probably talk a little bit about or on the last call. But like I mentioned earlier, we hope that we see that continue to decrease. And I would just say looking at the impact, there's been a lot of questions about that. If we were to see a decrease in the impact of fuel surcharge and our philosophy is we want the fuel surcharge is just one element of pricing and whether fuel goes up or down, we hope that's neutral to the bottom line for us. And probably the best periods to go back and look if we are to get some type of material improvement in fuel prices 2015, the average price of diesel fuel was down about 30% that year. We were fortunate that we still had some volume growth going that year to help us have good revenue trends overall, and we were able to improve the operating ratio. The fuel dropped another 15% in 2016. That year was a little bit different in terms of the overall top line environment and a little bit more pressure from a volume standpoint. But we certainly would like to see overall the fuel price continue to drop. And certainly, that would decrease the all-in price that is being paid today. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Gantt for any closing remarks. Greg Gantt : We thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions, and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and have a great day.

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir. Greg Gantt : Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Marty Freeman, our COO; and Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we would be glad to take your questions. The Old Dominion team produced fourth quarter financial results that allowed us to finish the year with company records for annual revenue and profitability. We extended our track record of success and delivered the 10th straight quarter with both an increase in revenue and improvement in our operating ratio. As a result, the fourth quarter of 2022 was also the 10th straight quarter where we produced double-digit growth in earnings per diluted share. Our team produced these results while facing many challenges during 2022, which were primarily related to the unexpected slowdown in the domestic economy. We entered the year anticipating growth in our volumes that didn't ultimately meet our initial expectations. But we made the necessary adjustments throughout the year that once again showed the flexibility and resiliency of our long-term strategic plan. We also maintained a watchful eye on the efficiency of our operations and continued with our disciplined approach to managing discretionary spending. Due to our confidence in our ability to win market share over the long-term, one thing that did not change in 2022 was our commitment to investing for the future. Capital expenditures, totaling $775.1 million in 2022, were a new company record. And we invested $299.5 million in real estate projects that further expanded the capacity of our service center network. We also continued to invest heavily in our OD Family of employees, with improvements in pay and benefits, as well as a company record contribution to our 401(k) retirement plan for employees. In dealing with the reality of slower than anticipated business volumes we also work diligently to protect the significant investments that we made over the past two years in our new employees. Thinking of new employees, I am proud to share that there have been over 1,300 new drivers that graduated from our internal truck driving school over the past two years. And in some cases, these driver school graduates that now have their CDLs are temporarily working on non-driving roles. While this comes at an increased cost to the company, we believe this bigger pool of licensed drivers will provide us with the strategic advantage once the freight cycle turns and additional volume opportunities become available to us. We said in our third quarter earnings call that we anticipated volumes could start increasing in the spring of this year. And we continue to remain cautiously optimistic that this will occur despite ongoing risk with the domestic economy. Regardless of the economic environment, I believe our 2022 results provide yet another example of why our long-term strategic plan will remain our focus for the foreseeable future. Consistent execution of this plan had helped us create an unmatched value proposition in our industry that led to over $1 billion of revenue growth for the second straight year, in 2022. I am confident that this commitment to our strategic plan will also continue after my retirement at the end of June, this year. Our long-term success is the result of a strong team and their combined commitment to maintaining a strong company culture. After working with Marty for most of my career, I can tell you that he lives and breathes the OD Family spirit, and will help take the company to new heights. I think the best is yet to come for Old Dominion. And I look forward to watching OD expand its long-term record of success. Thank you for joining us this morning. And now, here is Marty Freeman to provide some more details on the fourth quarter. Marty Freeman : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. I would like to start today by thanking Greg and our Board of Directors for providing me the opportunity to lead this great company. It will be an honor to lead our team. And I can assure you that we will work tirelessly to keep producing strong profitable growth. Along those lines, I was pleased with Old Dominion's revenue growth of 5.8%, and the improvement in our operating ratio to 71.2% during the fourth quarter. The combination of these items contributed to the 21.2% increase in earnings per diluted share. These financial results reflect the ongoing strength and demand for our services as we continue to deliver value to our customers by providing superior service at a fair price. While our long-term strategic plan is centered on our ability to provide this value proposition, the real key to our success is our strong family culture and our people. We will continue to invest in our OD Family of employees as our employees are the foundation for building strong customer relationships. We are in a relationship business, and each employee plays a critical role to help deliver our industry-leading service. I am proud to report that our service metrics remained strong during the fourth quarter as we provided 99% on-time service, with a cargo claims ratio of 0.1%. We believe executing our same long-term formula for success will allow us to win market share in the future. And as a result, we will -- also will allow us to constantly advance to new capacity ahead of anticipated growth. Our capital expenditures for 2023 are anticipated to be $800 million, which will improve the average age of our fleet and further expand the capacity of our real estate network. We have invested approximately $2 billion in real estate expansion over the last 10 years, and increased our door capacity by approximately 50% as a result. These investments supported our ability to double our market share over this time. The ever-increasing cost of both real estate and equipment, however, will require us to maintain our pricing discipline. Our long-term pricing philosophy is designed to evaluate the profitability of each customer account, and then obtain the necessary increases to offset our cost inflation, while also supporting our ongoing investment in capacity and technology. As we have executed on this consistent strategy over the years, the resulting improvement in our cash flow has generally supported our ability to invest between 10% and 15% of our revenue into capital expenditures each year. Continuing with each of these priorities demonstrates our team's intention to remain focused on executing the same business strategies that we have created our unique position in this industry. We will continue to focus on our people, servicing our customers, and investing for the future. This commitment to the core principles have differentiated us in the marketplace, gives us confidence in our ability to further produce profitable growth, while also increasing shareholder value. With that, I'll now turn things over to Adam who will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Marty, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue growth, of 5.8% in the fourth quarter, resulted from a 16.7% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight, which more than offset the 9.1% decrease in LTL tons. LTL revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased 8.7% and reflects the continued execution of our long-term pricing initiatives. Our consistent approach to pricing is supported by our ability to provide our customers with superior service and available capacity. We believe this value offering is becoming increasingly important to shipper, which is why we remain absolutely committed to executing on the fundamental elements of our long-term strategic plan. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the fourth quarter decreased 2.4% when compared to the third quarter of 2022, with LTL tons per day decreasing 4.4% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 4.6%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes a decrease of 0.6% in revenue per day, a decrease of 1.3% in tons per day, and a decrease of 3.3% in shipments per day. For January, our revenue per day increased approximately 4.2% as compared to January of 2022. This growth included a 13.1% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight that more than offset the 7.8% decrease in the LTL tons per day. Our fourth quarter operating ratio improved to 71.2%, which is primarily due to an improvement in our direct operating cost as a percent of revenue. Within our direct operating cost, productive labor as a percent of revenue improved 170 basis points, which our purchase transportation costs improved 200 basis points. These changes more than offset the 260 basis point increase in operating supplies and expenses that primarily resulted from a significant increase in the cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products during the quarter. Our overhead costs as a percent of revenue were consistent between the periods compared. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $361.3 million and $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter and 2022, respectively, while capital expenditures were $270.4 million and $775.1 million for the same periods. As Marty mentioned, we currently expect capital expenditures of $800 million in 2023. We utilized $199.9 million and $1.3 billion of cash for our share repurchase program during the fourth quarter and 2022, respectively, while cash dividends totaled $33.0 million and $134.5 million for the same periods. We were pleased that our Board of Directors approved a 33.3% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share for the first quarter of 2023. Our effective tax rate for both fourth quarter 2022 and 2021 was 25.0%. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25.8% for 2023. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jordan Alliger : Yes, hi, good morning. Question, so on the salary expense side of the equation for the fourth quarter, I think the dollar amount was actually down year-over-year. Can you maybe talk a little bit to your thoughts around the drivers of that, just a lower incentive comp, I think I you had mentioned attrition? And then how do we think about the salary line going forward, whether it be on a wage inflation perspective or a growth perspective? Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Sure. The overall dollars, obviously, we've been making adjustments as we've gone through the year. And I would say through the back-half of the year, in particular, we've been letting attrition take place, and just consistently adjusting our headcount and the hours worked by our people in relation to what the volume environment dictates to continue to give service by continuing to operate efficiently. And so, I think, overall, that helped drive the decrease in that quarter-over-quarter, those expenses, if you will. So, we continue to be focused, obviously, on managing those costs. That's our biggest cost element of our business is in the salaries, wages, and benefits. And so, it's certainly the biggest area of focus as we try to continue to run our network as efficiently as possible without giving any sacrifice to service. So, I do think that given the environment in the fourth quarter, I think we had, given the circumstance, is pretty strong revenue performance. So, I was pleased with the way our revenue and volumes trended. And that was probably one of the favorable line items, if you will, in comparison to the guidance that we had originally provided with respect to the operation ratio, was how the salary, wages, and benefits ended up coming in for us. Jordan Alliger : Thanks. And just as a follow-up, is there a way to -- I mean, do you expect that type of control, at least for the first-half, until you get to that inflection, in the spring, in volumes? I mean, could we continue to see that trend line stay the same for the time being? Adam Satterfield : Well, I think we're in a good spot right now with where our headcount is. And typically, we start seeing increases in volume. And certainly, we're not in a normal environment by any stretch. But our January volumes were slightly positive versus December, pretty flattish overall, really when you look at it from a shipment perspective. But we continue to anticipate that we will see volumes return to us in the spring. And I think we want to make sure that we've got all elements of capacity in place to deal with that environment whenever it inevitably comes. We're certainly very confident about what our future market share opportunities will be. And so, we want to make sure that we're in a position with our people, our equipment, and certainly our service and our network to be able to effectively respond when that does happen. Typically, the February volumes are a little bit higher than January. And it's March when we start seeing the increase coming. And so, I think that what we're trying to do is just, again, measure and manage all elements of capacity to ensure that we're in a good spot when that happens. So, again, I think that certainly a lot in the first quarter and probably the first-half of the year really depends on what the volume environment gives us. But we continue to believe that we are going to see some increase. We've certainly seen it in the past, even in down economic environments, whether you look at something as bad as the environment was in 2009. I think 2016 is another good example, where our second quarter volumes were higher than the first. And so, it'll be a little different situation, I think, playing out this year in comparison to 2022, when, beginning with April, our volumes were either decreasing or flattish on a month-over-month basis as we worked our way through the year. Certainly, we'd like to see volumes flowing into us as we transition and make our way through 2023. And hopefully start getting a little help from the macroeconomic environment as well. Jordan Alliger : All right, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead. Jack Atkins : Okay, great. Thank you. Greg, congratulations on your retirement, and I think the $34 billion of shareholder value you've created since you've been CEO. Congrats on that. And Marty, you've got some big shoes to fill, but congratulations to you as well. Marty Freeman : Thank you, Jack. He taught me well. Greg Gantt : Thanks, Jack. Appreciate the kind words. Jack Atkins : Absolutely. Greg Gantt : And it's been a good run. Jack Atkins : Absolutely has been. So, I guess maybe if we could -- Adam, if you could maybe expand a bit on the January trends a bit more. You talked about January being up a bit or maybe even flattish versus December. Anything you feel comfortable sharing there in terms of January revenue trends and tonnage or shipments trends, that'd be helpful? And then, I guess, as you think about the operation ratio, first quarter versus fourth quarter, anything you can maybe share relative to normal seasonality would be helpful there? So, I'll turn it over to you, Adam. Adam Satterfield : Yes, I guess from a volume standpoint on a year-over-year basis, January, our tons per day were down 7.8% that compares to December where we were down 12.3% overall. I would point out and obviously we will continue to give our mid quarter updates. We have a little bit easier comparison with the January year-over-year comp, and we had very strong performance in February of last year. So, that kind of gets a little bit more difficult there. And then, they obviously start getting easier. So, I guess be aware of that when we give that February update in a month or so. But nevertheless, I was pretty pleased with the way really going back through the fourth quarter. December came in a little bit stronger than what our normal sequential change is. And that's the month we kind of talked about I think on the last call in the fourth quarter in particular in some slower economic environment is where we have seen pretty hefty drop-off in our business levels. And the fact that we stayed pretty steady rather I think was a positive takeaway for me. I was hoping that we would see our sequential performance from a volume standpoint to be a little closer to our 10-year average trends. And certainly, it was. The fourth quarter volumes were down 4.4% sequentially, the normal changes of 1.3% decrease. But if we compare back to where we were in the second and third quarters relative to our 10-year average changes, I think, we are starting to trend back in the right direction, and whether or not we get back to the full 10-year average at least in the first-half of the year remains to be seen. I think we probably need a little bit stronger economy. But I do think that we are going to start seeing some increases like we mentioned particularly starting in March and then continuing through the second quarter. And then, we will see where things go from there. But I think that certainly that volume environment really will dictate what the operating ratio does typically just to give a little bit more color on the first quarter operating ratio. We typically have about a 100 basis point increase there coming off the fourth quarter. In this particular first quarter of 2023, we did have a favorable insurance adjustment. We have talked on -- and given the guidance for 4Q assuming that line held steady. There was improvement there. And I think that that will normalize back to around 1.2% of revenue in 1Q of 23. So, that's becomes a 70 basis point or so headwind for us. I think that we are going to continue to see a little bit of a headwind from depreciation as well. We have talked about this as we worked our way through last year that our delivery cycle was a little bit different than prior year. And so, we are probably going to see a little bit more headwind from here. So, on a normalized basis that probably puts us at about 200 basis point increase. So, we are where we just finished the fourth quarter. But -- so, that kind of puts us somewhat flattish if you will on a year-over-year basis if we were to hit that. And certainly, I think if we get better revenue performance, we have got the opportunity to be able to outperform that longer term normalized average. But I think the revenue environment will certainly control a lot of it for us. Jack Atkins : Okay, very helpful. Thanks again. Adam Satterfield : Thanks, Jack. Operator : Our next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Bascome Majors : Following up on the waiver fees, your headcount was down about 3% sequentially. I think that's the biggest decline besides the COVID 2Q '20 jobs that you had since you began reporting this on a quarterly basis. You talked a little bit earlier in one of the other questions about feeling you are in a fairly good place. Can you elaborate a little more? Does that mean your headcount flat to up from here, or flattish and then trend with volumes from here? And just to help put a finer point on that, any commentary on productivity or the cost of heads -- I don't know, labor cost for employer, any other guidance you can get to help us kind of frame the cost piece of that in the expectation? Thank you. Greg Gantt : Thanks, Basc. And this is Greg. But I will take that and try to give you as much color only as possible. But obviously we made some adjustments where we felt like we needed to in headcount. And as Adam mentioned earlier, we talked about attrition. And we have kind of let attrition control some of these adjustments. But we have made some in other places where we needed to. Certainly, we haven't replaced openings likely typically would in a normal cycle where we are growing and what not. But -- and that will continue to be our efforts still thanks to our return of the other ways. So, we will see typically -- we will see a little uptick late February. Going into March, things really start to pickup. So, is that going to be the trend this year? We hope so, but just not absolutely certain. But I think we are in a good spot because as I mentioned in my comments earlier, we've got an awful lot of qualified drivers that we have got work on the platform and what not. They are not driving full time. So, I think we will certainly be ready when the increase does happen, you know, hope it's sooner than later, but definitely we will continue to make adjustments as needed. We talked about this on some of our prior calls. We have been able to make these adjustments in downturns in the past. I think we pretty began we can make adjustments when we need to. We have done it again. We feel good about where we are. We just have to continue to stay on top of it and react as the business dictates. I hope that helps. Bascome Majors : No, it's fairly helpful. To maybe cap that off, any thoughts on items that could impact kind of the cost per head this year? I don't know if there are some variables on incentive comp or other things that might make little bit lengthy versus what we would deem a normal trip based on history? Thank you. Greg Gantt : Not that I know of, Basc, and don't think so. I think it should be fairly normal from that standpoint. We certainly had some good experiences in the recent past with our benefit cost and those kinds of things. So, you just hope that those things continue to be consistent and don't turn the other way for some or no reason. Bascome Majors : Thank you, Greg. Greg Gantt : Sure thing. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good morning, and congratulations also to both of you Greg and Marty. And Greg, yes, just a remarkable run. So, congratulations on the great performance over time. Let's see -- I think -- I guess just in terms of the view on tonnage. I know you have a large customer base. So, maybe it's tough to pars it out. But what would you say about I guess dynamic in terms of volume from retail customers and volume from industrial customers? It seems like probably there has been a lot of weakness and focus on inventory reduction with retail customers. Maybe little less clear what's happened with industrial? So, just trying to think about is there potentially some weakness yet to come with industrial? Have you seen pretty big difference in the volumes from those two groups? And so, kind of any thoughts on that topic would be helpful. Thank you. Greg Gantt : Good morning, Tom. I would say during the fourth quarter we saw a pretty consistent revenue performance with both our industrial customer base and our retail customer base. I would say earlier part of the year we had seen a little bit stronger performance on the industrial side. And those two kind of converged, if you will, in the fourth quarter. Obviously, our customer bases leans more industrial than retail. We are still 55% to 60% industrial overall and 25% to 30% or so on the retail side. In longer term that retail business has been growing faster than the industrial. And I think that reflects some of the ecommerce trends and the effects of those on our customer supply chains. And we certainly continue to believe that that will be a longer term tailwind for us. And I think that as we start working through 2023. And we believe that we will start seeing customer's orders for their products picking up and some inventory rebalancing if you will. And I think that's why we've seen in some of the prior slow period that I spoke of earlier why you start seeing that orders and freight flows kind of leading the other macroeconomic indicator. So, we believe that the freight cycle will starting turning. And we will start seeing some pick up. And it's through these customer interactions and conversations that, that support our belief that we're going to start seeing freight flow, and again, as we get into March and into the second quarter. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, but it sounds like you haven't seen a big difference, maybe over the past, in 4Q or even 3Q, in performance from industrial and retail, and I guess looking forward, you think maybe both of them kind of bottom and improve at the same time. Greg Gantt : And maybe we start seeing retail outperform again, while I assume, and some of the industrial numbers look a little bit weaker, we start getting some of that retail performance as an offset, leading us out and eventually we'll start seeing the industrial picking back up again. Tom Wadewitz : Right, okay, great. Thanks for the time. Greg Gantt : Thanks, Tom. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Christian Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Yes, congrats. Absolutely to Greg and Marty, it's been a heck of a run, certainly, Greg. When I guess I wanted to talk a little bit about how you guys are planning for the potential improvement in tonnage that you may see in the spring, you guys have always been very good at being out in front of potential opportunities. But do you think that there are incremental costs that need to come on the network. Before that happens, are you fairly comfortable being able to sort of let tonnage lead you out of this to drive incremental margins, which obviously, you guys have performed quite well with over time? Greg Gantt : Yes, I think that, Chris, that some of the conversation earlier about headcount, probably on paper, we may be a little bit heavy now, if you just look at things statistically, if you will. But that's kind of the point of the, what we've said is, I think that we're in a good spot, with our headcount with our fleet, and certainly with the service center network to be able to let volume start flowing again. And when we talk about increases, just keep in mind that we're talking about sequential increases, and certainly with the year-over-year comps, particularly in the first-half of the year, we've got some tougher year-over-year comparisons there before we get back to, does being able to show year-over-year growth. But I think that'll be the important thing for us to continue to watch is, are we seeing those types of sequential increases? And certainly we've got a lot of flexibility within our workforce. And I think that, given the team that we have, and the current levels, we should be able to respond to growth when it starts coming at us and get some good leverage, as it does. But certainly we're looking at right now in the first quarter. Like I mentioned, with the January tonnage levels, we've got probably the volumes that are going to be the toughest comp, and certainly, overall, the fourth quarter we were down 9.1%. Our yield performance is still looking good. And we certainly expect to continue to push for core yield increases this year to offset our cost inflation, as well. But there could become some converging factors, if you will, that drive the top line, depending on what the overall fuel environment looks like, and so forth. But we're certainly going to continue to look and execute on the same pricing philosophy that we have in the past and look for cost plus increases to offset the cost inflation that we see in the business and to keep supporting these expensive investments that we're making in our real estate network and technologies that can both improve customer service, but also drive further operating efficiencies for us. So, a lot of things to kind of manage through it particularly the first-half of this year, but I think we're in a good spot to be able to handle the volumes if they do backflow our way. Christian Wetherbee : Yes, that's very helpful. I appreciate that, that color. On the point of pricing, just to follow-up, ex-fuel yield did accelerate, the year-over-year growth that accelerate in the fourth quarter, and I guess they're guiding the first quarter or roughly speaking to around flattish which may coincide with the worst tonnage, you're going to see from a year-over-year standpoint. So, when you take a step back and think about 2023, more broadly, is OR expansion on the table, given those circumstances is pricing good enough to be able to offset inflation as we go and tonnage potentially gets less worse as the year progresses? Greg Gantt : Well, I think that again, the revenue environment will have a lot to say about that, more broadly speaking, we've talked and kind of pointed everyone to our performance in 2016 and 2019, when we've been in a flatter revenue environment, certainly, given the planned investment of about $800 million in capital expenditures this year. And with some pressures that we'll see on depreciation, starting earlier in the year than normal, we will have some pressures, if you will, on those overhead costs. And we saw a little bit of that in the fourth quarter already where overhead costs as a percent of revenue were flat in 4Q '22 versus 4Q '21. But like we did in '16 and in '19, the focus when we're in a flat to a down revenue environment will be managing our variable costs flat, and we'd love to see improvement, but trying to hold all those costs flat. And then, any deterioration if there is anything would be in those overhead costs in particular, on the depreciation side. And so, I think that in '16, we certainly saw a little bit of a decrease in the operating ratio or an increase, rather depending on how you look at it. But I think our operating ratio deteriorated 60 basis points that year. And that was something that was right in line with the change in the depreciation line item. And then, '19 was the same thing, where we had 30 basis points deterioration there. So, we'll take it quarter-by-quarter, certainly, and we'll talk as we get to the end of next quarter's call about what we think we may be able to do in 2Q, but certainly feel like we're probably going to have a little bit more pressure on the overhead side this year if we are in fact a flat to slightly down revenue environment, but there's still a lot up in the air when it comes to the top line for this year. Christian Wetherbee : Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks for the time, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys, and again, congrats, Greg and Marty. I was wondering, can you give us some of the yields ex-fuel accelerated in Q4, is any color, is underlying pricing accelerating here? And then, Adam, I think you talked about 13% total yield growth in January, anyway you can just help us on the gross and on the net of fuel, I just want to understand that that net of fuel is continuing to accelerate? Thank you. Adam Satterfield : Yes, net of fuel in January was about 8.5%. So, fairly consistent with what we just did in the fourth quarter overall. And we are starting to see a decrease in fuel. And we'll see how that continues to trend this year. And so, perhaps the yield with and without the fuel, those two numbers will maybe be a little bit more consistent. I think that fuel hold steady with where we are right now, it certainly becomes a headwind as we get into the later quarters of the year, but nonetheless, I think that certainly there's always mix changes that can drive that number, higher or lower. But I think it's pretty consistent with what our long-term philosophy has been. We certainly dealt with higher cost inflation on a per shipment basis in 2022 than then what at least I initially expected I thought we would see some cost moderation as we got into the back-half of the year, which obviously did not happen. So, we just continue to execute on that same consistent philosophy that we always have. And I think that's why we saw that the yield performance that we did, but I believe that call should be a little bit more favorable versus the last couple of years. And 2023 are certainly that's our hope. And we'll continue to build our cost model around what that cost inflation expectation is and then continue to try to achieve 100 to 150 basis points of positive spread above that inflation to again support the investments that we're going to make. So, I think overall, if you did sort of roll out typically the first quarter our yield metrics are up about 0.5% over the fourth quarter. We'd expect to continue to see if mix is constant. Those numbers increase sequentially quarter-after-quarter, but certainly that some of that, that growth if you will may start to moderate a bit but again you're going to see that same type of moderation or should, what the costs. But nonetheless, the overall philosophy stays the same, and we'll continue to look for cost plus pricing. Scott Group : Very helpful. And just because you mentioned the fuel, and maybe the surcharge revenue and flex negative, how does that impact your thoughts on the question earlier about operating ratio improvement this year? Greg Gantt : Well, again, it's just it's one of the drivers on the top line, that is a change that we will deal with. And I think overall, it would be a positive for the economy and something that would be good to see. But I don't know anybody that would like showing up at the pump and seeing that bigger number. And certainly, that's been a big cost driver for what we've seen. I think it's better to for just cost inflation and other line items. I think the increased cost of fuel is driving inflation and about anything, whether it's a product or service that we're buying. And so, I think a decrease there certainly helps. But as we look back 2015-2016 were the timeframes that we last went through a bigger decrease in average fuel prices. And I think we continue to try to manage, just like we did in those periods, and continuing to manage the different components that go into building out our rates with customers, whether it's base rates, fuel surcharge, or as is oils managing all the revenue inputs with the cost inputs and trying to account for whether or not fuel goes up or down. So, it's just something that our pricing and costing teams and our sales teams have got to work through is we're working through renewals with our customers every day, and just looking at and seeing where we are and what we feel like we need to keep driving improvement in our customer specific pricing and profitability. Scott Group : Very helpful. Thank you, guys. Greg Gantt : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Allison Poliniak : Hi, good morning. I just want to ask about potential customer attrition, just given some of the freight challenges out there and certainly your customer focus on costs. Are you seeing any sort of attrition as customers try to tray down obviously, quality but prices low or the dynamics may be a little different this cycle, just any thoughts there? Marty Freeman : Yes, good morning. This is Marty, I'll take that one. We aren't seeing anything like we saw back in '08 or '09. We have customers in here every week, and our larger customers, contract customers coming in. Its business is usual. They're coming in and asking for contract renewals, additional services and so forth. So, we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary for the economic circumstances, no major price cutting or anything like that. So, I feel pretty confident that the end is probably near what we're going through. Allison Poliniak : Perfect, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Marty, since we have you, as you're entering, you're already there. But you're entering the head seat and the best mousetrap in the industry probably on the precipice of breaking the 70 OR basis. You've already laid out your CapEx for this year. But as you think strategically over the next few years, anything you're thinking about differently as it relates to growth, as it relates to the labor et cetera or is it just kind of ride the cycles of what you've had and continue to get incremental productivity out of that mousetrap? Marty Freeman : Well, one of the reasons we've been able to grow like we have over the last years is because we continue to build capacity even during slow times, and I don't see us moving away from that focus. So, we'll continue to do that. We'll continue to buy new equipment and hire employees as needed. So, I don't see any change from what we've been doing, this made us successful in the past. Jon Chappell : Thanks, Marty. Operator : Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Congrats Greg and Marty and Marty, yes, please don't change the thing, just do -- in that seat and anything. A couple of follow-ups here, do you feel like you have a better ability to capture that spring inflection in growth if it comes versus peers given how much free capacity you have? And do you have a sense of your ability to grow into that volume relative to peers? Adam Satterfield : I don't know about relative to peers, but certainly, we feel confident about our ability to grow. And I think you look at things in the past, we've certainly have been outgrowing the market relative over the last 10 years, in particular, year in and year out. When we're in up cycles, that's when our business shines the brightest. And certainly, our service is what wins us share and have an available capacity to respond to customers when they need us the most. That's kind of our hallmark. And so, we're sitting in a very good spot right now to be able to respond to that growth when the phone calls come, we're going to be picking them up. Ravi Shanker : Got it, sounds good. And maybe as a follow-up kind of on the fuel topic, I mean, there's been a lot of speculation in the investment community about like fuel and kind of how much is driven earnings. And I think a lot of you -- I mean, you and your lot of your peers have been saying that, hey, there's a new algorithm when it comes to fuel pricing and it's stickier than you think, et cetera, et cetera. So, how do we think about how fuel becomes a headwind in the back-half of the year kind of there's any way to quantify that? And also kind of how much of that fuel can be sticky and kind of convert the base rate over time, do you think? Adam Satterfield : It's something that's -- we certainly faced this question before when fuel changes. I think that we got a pretty long period where we were at low fuel prices kind of going back to when that final decrease happened in 2016. And I'd say we had pretty good results between 2016 and 2020 when we were in a lower fuel environment. And again, I think that it's something that maybe people on the Street, it's hard to understand if you're not negotiating with some of these types of contracts. But for us, it's all about having a good cost model, understanding our cost and knowing what the revenue and the cost inputs are going to be whether fuels at $5 a gallon or $3 a gallon, it's just something that we've got to manage through. In some environment, some customers may want more or less and increase coming through, a base rate type of change, some may want more exposure to that variable component of pricing that would be the fuel surcharge. And there's ways to increase yields by driving productivity with customers as well, where we can obtain the same objective by just looking at the operational factors underneath, and having all of our systems tied into our cost model allows us to have those types of conversations with our customers as well. Ultimately, it's just about driving customer-specific profitability improvement and work in our continuous improvement cycle so that we can continue to purchase real estate and expand our network. So, customers have got that to leverage within their own supply chains. We're effectively buying capacity on behalf of our customers. So, I think we got to just continue to execute on that front. And I think that we've shown in terms of going through prior cycles that we'll be able to do so. Ravi Shanker : Understood, thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ken Hoexter : Great, good morning, and again congrats, Greg, on your tenure, and Marty, on the new role. Just a quick clarification, I guess, on that spring pickup you've talked a bit about. Is that just comp based? Or is there a commentary you're hearing from customer comments or just I guess on showing up inventories? I just want to understand why the -- I guess, the confidence in that given the market and then my question is on depreciation. You know the depreciation is going to be higher. Last year, you targeted, I think it was $485 million on equipment at the beginning of this year -- at the beginning of the year. This year, you're doing $400 million on equipment. Is that because the delivery schedule was slower? Is -- what's your view on getting that equipment? And does that still allow you to stay at that 20%, 25% excess capacity that you typically target? Thanks. Greg Gantt : Yes, Ken, this is Greg. I think so on the -- I'll take your revenue question first, but we typically always pick up in the spring. So, certainly, we're hopeful that we get back into a more normal cycle than what we've certainly been in really since COVID. We've kind of been off cycle, if you will, if that makes sense. And the normal numbers and sequentials that we compare with all over the years, they're just been different in the last couple of years. So, certainly, getting back to a normal cycle would be one reason we are somewhat hopeful. Some of the things that we've seen, heard and read, inventories are starting to get low compared to where they were back, say, a year or six months ago. So, I think there are some things that lead us to believe that we could be coming out of this thing, plus we've been through many, many cycles over the years. And typically, they're a year, 16 months, so we kind of think that that's what we've been in this one. So, yes, we're hopeful, got our fingers crossed that we will come out of this thing as we get into the spring and later on in the second quarter. As far as the equipment, yes, it's been kind of funky. The deliveries that we -- cycle that we've been on this time. We certainly didn't get everything back last year like we typically would. Typically, we would have all of our orders in the early fall. We had everything in place that wasn't the case this year. We're actually still taking some equipment that we should have gotten back last year. So, it's been a little different. So, we'll just have to see how the business develops, and I think that's going to determine where that $400 million that we talked about number, where that goes this year. So, we'll just have to see, and it will certainly be based on our business conditions and the numbers that we see as we get on into 2023 as to how that $400 million develops this year compared to last year. Ken Hoexter : Great, thanks, Greg. Appreciate the time. Operator : Your next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, Operator. Hi, everyone, Greg, hearty congratulations on the retirement; and Marty, looking forward to working with you as well. I guess I wanted to ask about pricing. I know pricing discipline is good, so it's not really about that, but I guess we've seen a lot of LTL companies in recent months announced general rate increases. I guess what's surprising to me is some of the ones that have even a little bit weaker service that may be more tempted to lean into price have also announced big price increases. And I wanted to understand like the reaction from the customers because, in the typical cycle, a customer would maybe trade down to regional lanes with high-quality carriers. Maybe you lose 20%, 30% of your lanes or two or three lanes or whatever it is, that doesn't seem to be occurring right now where shippers are not moving to other high-quality, but regional lanes. And I want to understand, one, why you think that might be like what's the psychology of your customers in terms of how they think this cycle is going to play out? And then second, how does that impact your ability to bounce back? Because I would assume as there's a big seasonal pull in March and April, May. You don't have to win back lanes, you don't have to win back customers so you can kind of see it first in terms of that upswing. So, sorry for the long-winded question, but hopefully that was clear. Adam Satterfield : I don't know if I can explain the psychology of our customers, but I did take a psych class in college one, so I'll give it a shot, but I think that we've talked a lot about this that since going through COVID, there's been so much disruption to customer's supply chains and missed revenue opportunities, incremental cost added to production lines just because of all the supply chain challenges that many of our customers have been dealing with over the last couple of years. So, I think, for that reason, we've seen a little bit of change in customer behavior. I think customers have been sticking with us. And certainly, over the last year, as Marty mentioned earlier, despite the weakness that we've seen in the economy, we've seen good customer trends. We get periodic reporting from our national account sales teams. And we just -- we have not been losing customer accounts. I think customers have been keeping us in place because they inevitably know that one that many are still dealing with challenges. A lot of the conversations that we continue to have are more around challenges within the supply chain. And I think two is that they know that we are probably closer to things turning and orders picking back up for our customers' products. And they want to make sure that they have got capacity that's available as needed. There are a lot of competitors that had embargoes in places and communication to customers saying I am keeping you up today. But I can't pick you up tomorrow. And we were able to respond in particular in 2021 to a lot of those customers that called on us needing capacity. And so, I think that that's strengthened the relationships that we have with our customers. And we have got a lot of continuity within our customer base anyway. So, I think those -- everything that's happened over the last couple of years has really strengthened those customer relationships. So, I think that one of the things you said as part of your questions though gives us a little confidence in terms of when those orders for our customer product start picking up again in the sense that in prior cycles like 2016 or 2019 where we may have lost a few lanes or lost a customer account, we were always confident that the business would return to us in many case because the customer told us that they wanted to bring this back in when they could. But we had to wait until the next bid cycle before we got that opportunity. Customers are keeping us in place. They are keeping their contracts current, pricing terms updated. And so, I feel like that whenever those orders start picking up, we may be getting three shipments instead of two at every pick up. And volumes should return to us quicker than perhaps they have in prior down cycles. Amit Mehrotra : Right. Okay, very good. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Ari Rosa : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And, congrats Greg, it's certainly been an impressive run that you have, and congrats also to Marty on some big shoes to fill here. So, I wanted to ask about you guys have talked about for some time the ability to get the OR into the 60s. I understand obviously there are different puts and takes on kind of economic uncertainty, maybe some cost inflammation, but also talking about this inflection that's expected for second quarter, it seems like there is some optimism there around the ability to perhaps improve OR year-over-year which would certainly suggest that you are kind of bumping up against that ability to get the OR to the 60s. I just want to get your updated thoughts kind of given the progression of OR improvement that we have seen over the last couple of years, do you think that OR in the 60s is achievable whether it's 2023 or into 2024? Adam Satterfield : Well, again I think we were saying earlier, certainly 2023 just given the environment it's certainly going to be a little bit more challenging. And we are continuing to keep our eye for the future. We are investing or planning to invest $800 million in capital expenditures this year when the economy is certainly soft right now. And we may end up being in a flattish type of revenue environment. So, revenue will certainly dictate a lot. But I think that just given the comparison to the two years that we have talked about, you can make your own assessments into what you think revenue may end up being for us this year. But if we are in a flattish revenue environment, then certainly we have seen the operating ratio increase slightly in those years. But the positioning that we are going through is to make sure that we are in a great position to be able to respond when that inflection does happen and we get back to a revenue growth environment. And we've averaged to 11% to 12% of revenue growth per year over the last 10 years. And we think of ourselves as a growth company. But, we are certainly going to be disciplined in periods where the economy is softer. And we have seen flattish type of revenue in those environments in the past when the economy has been slower. So, I think certainly a lot of depends on that. But, we had many type of OR degradation in the short run. I mean just for this year, the positioning in the recovery year is usually pretty doggone strong. And so, we continue to stand behind our goal of wanting to get to a sub-70% operating ratio. We didn't put a timeframe behind that when we laid it out last year, at this time, for this sole reason; we don't want to be beholden to something that's, in the short-run, that may jeopardize our opportunity for producing strong profitable growth in 2024, '25, and beyond. And I'm confident that we'll certainly be able to get to sub-70% for the year. We certainly did it for two quarters this year, in the second and third quarters. And so, I think we've shown that it can be done. And just to be clear, we continue to say that that is our next goal, but it will not be the final goal. We think that we can continue to go further from there, but we're going to keep that goal in sight for now. And once we achieve it, then we'll lay out where the next stop might be in this long-term OR journey. Ari Rosa : Got it, understood. And then I wanted to ask also, as I think about the conditions that you've kind of been describing for 2022, where volumes have been a little bit softer than what you would have hoped for. Obviously, we've seen the headcount come down. And yet, your earnings growth was obviously strong this year, at 35%-plus. To what extent, when you're going out and talking to customers who maybe were a little bit squeezed on capacity during COVID conditions, as supply chains normalize, does that put a little bit of a headwind on your ability to go to customers and ask for rate increases? Or conversely, do they push back and say, \"Look, we gave you rate increases when capacity was really tight,\" but now the supply chain's kind of normalized a little bit, are they pushing back any more on some of the rate increases relative to what they were over the past 12 to 18 months? Greg Gantt : I think the answer to that is yes. They push harder when they know they -- either they are in a position to do so. And certainly with the conditions being soft like they've been, yes, they're pushing us for not as big of an increase, and that kind of thing. But you got to remember, we don't necessarily go into a customer and start talking about price. We talk about the value that we provide that customer, and that's what we will continue to sell them. We sell them value. And many times, value and price are pretty darn close, if you know what I mean, because if you're not getting value, what does the price matter? So, that's what we'll continue to sell. And thankfully, I think our customers have seen that, and in what OD has delivered over the years. And that's a huge reason for the success that we've had. So, we'll continue to focus on selling value, and not price. And honestly, try not to have those conversations. Marty Freeman : I wanted to thank our sales team who does a fantastic job of sharing our costing with our customers, especially our large customers. We're an open book; we actually show them what we're paying for equipment, how much it costs not to put -- freight, pick it up, sort and flag it, whatever the cost may be. And once you explain to them what our costs are, it's a lot easier to swallow a general rate increase. So, I think most of our customers understand what our costs are. And we try to explain that to the best of our ability. Ari Rosa : Okay, makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the time and the thoughtful answers, and congrats again, Greg and Marty. Marty Freeman : Thanks. Greg Gantt : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much. And I'll also echo congratulations, Greg, and congratulations, Marty. A lot of my questions have been answered at this point. Just a real quick one on fuel and the potential headwind that you were talking a little bit about, for '23, if I just look at this quarter, fuel surcharge revenue up $97 million incrementally, fuel expense up $48 million incrementally, so -- or $49 million. So, that the net of that was a positive $48 million. Total operating income was a positive $58 million. So, I guess part one is, is the math that simple, that of the $58 million operating improvement, $48 million was the fuel differential. And then I guess, if so, as I look at '23, given where fuel is right now, can you put or quantify what the magnitude of that headwind would be, say, the fuel surcharge component coming down, which you alluded to in the January data, versus fuel expense? Adam Satterfield : Yes, the short answer is that the math is really not that simple. Going back to prior comments, fuel is just one of many elements that get negotiated as part of a customer's rate each year. So, it could be that we get more fuel surcharge in one particular more, more base rate in another. And so, trying to look out and measure what the surcharge revenue piece is versus what the potential expense might be is not really a one-for-one comparison in that regard. The surcharge, if a customer has decided to take on more variable exposure to that fluctuation in fuel is covering many more cost elements than just the cost of fuel and other petroleum-based products. Certainly that's what it's designed to cover, but that's not everything that is covered by that variable component of pricing. So, again, I think the -- if you want to look back into a declining fuel environment, I would point people to look at 2015, and 2016. In '15, the average price of fuel was down 30% that year. Of course, we had volume growth, it was a little different macro environment, and so as a result we were able to improve the operating ratio that year. In '16, the average price of fuel decreased further. It decreased about 15% that year, and that was one of the years, as I mentioned earlier, that we had a 60 basis point increase in the operating ratio. That the overall macro was a little softer, volumes were certainly flattish that year. And so, a little bit different top line makeup, if you will. But so, that's probably a little bit more relative comparison, is looking back at how some of those revenue changes quarter-to-quarter, and cost changes progressed in that year. But we're certainly managing through it. And we're looking at -- we've got contracts that turn over every day, and they progress through the year. So, if fuel stays where it is today, then we're looking at a contract with a base rate of a fuel at $4.58 a gallon versus, last year, we were looking at it and it would have been $5-something per gallon. So, you just always got to look at what the current environment looks like, and then try to risk-adjust for do you think fuel prices may go up? If they do, again, how does the top line for each individual customer account change, and what do the cost inputs change? If fuel goes down, you do the same thing, and you try to make sure that those fuel scales, as they work on each customer account, that we're still effectively getting paid for the service that we're providing and, like Greg said, the value that we are offering. And so that's what we stay focused on. And it's less important for us to look at the profitability of each customer account. Jeff Kauffman : All right, thank you for the clarification. But math for the fourth quarter would be fair at face value, but there's more uncertainty, to your point, looking to '23. Is that the right way to think about it? Adam Satterfield : Well, it -- certainly there is uncertainty with respect to what fuel may end up averaging. We had -- we have seen it declining a little bit more, and then it kind of reverted back and had a little bit of an increase over the last couple weeks as well. But certainly, if it holds steady from here, then maybe we see fuel prices that are down 10% or so this year. But I think it's better for the U.S. economy if we get back to a lower fuel environment. And certainly, we will deal with that from a company standpoint, it's not going to change our long-term objectives, and we're not changing our operating ratio, goals, just because fuel may ultimately decline. Those are certainly built into what our longer-term forecasts are. We think that it should decline overall, and hopefully we get back to a lower fuel environment.

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir. Greg Gantt : Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Marty Freeman, our COO; and Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. The OD team started this year with first quarter financial results that included revenue of $1.4 billion, an operating ratio of 73.4% and earnings per diluted share of $2.58. These numbers were slightly below our first quarter results from 2022 and reflect the ongoing softness in the domestic economy and the challenging operating environment. We are also coming off a record year in 2022 where revenue and profits were at an all-time high. As we started this year, we were cautiously optimistic that our business levels would start to improve late in the first quarter and accelerate further in the second quarter. While our volumes stabilized during January and February as expected, we have not seen the acceleration in volumes that was originally anticipated. Our shipments per day have remained consistent on a daily basis so far this year, but on a year-over-year basis, shipments in April are trending down double digits. Fortunately, our market share has remained relatively consistent and our yield continues to improve. We believe the stability with our market share during the first quarter reflects the value of our service offering and the success of our long term strategic plan. The guiding principles of this plan have been in place for many years and have helped us produce a strong track record for long term profitable growth throughout the economic cycle. This plan is centered on our ability to deliver superior service at a fair price to our customers, and we remain committed to providing on-time service and claims free service as well. We will continue to focus on delivering a value proposition to our customers while also maintaining a disciplined approach to managing the fundamental aspects of our business. This will include making the best decisions to help us navigate through a challenging environment in the short term while also positioning us for future opportunities to produce long term profitable growth. While we like to measure our success over years, we believe it takes winning on a daily, weekly and monthly basis to add up to long term success. Our consistent focus and successful balance of long term opportunities against short term trends has helped us achieve a 10 year compound average growth rate in revenue and earnings per diluted share of 11.4% and 25%, respectively. I want to close my last earnings call as CEO by saying how incredibly proud I am of the entire OD family of employees, all 23,000 of us, and the track record of success that we have produced together. I am encouraged by the prospects that our team has for future growth. Without any doubt, I stand firm in my belief that OD has the strongest team in the industry, the best service in the industry and is better positioned than any LTL carrier to continue to win market share, while also increasing shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning.  And now I will turn things over to Marty for further discussion of the first quarter. Marty Freeman : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. I want to, first of all, start by thanking Greg for his leadership and significant contributions to OD over his career, while also recognizing each OD employee for their critical role in our success. Together, we have produced remarkable improvement in our financial and operating results over the long term. And I can assure you that OD's team remains focused on continuing our record of strong profitable growth. With respect to our first quarter, we delivered solid financial results, especially when considering the ongoing softness in the domestic economy and decrease in volumes. Although these factors contributed to the first decrease in quarterly revenue and earnings per diluted share since the second quarter of 2020, our market share has remained relatively consistent. As a result, we believe our decrease in volumes was largely due to some shippers simply having fewer shipments than normal due to the economy. Although there have been others that are beginning to emphasize price versus service and choosing lower priced carriers. The operating environment has become more challenging than we anticipated and the expected acceleration in volumes has obviously not occurred. Despite these factors, we have maintained a commitment to our long term strategic plan. We will continue to focus on providing shippers with superior service to support our ability to maintain our price discipline. Our consistent cost based approach to manage yield and account profitability has been critical to our ability to improve our financial position over time, which has helped us support and continued investments in technology and service center capacity. While capacity is not currently an industry issue due to the weakness in industry volumes, we believe this will once again become a critical differentiator for us when the economy improves. We believe our long term consistent investment in service center capacity has been and remains a strategic advantage that supports our long term market share goals. During this period of revenue decline, we will also maintain a disciplined approach to managing our variable cost and discretionary spending to protect our profitability. This starts with a commitment to maximizing the operating efficiency of our fleet and network. Some of our productivity measurements in the first quarter were negatively impacted by the general loss of operating density associated with the decrease in our shipments and weight per shipment. This was evidenced by a 4.9% decrease in our linehaul latent load average and a 1% decrease in our P&D shipments per hour. We improved our platform productivity, however, and generated a 5.8% increase in our platform shipments per hour. We also reduced our reliance on purchase transportation as compared to the first quarter of 2022, which allowed us to improve the overall efficiency of our operations. This contributed to the improvement in our variable cost as a percent of revenue during the first quarter. We will also continue to work on improving the efficiency of our operations as we make our way through the balance of this year, which provides an opportunity to generate additional cost savings. While productivity is always a focus, we cannot and we will not allow it to impact our best-in-class service performance. Our team continued to deliver superior service during the first quarter with an on-time service of 99% and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1%. This service performance remains critical to support our yield management strategies. We have said many times before that to produce long term improvement in our operating ratio will continue to require a balance between operating density and yield management, both of which generally require a favorable macroeconomic environment. As just mentioned, we lost operating density in the quarter in the current environment due to the decline in volumes and the expansion of our network. Our yield has continued to consistently improve, however, and revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 8.6% during the first quarter. We will continue to demonstrate value to our customers by balancing our superior service offering with a consistent cost based approach to our pricing. The resulting value proposition is unmatched in the LTL industry and will continue to support our ability to increase market share over the long term. As we look forward to remaining quarters of this year, we currently anticipate the softer demand environment will continue. The second quarter is generally the period when volumes begin to accelerate, but we have yet to see an inflection towards growth. Nevertheless, I want to emphasize that we are well positioned to respond to any acceleration in volumes that might occur if and when the economy improves. Until that time comes, we will continue to focus on managing our costs and delivering value to our customers through our value proposition of on-time claims free service at a fair price. Delivering value is a central element of our long term strategic plan and we remain committed to execute on this plan regardless of the economic cycle. As a critical part of this plan, we will also continue to execute our capital expenditure program and most importantly, invest in the training, education and development of our OD family of employees. The economy will eventually recover and we are confident that when it does, our team's execution will allow us to achieve further growth and profitability while also increasing our shareholder value. Thanks for joining us today. Adam will now discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Marty, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue decreased 3.7% in the first quarter of 2023 due to an 11.9% decrease in LTL tonnage that was partially offset by 9.2% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. The combination of this decrease in revenue and slight deterioration in our operating ratio contributed to the 0.8% decrease in earnings per diluted share to $2.58 for the quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the first quarter decreased 7.9% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 with the LTL tons per day decreasing 4.3% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 3.4%. For comparison, the 10 year average sequential change for these metrics includes a decrease of 0.6% in revenue per day, a 0.5% decrease in tonnes per day and a 0.2% increase in shipments per day. The monthly sequential changes in the LTL tonnes per day during the first quarter were as follows. January decreased 1.0% as compared with December, February decreased 0.2% versus January and March increased 0.7% as compared to February. The 10 year average change for the respective months was an increase of 1.2% in January, an increase of 1.7% in February and an increase of 5.2% in March. Our shipments per day over these same periods were relatively consistent on a sequential basis and increased slightly each month as we progressed through the first quarter. While there are still a few work days remaining in April, our month-to-date revenue per day has decreased by approximately 15% when compared to April of 2022. Our LTL tonnage per day has also decreased by approximately 15%, while revenue per hundredweight has increased approximately 1% when including fuel surcharges and increased approximately 7.5% excluding fuel surcharges. Our revenue and shipment counts on a daily basis have been relatively consistent in April when compared to March of this year, except for the Good Friday and Easter holidays. As previously mentioned, however, we had expected to see acceleration in business levels by this point in the year based on customer feedback and our historical planning process. While we would like to see our market share continue to increase again, we believe that it's more important to maintain our price discipline during this period of economic weakness, while positioning ourselves to emerge from a slow period with capacity and a better opportunity to produce strong profitable growth over the long term. We have operated in scenarios like this before and we will continue to execute our plan and adjust to this lower than expected volume environment until an inflection point happens and we can shift back into growth mode again. Our first quarter operating ratio increased to 73.4% for the first quarter as the improvements in our direct operating costs did not sufficiently offset the increase in overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Many of our fixed cost categories increased as a percent of revenue during the quarter due to the deleveraging effect associated with the decrease in revenue as well as the timing and significance of certain expenditures. In particular, our depreciation and amortization costs increased 80 basis points and general supplies and expenses increased 30 basis points. Within our direct operating costs, our purchase transportation cost as a percent of revenue improved 140 basis points, while our productive labor cost improved 50 basis points. These changes more than offset the 50 basis point increase in operating supplies and expenses that was primarily due to an increase in our maintenance and repair costs. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $415.4 million for the first quarter and capital expenditures were $234.7 million. We currently anticipate our capital expenditures will be approximately $700 million this year, which is a $100 million decrease from our initial capital expenditure plan. We plan to continue with real estate expansion projects that are already in process and others that we believe will be critical to our long term operating plan. We also plan to continue to purchase new equipment, which we believe will help lower the average age of our fleet and help reduce our maintenance cost per mile. We utilized $141.7 million of cash for our share repurchase program and paid $44.1 million in dividends during the first quarter. Our effective tax rate was 25.8% and 26% for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 respectively. We currently expect our annual effective tax rate to be 25.6% for the second quarter of 2023. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Maybe just a two parter here, one is the uptick in April that didn't materialize. In your conversations with your customers, do you get a sense that this is just a pause while they figure out what's going on with the banking crisis and other things before they resume and their inventory is in a better situation, or do you think the rebound is kind of completely pushed out maybe to '24? And also maybe as a follow-up, can you help us think about kind of fuel surcharge and how we think about that math through the rest of the year? Adam Satterfield : Certainly, it's been difficult to read the tea leaves this year, and we felt like we've had a lot of good conversations with customers and continue to have them. But certainly, it seemed like the whole banking issue was a bit of cold water on the economy overall. I think that it just continues to be a challenging overall and people question in some cases the direction of the economy and continue to be somewhat conservative as a result. But I think our business, we obviously have been talking about probably since the third quarter of last year, an expectation that we would start seeing an uptick, and it didn't happen. Things have stabilized, we continue to be consistent. We continue to have good conversations though. And I would say within our direct business, having conversations with customers, we're seeing an increase in some of these accounts. When I look through our top 50 accounts, business that's not with the 3PL, we're seeing a good increase. We actually saw an increase in revenue with those accounts during the first quarter. Some of our business with 3PLs is suffering a little more. Like we said in our prepared comments, we're seeing some shippers that are prioritizing price over service right now, but you've got a lot of others. And I think that's why we're seeing the increase in our direct business that continue to think strategically about their supply chain, understand the value that we're delivering and know that this environment will turn again. And we helped many of these customers through challenging times and the pandemic and then the supply chain crisis that followed. So I think it's a mixed bag across the board but we continue to stay engaged, we're continuing to have favorable conversations. And it's just a matter of when the economy eventually recovers and we're certainly prepared for when that happens. It's just day in and day out. Our shipments per day have just been pretty consistent, pretty much all through the first quarter, and that's continuing into April. Ravi Shanker : And the fuel surcharge, is there any color that would be great. Adam Satterfield : Certainly, the fuel surcharge, this is the quarter we talked about. It actually happened in March. In March, the average price per gallon was down about 18%. Right now with fuel being $4.10 somewhere in that range, fuel prices are down about 25%. So certainly, we'll see a bigger decrease on a year-over-year basis of fuel surcharges. That's end of the April number that we put out. Already, fuel in April is down about 20%. And so that's driving some of that 15% decrease that we're seeing in our April revenues on a year-over-year basis. But I think the impact is evident in our yield metrics. We're continuing to see good yield increases. As we're going through bids and whatnot, we're continuing to talk about our cost plus increases that are necessary. But when we look at April and kind of where things are, the revenue per hundredweight continues to be solid. And we would expect to see sequential increase in the second quarter over the first quarter. That number should naturally start to trend back closer to what our longer term averages have been from just a core yield increase standpoint, but the revenue per hundredweight with the fuel is reflecting that change now in fuel prices and the fuel surcharge. So that is starting to flatten out, if you will, just like the numbers that we talked about for what we've seen month-to-date for April. Operator : The next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins : So I guess, I'd love to, Adam, get your thoughts on operating ratio progression sequentially. Obviously, this is not a normal second quarter, at least it's not starting off as a normal second quarter in terms of how April is trending. Any way to kind of help us think about the puts and takes in terms of the OR progression first quarter to second quarter relative to normal seasonality? Adam Satterfield : This is certainly -- it's definitely not a usual type of quarter, as you said. I mean, with tonnage being down about 15%, it's been since '09, since we've seen that type of change or maybe back to the second quarter of '20 when the pandemic happened and the world shutdown. But it's something that we've been consistently adjusting to. And frankly, we knew the second quarter comparisons were going to be more challenging this year when we looked through the balance of how the quarters would fall. But the buildup in March that we anticipated obviously didn't happen, that's where you start really getting a lot of that growth, really it happened throughout the first quarter. But March is typically a pretty good increase when you look at things on a shipments per day standpoint that should be up 5% or so. Right now, like I mentioned before, we're seeing shipments per day that's just pretty steady on a day in and day out basis coming in at somewhere around 47,000 shipments per day. And granted the April will have the impact, we don't do half day conventions, but we pretty much have about a half a day loss with the Good Friday and the Easter holidays. But if we don't come off of that number -- and I'll tell you, it's not like we're picking up the same 47,000 shipments day in and day out, we're getting increases with some accounts while others were seeing decreases with. It's not as easy as maybe as what that sounds as it's consistent day in and day out. But if we don't see any further growth from there, we should see it in May, just the natural effect of just like the impact of the holidays, recovering from that, a little bit of growth and if we can move forward from there. But overall, for the quarter, if we're still in this environment where there's no sequential increase then we're looking at revenues that might be flattish in the second quarter with the first as compared to we're normally up about 10% on a per day basis. So if that's the scenario that we're in then I think that we're looking at an operating ratio that may be more consistent with the first quarter and could see some slight deterioration from there. I think our challenge will continue to be managing our direct variable cost, that's a productive labor, our operating supplies and expenses and so forth. If we're in the same type of shipments per day environment, managing those costs flat, maybe with some slight improvement as a percent of revenue, those were about 54% of revenue in the first quarter. And then from an overhead standpoint, those costs were about 19.5% in the first quarter. We'll continue to have an increase in the aggregate amount of depreciation expenses and some other dollars of overhead that might increase. So those costs could increase further as a percent of revenue from that 19.5%. But for us, it's certainly challenging. But I can tell you our teams were looking at costs, were looking at productivity, were looking at the size of the fleet and making adjustments on a day by day basis trying to get in and save costs where we can. But like we mentioned before, doing all the right things that position us to come out of this downturn even stronger. And that's when the inflection when it happens when we really outperform for the longest time when we get into these slower macro periods, our market share is generally flatter as we maintain our price discipline. But then when we come out, that's when we really see the outperformance in our volumes versus the industry. So we're going to continue to -- with the same strategic plan that's got us to where we are today and I think that we'll emerge from this thing even stronger. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : One thing I just want to clarify and then I have my actual question. So Adam, your comment about OR may be flattish 1Q to 2Q, is that -- that's assuming that there's none of the seasonal May and June uptick. Is that -- am I understanding that right? Adam Satterfield : Well, assuming a little bit just the natural uptick that would happen in the sense of our May volumes should be somewhere -- I mean, where we are today, if they stay at this 47,000 range, it'd be a slight uptick over April just because of April being impacted by that half day that I mentioned for the Good Friday and Easter holidays. But you're correct. Just assuming that we stay in this sort of malaise where we don't see any incremental uptick and frankly, no decline either, but just staying in this flattish on a sequential basis, we certainly hope that there will be an uptick in volumes. We've seen some good trends, good couple of days this week. But I think that we certainly need to be mindful of kind of where we are and the fact that we don't see that positive inflection from an economic standpoint happening. And so I think we do need to talk about kind of where we are today. Obviously, we give our mid-quarter update. So if the inflection happens and we start seeing some growth, we're certainly ready and can handle it. And that's when we can start maybe talking about seeing some incremental improvement, if you will, relative to the first quarter. But right now, it's just things on a day in, day out basis are -- have just been very steady as she goes from a revenue per day and a shipments per day standpoint. Scott Group : And then when you talk about volume down the most since '09, I guess I just want to understand like the pricing is holding up for you really, really well. At what point does that get tougher, are you seeing any signs of competitive pressure, just given the market continuing to get worse right now from a volume standpoint? Adam Satterfield : Yes, I mean it's certainly -- one, I think the comparison is a little bit tougher and that should get better as we progress through this year, even if our numbers were to stay flatter, the numbers should start to show a little bit of improvement. But it's still a really soft environment out there. And I think that we've demonstrated a lot of value and that's what we continue to talk about with our customers. And our costs continue to go up and we need increases. We've invested a lot in our network over the years, over the last 10 years, about $4.5 billion of capital expenditures to grow our service center network, to be and have capacity where our customers need us and to have the right fleet and the right team to be able to continue to deliver value to our customers. So we've invested a lot and we intend to continue to invest. So I think that, that doesn't change the conversations that we're having with shippers. But in some cases due to the economy and due to internal pressures, there are some shippers that got to look for cheaper price carriers. And we're a premium carrier, premium service and our price is generally a little bit higher than others. And so oftentimes we'll hear feedback though from shippers that are making that short term decision that they're doing it to meet internal thresholds and intend to give the volume back to us. Like I mentioned, we're seeing a little bit more transactional volume loss within our 3PL book of business right now, that's about a third of our overall revenue in the first quarter. 3PLs were down a little worse than the company average revenue change. So that's something that would continue to be mindful of. And that too often flips and kind of ebbs and flows with the economy. But I think for us, it's just got have a plan, and we have one and stay disciplined to it and just keep our focus on delivering service. That comes at a cost. There becomes a fixed element of running our linehaul network and our P&D system to be able to continue to deliver service. And usually, this is when service breakdown occurs in the industry. When you become very focused on mitigating cost and I think we're in a much stronger position than every other carrier. But when you start focusing on trying to mitigate cost in this type of environment when the other carriers have seen worse volume loss than us on average, that's when trailers start getting hailed longer to try to fill them up and on-time service starts declining, claims start increasing, other bad things happen, that really, I think, or at least what we've seen in the past, we see a widening of the gap from a service performance on us versus the industry. So we expect that will play out again. And when the economy starts recovering, it's obviously tough to manage through it on a day-by-day basis. But I think we get right back to our market share gains. I don't think anything has changed in the sense of what we think our long term market share potential can be, what our long term operating ratio goals are. None of that really changes. It just kind of news when the start point begins when we get back into market share growth mode again. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Jon Chappell : Marty, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, and Adam, you've kind of addressed it in a couple of your answers as well. But customers choosing price over service, have you seen any kind of significant cracks in the pricing dynamic, given just the complete weakness in the volume side? And how would you compare kind of the pricing environment today versus other periods of recessionary volume backdrop? Greg Gantt : I've been through this a few times in my 40 years in transportation. And I think the worst I've ever seen was 2009 and we're nowhere near that. But there is some challenging pricing out there as there always is during low freight levels. Most of it we see is transactional mom-and-pop type shippers and inbound customers. So yes, it can be challenging out there but it's not anything we haven't seen before and it's not anything we can't work through and manage through. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Tom Wadewitz : I think I said this on the last call maybe, but if I didn't, congratulations, Greg, on the retirement and the great run you had. I actually want to ask along those lines, I guess, you've seen -- you're retiring, someone on the teams moved to a competitor, there's some degree of change going on, that will take place with the OD team. How do you think that may affect what you're doing at OD, what might be some of the risks around that? Are there risks around that, are there potential things that you say, well, this was my approach obviously tremendously successful, but the next person might tweak things a bit. So I know that's kind of anticipatory. But just thoughts on some of the management things that are -- have taken place or will take place as you retire? Greg Gantt : I don't mind addressing that at all. I appreciate the question. But fortunately, Tom, we've got a tremendously strong team here at OD. The folks replacing me have merely as many years in some cases in the industry as I do. They are all 20 plus year veterans, they've been through everything since we started executing this plan many years ago. They've been through the thick and thin and the good times, the bad times, and they know who we are and they know what's made us successful. They understand our plan going forward. And I think we're in a great position to continue to execute on that plan. So Tom, there's always risk. Anytime you lose good people, certainly, there's risk. But I feel extremely good about where we are. We'll make the replacement and continue to move forward. Again, thankfully, we had a plan, a plan to execute on my exit, if you will, and promoted the folks that certainly are capable of continuing to drive our results forward. So again, I feel good about it. I'm not concerned about that far at all. These guys know what to do and, hey, I feel extremely good about it. We got a great team. You can see that in the results. It's not me, it's not just the folks here. But I think everybody truly understands what we're trying to do and how we're supposed to execute and handle customers' business on a daily basis, and that's not going to change just because I'm out the door or any other one person left. Those fundamental things that we know how to do much better than our competitors, that's not going to change any time soon. So I think the basics of blocking and tackling those kind of things without any doubt, we're far superior to all of our competitors, again, that's not going to change. So I think we're in a good spot. And hey, I look forward to a whole lot of success down the road for OD. Operator : The next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Allison Poliniak : Just let me go back to the comment on the top of the accounts. You did say there were actually some that were improving here. I guess any color that we can maybe read through in vertical or such that that's driving some of that improvement? And I guess, along with that, that stabilization when you kind of think of those larger customers, do you at least -- I know we don't have a view on the inflection, but at least the stabilization may hold? Just any color there. Adam Satterfield : It was pretty consistent performance between our retail and industrial customer base during the quarter. The revenue levels were generally about the same for both. But like I mentioned earlier, it's really a lot of the business that we're seeing, there's probably a little bit worse decline with business that's managed by 3PLs. And so that's fairly typical in a softer environment, if you will, and so not wholly unexpected completely. But yes, we've seen just a consistency day in and day out with business levels in terms of the number of shipments per day that we've seen, it's been trending around 47,000 bills a day and we don't necessarily see that inflection point, if you will, happening. Typically, you would start seeing an increase, you'd see an increase in May of about 2.5% to 3% and then a further increase from May to June of 2%. And certainly, we'd like to think that that might happen. But if you go back to when things really started decreasing, it was last year in April. March of last year was the last month where we had a nice sequential increase. Our business in February of last year was up about 5%. It was up another 3% in March. But then we started dropping off and basically have been flat to down for every month thereafter. And our shipments have been pretty consistent, they've increased very, very slightly, less than 1% each month. So pretty much consistent as we made our way through each month of the first quarter, pretty much had been the same in April, again, other than those two days that we consider full days impacted by the holiday, but that's in our normal number. Typically, April would be up about 0.5% over March. And right now, we're down about 2.5% shipments per day. So that's some of that where we've just seen that consistent trend day in and day out. So do we start seeing some increase? Like I mentioned before, May just naturally should show a little bit of growth if we stay at this 47,000 bill level. And do we start growing from there? Do we see 1% or growth in June? I'd like to think that we would. And again, we've had a lot of good conversations. We've had some good hits here lately with customers. But some of those same conversations we were having three months ago where we were positive as well. So I think that right now, we just want to be conservative, if you will, and we're continuing to try to manage our costs down to this lower level of shipments. And I think that will continue to happen as we progress through the years. We focus on productivity. We're a little heavy with our fleet now as well and we're working through some of those challenges. But just trying to get everything balanced as best as we can while we stay in this sort of stable period, if you will. But it's just not really seeing any kind of growth. But I'd say typically, April volumes from a shipments per day standpoint typically are fairly consistent with what our year-to-date average is, and we've seen that over time other than in 2020. And so that's something that we just sort of keep in mind from a planning standpoint. And we always have a plan for -- we have a baseline plan, we've talked about this before that we enter every year with and then we have a bull scenario and a bear scenario. And '21 was more at that bull case scenario and this year is more in the bear. So we start with a plan, if things materialize like this, and that's about at the level where we are and we're executing on that plan. Operator : The next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Quick question. When was the last time shipments in 2Q were worse than 1Q? I don't know or I don't think there's ever been a time that that's been the case. But if you can just help me with that? And then when does the drawdown on weights abate, we're at 1,550 now. Are we at the point where we stabilize at these levels? So those two points. And then Adam, historically, you've lost lanes in past downturns to high quality regional players or maybe lower cost. I don't think that's happened maybe up until now. I don't know if that's happening now that maybe explain some of the weakness in April. But if you can talk about kind of what the customers are doing from a trade down effect to some of the regional, maybe equally or as high quality players? Adam Satterfield : From a second quarter to first quarter standpoint, other than the second quarter of '20 when the world shutdown, we've not really seen a decrease in shipments. And that too kind of played into our general thinking, even years like 2009, 2016, 2019, weaker years, we still had some marginal improvement in shipments in the second quarter versus the first. And so right now, that's kind of trending flattish. We'll see how things shake out for the remainder of the period. And like I said, maybe we'll get some growth. And certainly, it will be out there as we put our mid quarter update, we'll put the final April update in our 10-Q. And if we see some continued acceleration this week that will be in the number, but we just don't see a big inflection point happening like we did in, say, 2017 that spurred that growth of '17 through '18 and what we saw in the back part of 2020 that continue to accelerate through '21 like it happened. And so we're still waiting for that point but we don't see it kind of on the near term. And so we just managed to kind of where we are. But yes, that's kind of the challenge in what we're seeing. It's partly why I mentioned earlier that our revenues in the second quarter are typically up 9%, 10% and that's why we always get so much margin improvement in the second quarter as well. And so that becomes the challenge as we manage through this particular period. But with respect to your other question on the customer base, I don't know that we're seeing significant loss other than that's some of what's going on underneath, I think, with some of the 3PL business, that they can leverage their carrier relationships and move some freight, and some of this is transactional as well. But they can take advantage of relationships and see who has capacity and who's got a cheaper price and move some business away. But that's some of the feedback where we've heard customers coming to us and saying, look, I need to do this to meet my own call center objectives, if there's an internal mandate to save X dollars that they've got to try to meet in some way. But generally speaking, that freight comes back to us. If we ever lose freight, it's on price, but we generally always gain it back for service quality and capacity down the road. So we're confident that -- but that trend will continue to play out again and that we'll see any of this freight loss eventually come back to us. It's just a matter of -- it seems like that's being pushed further down the road than the inflection point that we thought would happen beginning with this spring. Amit Mehrotra : What about weight? Adam Satterfield : Yes, weight per shipment. I guess you've embedded three questions in one, but -- and my memory was short. Yes, our weight per shipment, it's down a little bit further. I think we're getting to the stabilization point. Right now in April, it's about 1,525 pounds. Historically, we would get down in lower periods to about 1,550 pounds or so. But if you recall, we made some strategic decisions in '21 and exited from some of the spot heavier type shipments, these 8,000, 10,000 pound type loads and that had an effect of really lowering our overall weight per shipment. So despite the weakness, we're not going back and trying to bring in freight that we didn't think fit our network for the long term. So just going along with the economy, we've seen a little further deceleration and that weight per shipment being down to 1,525 pounds. So that's a little bit worse. April is always usually down 0.5% or 1% off of March. Some of that is March builds up at the end of the quarter, but we're down a little bit more. But I feel like that's stabilizing that probably our low watermark in a softer economy will be 1,525, 1,530 pounds maybe. But yes, we think that's getting to a stabilization point or so it seems. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Chris Wetherbee : Adam, just kind of curious how you think about headcount going forward here? Obviously, a lack of seasonality might influence this, but you've been bringing it down sequentially the last few quarters. Just want to get a sense maybe how much more room you have in terms of rightsizing that labor force? And maybe is there a line where you feel like you don't necessarily want to go beyond? Adam Satterfield : Yes, it's continued to drift lower on a sequential basis. The average was down about 3.5% in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. But our peak, if you will, for full time headcount was in May of last year. And through normal attrition and just some places making other decisions, if you will, just balancing our number of employees with the freight volumes that exist, we've had to work through those on a case-by-case basis throughout our 255 locations. But I expect that, that will continue to drift a little bit lower as attrition continues to happen from where we are today through the end of June. And we're getting to a point, I think, that if you kind of compare where we are, if we continue to drift maybe 1% or 2% lower as we progress through the second quarter to where the year-over-year change by the end of June maybe in that 9% to 10% type of range, and then that's coming back into balance. We've always talked about the change in headcount typically reconciles with the overall change in shipment count as well. And so you know if we're looking at that, I think by the end of June, that change in shipments on a month-over-month basis, those two numbers may start coming back into payer team with one another. That is the change in full time employees and the change in our shipments on a year-over-year basis. Operator : The next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Bascome Majors : You've been pretty open about some of the share and pricing challenges with 3PL business. Can you walk us through a little bit on how that emerges. Are you seeing larger carriers reduce their rates across the board with 3PLs and losing business that way, or is this more targeted dynamic pricing? And just if that cyclical dynamic, which I'm sure has been around before, if that is evolving any differently this cycle than last cycle, we'd love to hear more about it? Adam Satterfield : Yes, I think it's hard for us to say. We don't always know the reasons behind. I mean the feedback we get is that someone's cheaper. We don't know necessarily that variance or that reason why. I think that we're obviously one of the first carriers to report and just continue to watch what the others are doing, what their numbers are looking like and hear what the others have to say, I think. Others have said that they've got price discipline but we've seen one carrier's yield flatten out. So I think all we can do is just continue to sort of watch and and see what others are doing, but that doesn't impact what we do. We've got a plan, we stay committed to it, and we know what value we deliver and we just got to stay disciplined, and that's what we'll do. So it's never good to kind of live through it in a moment and we've done this time and time again. But like I said, it's not totally unexpected to see some of that business just given the softness in the economic environment and cost challenges that people are facing in general to be looking at ways they might be able to save on price in the current term. But what we always say is price doesn't equal cost. We deliver value to our customers. And when you consider total cost of transportation, when you deliver 99% on time and have a claims ratio of 0.1% and you save money by shipping with Old Dominion and that's what our position continues to be, demonstrate value. We\u2019ve got to continue to maintain our service metrics, and we will, that is certainly a focus for us, and we'll manage through this. But like we said before and I think it's played out when you look at our numbers and the long term improvement that we've made with respect to our margins and the cash from operations that we generate and are able to reinvest back in our business on behalf of our customers, we've got to maintain our disciplined approach. And I think that it's proven itself out in the long run and is a key difference why our numbers look a lot different from some of the others. Bascome Majors : But when you look back to 2019 or 2016, does the rising competitiveness on price and share of the 3PL channel feel different this time? Just curious if this all rhymes or something feels like it's changed here? Adam Satterfield : No I wouldn't say it\u2026 Greg Gantt : It's maybe a little bit different basket, but not wholly and completely. And just to add a little color to what Adam said, generally speaking with our 3PLs, we're not losing contractual business. Some of those contractual accounts maybe down just because the general economy is slower, they may possibly be down but that's not where we're losing. And the transactional stuff, as Adam talked about before, that's where we're seeing a deterioration in our revenue with those specific 3PLs. They all have a large piece of business that's transactional, that customers may ship once twice whatever a week, smaller type accounts and that's where we're seeing the losses from our standpoint. So it's just business that they can price on the fly. And we're never going to be the low cost guy on the fly, if you will. So anyway, that's more of what we've seen. It's not losing business by any stretch. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Ken Hoexter : Greg, good luck in retirement and maybe [West] might be giving you a call soon\u2026 Greg Gantt : I'm not sure that with me being on this board and that one\u2026 Ken Hoexter : Marty, I just want to clarify, I just want to make sure I heard you right. Did you say this is not abnormal in terms of the part of the cycle on pricing? And then my question for Adam or Greg, I guess, is just the ability to be fluid on cost, right? So you've always talked about more so than peers given the fixed cost structure of the less than truckload market, and OD is focused on keeping people. How do you shift -- how do you think about shifting costs or what moves you make now with volumes down 15%? I know you always want to be prepared and have the 25% capacity available, but what do you think about on the cost and impact OR? Greg Gantt : This is not abnormal in this type of environment, economic environment. You have -- some of our competitors, they think offering a more competitive or lower price will keep the customer there. Many times, it does not because the customer will always come back to having their cargo delivered on time and claim free. We've learned that over the years. So it's not abnormal. We choose to tighten our belt and manage our labor. And when the slow times pass, we're in a great position to keep our OR going downwards though. But it's not abnormal to see low prices in any environment with any company. So we've seen it before and it will pass like it always does. And Adam, I'll let you handle the\u2026 Adam Satterfield : I would only say on the call standpoint, I mean, obviously, we've switched to where our variable costs or the majority of our cost base now, probably 70% or more of our costs now are variable in nature. And obviously, we've got a big fixed cost base and we're seeing the loss leverage with the revenue decline there driving some of that. But some of the increase in those overhead costs in the first quarter also comes from the fact that we're on a little bit of a different schedule with respect to our equipment plan. We were taking delivery in the fourth quarter of equipment, taken delivery in the first quarter, which is unusual and that was part of why we had anticipated a sequential increase in those depreciation costs as a percent of revenue. But given all the challenges from a fleet standpoint, that's driving some of our costs. It's also driving some of the maintenance and repair costs, like I mentioned. We're seeing an increase in cost per mile. Some of that is just due to general inflation related to parts and repairs. But some of it, too, just relates to the fact that we're bringing in equipment. We've -- on a different schedule, we've held equipment through '21 and '22 and our average fleet age has increased as a result. We're -- probably our average fleet age is about five and half years now, we like it to be around four years. And so we'll work on balancing that as we take out some of the older equipment from the fleet and adjusting our fleet, if you will, to the lower shipment levels and that will help from a cost and an efficiency standpoint. But 80% of our costs are salaries, wages and benefits and ops supplies and expenses. And linehaul is a big element underneath that. And so that's why we've got to stay disciplined. We mentioned in our prepared comments about our linehaul load factor being down like it is. I can tell you that's a focus, that's a lot of dollars, not only from a labor standpoint, but that's what creates the miles that we run. And so that's -- we can drive some improvement there, that will help us from both labor and fuel, in particular, while we're also making some adjustments on the fleet that will help with both depreciation and maintenance costs. But like I think I said earlier, there's an element that becomes fixed -- about every variable cost is fixed in the short run. And if we want to continue to deliver service and we are, there becomes a fixed element within that linehaul component. And so we've got to be able to do both, frankly. We're not going to lose our focus on giving service but we've got some room for improvement. And that's what our team talks about every week and frankly, every day out in the field is where we can drive some efficiency. That's going to be the biggest self help area. It always has been. And that's the work that we've got cut out for us as we go through the last three quarters of this year. I think I've said before that when we look at our direct operating costs, these variable cost, productive labor and ops, supplies and expenses and so forth, even in slower periods in the past, even in 2009, we were able to generate some improvement in those costs as a percent of revenue on a year-over-year basis. And so the operating loss in '09 being with our fixed overhead cost, and so that's the challenge that continues to be in front of us. And in the second quarter, I mentioned, if we can keep those costs at 54%, they were about 53% in the second quarter of last year. So we're going to have a little bit of headwind there but we've got to continue to work those costs down as we progress through the year and that will be the operating challenge that we face. Operator : The last question today will come from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Bruce Chan : I just want to come at the volume question from a little bit of a different angle. You've had some competitors that were going through some labor negotiations this year. One is going through a pretty significant change of ops. Do you see any volume coming into the network because of -- or maybe in anticipation of those events? And then, Adam, maybe just a quick housekeeping question, you gave us some good color on the fleet age. How long do you think it's going to be before you're back at that sort of target four years? Adam Satterfield : I would say that we should make a lot of progress this year. We've got a fair amount of equipment right now that we've got identified that we want to be able to move out of the system, but that takes a fair amount of time to happen. It's not just an overnight thing where you're selling a used car and you posted on a Web site. So it's going to take us a little bit of time to kind of work through that, but we've got a plan. We've met several times recently talking about kind of the needs there and we'll continue to work through it. So I think that we'll make considerable progress this year as we're still bringing on -- we reduced our CapEx for equipment. But we're still going to be bringing on a fair number of new units and more of the progress will be hanging -- or getting rid of some of these older units that we've been hanging on to. And I'll say we're not out of the woods yet when it comes to parts availability and so forth. We're still finding that there are continuing to be supply chain issues out there. And when we've got equipment that has been down for maintenance, equipment has stayed down for longer periods of time. So we're continuing to kind of manage through those challenges while we're also trying to manage cost. But I think we'll end up by the end of this year making pretty steady progress on working that number much lower than where it was at the end of last year, kind of working both ends of the spectrum, if you will. Bruce Chan : And then just on the volume side, any discernible share wins from any of those union competitors? Greg Gantt : It's kind of hard to say, Bruce. We get reports from our national account folks on a regular basis. And we have wins on business from those folks as well as others. So I don't know that you can really point to contract negotiations or whatever the case as any reason that we're getting business. We haven't really seen that. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg C. Gantt for any closing remarks. Greg Gantt : Well, thanks, everybody, for your participation today. We appreciate your questions. Feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. I hope you have a great day. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you for your cooperation.  At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Marty Freeman. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Freeman : Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. And after some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. The OD team delivered solid financial results for the second quarter, considering the operating challenges associated with the continued softness in the domestic economy and a decrease in our volumes.  With a 15.2% decrease in revenue during the quarter, our team was focused on improving our yield, managing our variable costs and controlling our discretionary spending. As a result, we were pleased to produce a 72.3% operating ratio and earnings per diluted share of $2.65. We achieved these results by continuing to execute our long-term strategic plans which has guided us for many years throughout many economic cycles. The plan is centered on our ability to deliver superior service at a fair price, which included on-time service performance of 99% and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1% during that second quarter.  Providing this level of superior service strengthens both our value proposition and our relationships with our customers. Delivering superior service also supports our ongoing yield management initiatives. We have improved the quality of our revenue over long term by offering a consistent approach to pricing, which is designed to offset our cost inflation and support our ongoing investments in service center capacity and technology. We believe that our ability to consistently offer network capacity differentiates us from the others in our industry, which is an additional element of our value proposition that we believe will support our long-term market share initiatives.  Our market share remained relatively consistent during the second quarter despite an environment where overall freight demand was subdued. The year-over-year decrease in our volumes, however, resulted in a loss of operating density. We believe that our long-term improvement in our operating ratio requires consistent increases in both density and yield, both of which generally require a favorable macroeconomic environment. With our commitment to providing superior service as our first priority for our customers, it becomes a challenge to maintain much, less improve, our productivity during the periods with reduced density. As evidence of this fact, our linehaul latent load factor decreased 3.1% during the second quarter. We were pleased, however, that our platform shipments per hour increased 6.6% and P&D shipments per hour increased 0.5%. These improvements as well as other efforts by our team to manage cost helped us maintain our direct operating cost as a percent of revenue.  Our overhead costs, on the other hand, increased as a percent of revenue during the quarter, as most of these cost categories are fixed. We also believe an increase in aggregate depreciation expense due to the ongoing execution of our capital expenditure plan. We believe it is critically important to continue to execute on this plan regardless of the short-term economic outlook. We currently have approximately 30% excess capacity within our service center network, which is a little higher than our target range of 25%. We are comfortable with the amount of excess capacity as we remain confident in our ability to win market share over the long term. Finding land and building service centers in the right locations can take considerable time. Therefore, we make every effort to stay ahead of our growth curve with these investments. We could not have doubled our market share over the past 10 years without our consistent investment in service center capacity as well as our regular investments in our fleet, our technology and training, education and benefits for our OD family of employees.  Our proactive approach to managing all elements of capacity has created a strategic advantage for us in the marketplace, which typically becomes most apparent to shippers in tight capacity environments. We do not always know when an inflection point in the demand environment is going to occur, but we believe we are well positioned to respond to any acceleration in volumes when it happens.  Through the disciplined execution of our long-term strategic plan, our team has created one of the strongest records for long-term growth and profitability in the LTL industry. We remain committed to providing superior service at a fair price and maintaining the necessary capacity to support growth, and we believe we are better positioned than any other carrier to produce long-term profitable growth while increasing shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Marty, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue results for the second quarter reflect a 14.1% decrease in LTL tons per day and 1.1% decrease in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Our yield metrics were affected by the significant decrease in the price of diesel fuel during the quarter as LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 7.6% reflecting our consistent approach to managing yield.  On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the second quarter decreased 2.0% when compared to the first quarter 2023, with LTL tons per day decreasing 1.8% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 0.3%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes an increase of 9.8% in revenue per day, an increase of 6.8% in tons per day and an increase of 7.2% in shipments per day.  Our shipments per day on average have been relatively consistent since December of last year. We had previously communicated our expectation for volumes to remain consistent through the second quarter despite the sequential growth that we have historically achieved in this period. Our baseline thinking was for volumes to remain consistent through the third quarter as well, although we have noticed an incremental increase in revenue over the past few workdays.  The change in our revenue on a week-by-week basis so far in July has been relatively consistent with historical averages. As a result, it appears that sequential change in both revenue and shipments per day for July will be the first time this year where we're more closely aligned with our 10-year average sequential change.  While there are still a few work days remaining in July, our revenue per day has decreased by approximately 15% to 16% when compared to July 2022, although the timing of the July 4 holiday has skewed this number slightly. If the trend that we've seen over the past few workdays hold steady through the end of the month, we expect  [Technical Difficulty] price of diesel fuel and our purchase transportation cost improved 60 basis points. These changes more than offset the increase in salaries, wages and benefits as a percent of revenue for our drivers, platform employees and fleet technicians that are included in our direct costs.  Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $287.8 million and $703.2 million for the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively, while capital expenditures were $244.7 million and $479.4 million for those same periods. We utilized $160.5 million and $302.2 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively, while cash dividends totaled $43.8 million and $87.8 million for the same period.  We announced this morning that our Board has approved a new share repurchase program that provides us with the authorization to repurchase up to $3 billion of our outstanding stock. This program will begin after the completion of our existing $2 billion repurchase program that was announced in July 2021. While we intend to continue our focus of returning excess capital to our shareholders, our first priority for capital spending will continue to be the strategic investments in capital expenditures that support the long-term profitable growth of our business.  Our effective tax rate was 25.4% and 26.0% for the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. We currently expect our annual effective tax rate to be 25.6% for the third quarter of 2023.  This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we're happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Jordan Alliger : Obviously, there's a lot of noise in the background now with one of the major competitors out there. Can you maybe touch a little bit on what, if anything, you're seeing or expecting either from a diversion -- I guess from a diversion perspective now? Adam Satterfield : Sure. Yes, we don't want to make any comments specifically on 1 carrier or another. But like I mentioned, we have seen an uptick in business over the past few days, in particular. But really, I think that over the past few weeks, we have started to start seeing a little bit better trend, if you will, and it goes back to maybe beyond that. I think we're at the end of a long, slow cycle.  And we've stayed in front of our customers over the last 1 year, 1.5 years as things have been slower, I guess really going back to April of last year. And typically, when we get to the end of this kind of cycle, we start hearing comments about service issues with other carriers and the need for shippers to start reusing Old Dominion within their supply chain.  And so we've started increasingly having those types of conversations and certainly, some of that has intensified here over the last few weeks. But when we look at things, we look at our success measured over the period of years over the long term is the way that we continue to try to manage our business and we doubled our market share over the last 10 years and I think when we think about the next 10 years of opportunity, we've got a long runway for growth ahead and we want to keep winning market share in the right way for us. So we'll continue to stay in front of customers for sure and talk about the Old Dominion value proposition and how we can deliver value to their supply chain. So it has driven a little incremental increase. We had been running at about 47,000 shipments a day. We talked a lot about that on last earnings call last quarter. And we typically see a little bit of an increase in waste from beginning of the month to the end of the month. But we've been, the last few days, running closer to 50,000 shipments a day.  It's hard to say one factor versus another what's driving that higher, but it has been a little bit higher than what I had initially forecast probably a month ago. So maybe it's picked up at this point a 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 shipments per day, more so than what we had initially been forecasting for. But I would expect that we feel like we're getting towards the end of the slow cycle and would expect to start seeing business levels start to return to us at the end of the year and certainly as we get into the early part of 2024, it feels like underlying demand -- takes supply in the industry out of the equation, but it feels like demand is starting to improve a little bit and we're having good conversations with customers just like we've been having all year long. But yes, certainly, it feels like things are starting to turn a little bit. Jordan Alliger : If I could just ask a follow-up? I think you had mentioned you have about 30% excess capacity in your network now, whether it be demand or competitor problems. I think you also said normally, you like about 25%, but would you push that excess capacity lower? I mean would you be at -- would you run with just 20% or 15% excess capacity or is it a relatively firm line? Adam Satterfield : Yes. Certainly, that 25% is just a target. And we go through periods where, when you look at the system, on average, it's been below that. 2021 is a good example where we had significant sequential growth that year due to the strength of the economy. And we look and you look back at our trend, we were 1 or 2 carriers that had a double-digit sequential increase, at least public carriers from the first to the second quarter 2021 and then we were the only carrier that followed that up with another increase -- sequential increase from the second to the third quarter.  So we've proven in the past that if you've got the right strategies that we can take on business and pretty significant increases in business because of the way that we try to plan for the long term and build capacity into the system. And certainly, you've always got to be thinking -- in our case, we try to think several years ahead and stay ahead of our growth curve. But that -- the service center capacity is one element of the overall capacity equation. There's still the people component of it and the equipment piece as well. But we try to stay further ahead of the curve with service centers.  In certain markets, we try to stay even further ahead, if you will. But that's always a number that flexes up and down and each service center is different. We've got some service centers that got more capacity than others and -- but that's generally about where we try to stay just from an overall system average. Operator : And our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. James Monigan : James Monigan on for Allison. Just wanted to ask about sort of how we should think about OR in the third quarter? Like you're getting some volume, better pricing trends, presumably as well, how should we think about sort of the potential improvement? And should we essentially see sort of something maybe even above seasonality given the latent operating leverage? Adam Satterfield : Well, I think the top line is going to be the determining factor here. And when it comes to the top line, obviously, we've shared a little bit about where we are with July, and we'll continue to give our mid-quarter update. So August will be out there as well.  But from a baseline standpoint, what I usually was thinking and I may try to address this in a slightly different manner than what we have in the past. Typically, we see about a 50 basis point increase in the operating ratio from the second to the third quarter.  And I would expect this third quarter we are going to have some increase in some of our -- from an aggregate dollar standpoint in some of the overhead categories. I feel like our total overhead expenses are going to -- the dollars wise are going to be higher than where we were. Some of that will be depreciation. We expect our miscellanies expenses to be a bit higher in our general supplies and expenses as well. So it will depend on where that top line comes in. I think that we can manage -- continue to manage our direct operating costs, which are more variable in nature consistent as a percent of revenue. And so we would look to try to keep those costs consistent with where we were last year. And that would be a slight improvement, but fairly constant with where we were in the second quarter.  And then it just becomes the leverage that we get on the overhead. So if we've got some dollars higher, if the top line, if the volume environment were to stay flatter like what our base case scenario previously was, then obviously, we would lose a little bit more leverage there. But if we get some incremental improvement and further growth from where we are now, I think that's going to be really the slide, if you will, in terms of where the OR might end up that baseline thinking because of the increase in overhead expenses, I was thinking that we would be slightly worse than the normal seasonality, somewhere between 50 to 100 basis points of an increase over what we just did in the second quarter.  So a lot is just going to depend on how those overhead costs as a percent of revenue move around really dependent on what the top line is doing. Operator : And the next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins : Okay. Great. I guess I'd like to ask a question on the pricing environment. And I guess, more specifically, if you go back 3 months ago, there was -- it seemed like there was incremental competition around some of the transactional freight in the marketplace. Have you seen anything change there, whether it's over the course of the last few months or in recent weeks that would give you some more confidence about the trajectory of pricing in the marketplace? Just any sort of commentary on that, I think, would be helpful. Kevin Freeman : Yes. There has been no major changes in the pricing environment. I mean we're still getting increases from our contract carriers and there's not anything really crazy going on out there, so -- which is a pleasant surprise in a slower environment. But Again, we're not seeing any changes from the first quarter, and we're still getting increases when we need them. Jack Atkins : But I guess just a quick follow-up on that, Marty, if I could. I mean are you seeing maybe just given all the shifting dynamics in the marketplace, maybe a little bit less of a competitive situation going on with the transactional part of the market? Are you seeing some firming in pricing there, I guess, was what I was trying to get at? Kevin Freeman : Yes, I haven't really seen any changes at all whatsoever from a transactional basis. But it's just -- I mean if we need it -- as you know, as I've said before on the last call, we're a cost-plus costing model, that's what we base our pricing on and when we go in to discuss pricing, we basically show our customer what our cost is and they understand why we need to increase. We're not having any issues getting it. But no, I'm not seeing any crazy pricing adjustments out there since the first quarter. Operator : And our next question comes from Jonathan Chappell of Evercore ISI. Jonathan Chappell : Sticking with that transactional theme. Adam, last quarter, you kind of flagged the 3PL business losses as being a bit more outsized. Has that basically run its course where there's not much more 3PL business to lose? And as you talked about this kind of recent uptick in the last few work days, has that been more kind of transactional volume as well, maybe getting some of that 3PL back? Or are you actually seeing core LTL freight pick up substantially over the last week or so? Adam Satterfield : Yes, it's more of the core. And I would say, looking through our top 50 customers, the 3PL piece of the business really just performed in line with the company average really in the second quarter. We still had better performance with our core contract business, those that have direct contracts with us. But with revenue down 15%, everyone was pretty much down. A lot of that, obviously, there's a big decrease in fuel surcharge revenue that had an impact on the second quarter with the average price of fuel being down close to 30%. So that was certainly a headwind that we had to contend with. But that's -- we go back to -- we've had consistent conversations with customers really over the last year. And I think we've been pleased with the trends that we've seen. And certainly, we'd rather be talking about growth and see pure growth going on. So it's been tough to kind of go through the last year or so.  But I think that we've had good customer relationships. We've got long-term customer relationships, people that have gone through supply chain challenges realize the value of Old Dominion and are continuing to increase their business with us. And the demand environment overall with the state of the domestic economy and that has certainly had an impact on our customers' businesses as well.  And so in many accounts that we've kept the contracts have been awarded the same types of customers may just not have the same amount of business that they've had before. And that's kind of what I was alluding to earlier, where I feel like we're getting to the end of that kind of process where it feels like we're seeing stabilization and I go back to just underlying demand for LTL transportation, I felt like things were kind of getting to the point where we were seeing stabilization.  We've had stable trends all year. But I felt like we were getting back to the point where we might start to see our market share -- it's been relatively consistent this year. It's been down slightly, but I felt like we were kind of getting to that end to where things are going to start turning back in our favor.  And some of that just goes to some of the conversations we've had about others in the industry. We're hearing more service failures, and that's generally when the business starts coming back to us. So I feel good about kind of those underlying trends and getting through the back half of this year and being ready for 2024. Operator : And the next question comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Christian Wetherbee : Maybe I wanted to come back to pricing for a minute, maybe kind of big picture, if we think about the potential for capacity event in the industry where we see capacity materially tighten. I think we've looked at these in the past, we've seen meaningful pricing opportunities for the carriers in the space. I guess conceptually, how do you think about that? If we were to see some degree of capacity event, given the strength in pricing over this last cycle, is there still material upside as you think about that? I know volume ultimately will come back, but I wanted to get a sense of what you think about the potential future pricing opportunities are as capacity potentially gets tighter in the industry? Adam Satterfield : Well, I think for us, it's all about having a consistent process, and we talk about that a lot. We're trying to have, as Marty mentioned earlier, we have a cost-based process. And we talk about our cost inflation with customers and the need to have a price increase that it's 100 to 150 basis points above our cost inflation every year to support the significant investments that we're making in service center capacity and technologies.  And so I think that's generally understood and it kind of makes sense if you sit across the table and had that conversation. Obviously, a lot goes into that for us managing our cost and trying to keep cost inflation in check, and I was pleased that we're starting to see some of the cost per shipment numbers, they're moderating. If you take fuel out of the equation, just our core price inflation is starting to trend back to closer to what our expectations were for this year. So I feel like our team has done a phenomenal job with managing our cost and keeping that inflation in check as best we can in a low volume environment. I mean to produce a 7 2 3 in the second quarter with a 14% decrease in tonnage is pretty remarkable in my opinion.  But I think that we just got to stay consistent with our approach. And I think other carriers, they start making similar to what was going on in 2021. If other carriers are closing the pricing gap and are trying to use the environment to take even bigger increases, then I think that bodes well for our market share opportunities. We're typically a little bit more expensive than the other carriers on average, and so we'd be pleased to see that gap close, and that would certainly help support our own pricing initiatives as well.  But the key for us is to focus on us and what we're doing -- having that -- those conversations with customers demonstrating the value that we can add relative to the industry and just looking at what our needs would be to keep driving the cash from operations and the strength of our balance sheet even stronger to support further investments to keep growing the company. Operator : And the next question comes from Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Adam, on the 47,000 to 50,000 uplift in shipments, are there any mix changes there? Because if it is coming from some diversion obviously, yellow have significantly lower weight per shipment. And I don't know if there's any mix observations that may bifurcate shipments from tonnage?  And then if we take this kind of new elevated tonnage number for the last couple of days here and we assume kind of it holds, what does August look like from a year-over-year perspective?  And then the last question, 3 parter, but 1 question. Yellow is very different than OD. And obviously, yellow, there's -- I know you don't want to address yellow specifically, but they're the third largest LTL company, and they seem to be on the brink of going out of business.  And so the question is, if Yellow customers are looking to divert, is -- do you think OD is the natural relief out there because you are kind of the most expensive best service company out there? I'm just trying to understand, are you the right barometer for that or maybe you see some of it, but a lot of it goes elsewhere. Adam Satterfield : Yes. I see if I can try to address those in some sense of order, but to answer your first question from a mix standpoint, not a lot has changed with mix. Our weight per shipments dropped a little bit. We've gotten down to about -- we dropped about 10 pounds. We've gotten down to about 1,525 pound average or so, and it's dropped about 10 pounds or so here recently.  But not a lot is changing. I think some of that is, we are -- seems to be picking up some more of the smaller tariff-based customers that generally got a little bit lower weight per shipment. So that's been good to see, if you will, overall. And whether or not that continues remains to be seen.  And obviously, this is all just kind of developing. But I don't want to get into if we hold this trend steady, hold that trend steady, I mean, generally, August sequentially is up about 0.5% for our shipments per day are up about 0.5% over July. And we'd expect that some of this recent trend, it's possible that if things continue to hold steady like they have, I talked about the impact of July for that, but obviously, that could carry forward a little bit stronger, but we'll just take it 1 step at a time and keep giving the updates out there as they are.  But we were -- last year, in August, we were at about an average of 51,000 shipments per day. So it starts closing the gap, if you will, if we can hold 50,000 steady. But keep in mind and that's what I was alluding to earlier that there's a natural progression that happens from the beginning of the month to the end of the month, and we were already starting to see some trends.  So I don't know that you can't just take that gap from where we've been averaging 47,000 shipments a day really since December of last year and just say, okay, there's this immediate incremental change. There's been change that's been developing. And you can't disappoint the one specific player to say, this is the reason why. It's been a developing trend, and it's the way history has played out for us. When we get to the end of the cycle, we start winning business from different carriers.  And so with that said, I think that there may be direct freight opportunities, but indirect trade opportunities as well that may come out of if there is an industry event. And I think that's still an if. And we don't know any more than anybody else. But we just are staying engaged with our customers, making sure that they understand the capacity that we have.  And I think everyone knows the service that we can offer and no different than I think 2021 is an example where freight was obviously coming to us very quickly that year, and we stepped up in a very big way through the second and third quarters. And a lot of the conversations that we had with shippers being will be similar conversations that we have now. We protect our existing customers capacity for them and that's how we would manage through if we get into another period where the freight opportunity is accelerating significantly. Operator : And the next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Thomas Wadewitz : I wanted to go back to your comment on the capacity in the network. You referred to the 30% being above what your target is. I guess if you kind of juxtapose that with there may be opportunity for terminals related to the discussion we've been having about the big industry participants that's under pressure. So I'm wondering, would you consider being opportunistic and say, \"Hey, we've got maybe more capacity than we need in the network, but there is an opportunity to kind of bring in a bunch of additional terminals that maybe fit well?\" Or just how do you think about that and the kind of pace of terminal additions if you look at, I don't know, next 2 years, something like that? Adam Satterfield : Yes. Tom, we're always looking for opportunities. And that's why we try to stay so far ahead of the growth curve. We generally are looking at each service center in each region and projecting out 5 years of potential growth to know where we're going to have facilities that start hitting capacity.  And those are the ones that go on our target list for kind of we roll out internally a 2-year capital expenditure plan to expand service center capacity and where we need it. So sometimes an opportunity presents itself that maybe we don't need this particular location, but in year 4, for example, but if it's a good facility, then we would go ahead and take advantage of it.  And again, it gets back to, we've got our long-term market share initiatives and what we think we can achieve over a longer period of time and so we know we're going to keep growing this network. We've been one of a few carriers that have been expanding. Many talk about it, but when you look over the last 10 years and you look at the capacity additions that we've made, the public carriers in total are actually down in terms of the number of service centers in the industry.  So we're going to continue to say that's a big part of our value proposition is, we're consistently investing dollars to be able to support our customers' growth and make sure that we can be there when our customers need us the most and when they've got growth potential but they need an LTL carrier to be able to respond, and we not just be able to respond in the middle of the month when things aren't as busy, but at the end of the month when they're trying to get the freight moved off the dock and deliver to their customers, that's 1 thing that they can rely on OD. So we'll certainly continue to look for opportunities, and we would be opportunistic in adding facilities if it makes sense within the long-term vision for our network. Operator : And the next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Kenneth Hoexter : I guess if we look back on the scale of an industry shift like this, right, where I guess, consolidated freight ways back in '02 or New England motor freight right where you've had big and quick historical rapid change. Maybe talk a little bit about -- you talked about customer discussions accelerating. Are these kind of existing customers, Adam, I think you threw out there the top 50 customers, their business was down also, but are you seeing that mainly from internal, are you having new discussions? I presume not that many, just given, I guess, any user of Yellow is maybe looking for lower cost versus higher quality. And then maybe secondary is your thought on headcount, right, as you make this shift, I know you've got the 30% excess capacity on the facilities, what's your thoughts on headcount and capacity there as well? Kevin Freeman : Yes. Yes, we currently talk to new customers every week. We have over 500 salespeople and part of their job is to bring on new business. So they're out there having discussions about onboarding new customers every week, but -- and as well as existing customers and if the customers have questions about capacity, of course, we answer those.  We show them where we have capacity, our terminal network and so forth. So that -- those are just ongoing discussions. But as far as labor, we have the labor covered. We have a driver training school where we have -- we call them combo drivers.  If we're not utilizing them during slow periods, they go on the dock and then we can bring them back onto a truck as our tonnage and shipments increase. So we feel like we're pretty covered on labor. And for any increases, it might come our way. So I feel confident we can take on whatever comes our way. Kenneth Hoexter : And then just I guess to clarify, Marty, do you -- mind just a follow-up here. I know you said or Adam said it was a slow kind of grind here. But I just want to understand, in the last 48 hours, has this not been a massive shift?  I guess I understand they stopped picking up freight last night. I just want to understand the speed and scale with which we're talking about here. Kevin Freeman : Yes. We're reading the same thing as you are. So we really don't know what's going on, but we're talking about it within our senior management team every day and how we're going to put forth our plan to handle additional business. But we're not really seeing any major business coming out of that. And just like you, we don't know how that's going to end up. So we don't want to speculate at this time. Operator : And the next question comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Bruce Chan : Adam and Marty, I'm not sure if this got captured in some of the previous answers, but I wanted to ask it maybe a little bit more directly. If you think about the potential share wins from this, I guess, impending competitor exit, would you expect to see outsized share gains given your capacity expansion or maybe slower share gains given a more disciplined yield approach and what you mentioned was a higher average price than the market? Kevin Freeman : Well, as you know, we're very disciplined on price, and we're not going to do anything to trash our service by taking on too much freight. So we expect if something were to happen that we would remain disciplined in that manner. And like Adam said, we'd look after our existing customers and we cost out every piece of business that comes through this truck line.  And if it doesn't have the yield that we expect, we just won't take it on. But -- and we also expect if there is a major event happens that we'll gain business probably from other carriers that weren't participating in that event because they may take on too much revenue and trash their service and we'll benefit from that as well. So we've experienced that before and ready for it again. Operator : And the next question comes from Eric Morgan with Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : So I just had a follow-up on the headcount comment. Marty, you mentioned you're confident from a labor perspective that you can handle some of this incremental freight. Are you saying that you think you can handle the surge with limited headcount increases from here or are you just more confident that you'll be able to ramp up your labor force accordingly if you do see volume tick up?  And then I was also just curious on cost per employee. Any thoughts there. I know it's been kind of trending roughly flattish, up a little, down a little over the last few quarters? Just curious how this could affect that metric. Adam Satterfield : Yes. This is Adam. But -- we've had a decrease in headcount or we do sequentially through the second quarter and we've seen attrition really going back into last year through our business. But I think that -- like I mentioned, there's 3 elements of capacity, and we certainly -- we've got plenty. We talk mostly about our service center piece. But we've got equipment capacity to respond to the acceleration in business levels and from a people standpoint, we can do the same.  We've shown that type of flex in our workforce in the past. I mean we've got people that I think we can call back as well. Marty mentioned, our internal truck driving school, that's created about 1/3 of our drivers and sometimes drivers come out of that school, but continue to work on the platform until demand is such that we put them into a full-time driving job. So there's multiple opportunities. The other lever that we could pull. And we did this going back to looking at those 2021 sequential trends. But as business accelerated really through the second half of 2020 continuing through 2021 as needed, we don't like to do this, but we can use purchase transportation to supplement the capacity of our workforce or our fleet.  And so it just kind of depends on the pace at which volume comes on, but we had those big quarter-after-quarter sequential increases during those periods back in the end and that was kind of the final lever to pull. And -- so we certainly can have that. We would rather move our linehaul 100% of our fleet and with our people. But as necessary, we sometimes have to supplement, and that's kind of the source that we could go to on a very short-term basis. It would always be with the idea that we get it back 100% in-sourced as soon as possible if we had to go that route. Operator : Next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Adam, you mentioned a couple of times just like the intra-month seasonality of shipments that obviously, we just don't know. I wouldn't normally ask it like a short-term question, but it's obviously an unusual time.  Maybe if it's possible. Can you just like just share like year-over-year tonnage the last couple of days, like what that's trending? I just -- we just want to get a sense of like run rate very recently. And then -- the -- I think yield is down 3%-or-so in July. Any sense what yield ex-fuel is doing in July? Adam Satterfield : Yes. And that we had had already talked about in the prepared comments, but it's somewhere 6.5% to 7% the revenue per hundredweight, excluding the fuel surcharge. Obviously, right now, we're getting -- continuing to see fuel that's down. I think July should be the worst.  At this point, we continue to average where we are fuel will be down about 30% again. But in the third quarter of last year was when fuel prices started declining, and then that continued on. So that will be less of a headwind, as we go through the second half of this year. But we're continuing to get core increases, as Marty mentioned earlier, and the key will be to continue to look at whether it's us or others, is there a sequential increase there.  That's what we strive every day, we've got contracts that are turning over. And we're going through those contracts and able to negotiate increases if mix is relatively constant, you should see sequential increases in those yield metrics. But like I mentioned, the last few days, we've been right at around 50,000 shipments per day. Some of that is just the natural growth that happens towards the end of the month. And whether it accelerates from there kind of remains to be seen. I held that 50,000 numbers that I gave this morning assumed that we kind of held that 50,000 constant for the remaining workdays, today through Friday and Monday of next week.  So if there's numbers that when we put them in our queue that are different from what we talked about today, then you can sort of judge from there where things came in. July of last year, was a little over 51,000 and 52,000 shipments per day and I mentioned, August was 50,000 to 51,000. So we're back to where our shipments per day if this kind of 50 were the hold content, and I'm not saying that it does, to where we're closer from a volume standpoint to where we were last year.  And then just sort of getting back to the -- keep trying to bring us back to the big picture, I think that success ain't going to be defined by what we can do next week and next month or next quarter, it's -- what's the market share potential over the long term, and we still feel confident about what our long-term market share potential can be because we still win business by the quality of our service.  Our value proposition is delivering superior service at a fair price and always maintaining network capacity to support our customers' growth. And I think we continue to win share because of the service and capacity advantages that we have in the marketplace, and that will extend beyond what may be happening over the next few weeks. Scott Group : So Adam, your point there is that others may get maybe a little bit more of the volume day 1, but to the extent that they struggle with this big surge in volume, you'll then get it on a derivative basis, maybe it's not day 1, but it's weeks or months from now. Is that kind of what you're trying to say? Adam Satterfield : Exactly. Slow and steady generally wins the rates, and we want to be patient with the things. And certainly, we're looking and having conversations with customers and want to help where we can. But just like in 2021, you got to be careful about opportunity. You don't want to take on so much so fast that you end up not being able to deliver on the service value that we offer with 99% on time and on a claims ratio of 0.1%. So we want to be methodical about the way we go through this and make sure that we're protecting servicing capacity for our existing shippers without taking on too much of what opportunity may be out there.  And so I think when you go back and you look in prior trends, like I said, we stepped up in the second quarter more so than anyone else. When you look at 2021, when you look at that sequential acceleration, and then we continue to follow on from there where others didn't. So it's always just making sure that you don't over-extend yourself in the short term and just keep that eye on the ball for the long-term vision. Operator : And the next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Sorry to say this topic, but I just wanted to kind of basically clean up the commentary on this call, which is the uptick in volume that you see in the last few days, how much of that is because of a cyclical improvement versus flow-through from what's going on at your competitor? Like is it 1 of the 2 of them? Is it both? And kind of can you tell the 2 of those apart? Adam Satterfield : It's really hard to try to bifurcate and put your finger on what's driving any type of acceleration there. As I've mentioned, we would expect to see an increase. We're going into the final full week of the month. We would expect to see a normal type of increase. And it's a little bit above where I'd originally forecast this week to be at least, but when I go back to Friday was a bit heavier and then Monday and Tuesday have been a little bit heavier than what I had originally looked at.  And so is that just because we've got more business from an existing customer that's having their own end of month surge? Yes, that's part of it. Is it freight that's coming in, we're -- there's been some freight diversion? Yes, that's a part of it.  So you just can't put your finger on everything when we're doing 50,000 shipments a day, why did we get this 1 particular shipment? But that's why I wanted to point out that really, I think this goes back to, for several weeks, I feel like we've seen some pretty nice trends. We closed out the month of June strong. I feel like when we go back, even though our number of shipments per day have been around 47,000, we've had some good end-of-month performance. And the trends, the intra-month trends have been pretty good the last couple of months as well. We dropped off some early in the month, which that's typical too, but maybe dropping off a little bit more so than what a week-by-week average would be.  But then we've made up for it as we've progressed through the month. So I've been pleased with our performance so far in July and it looks like at least right now when we project out and carry that trend forward of shipments per day that we're still down in comparison to June. Some of that is July is a 20-workday month and the way the July 4 holiday fell that Monday that we were open was probably half of a normal workday. So if you kind of adjust for that, we had seen better trends.  We have been more in the 48,000-or-so shipments per day range kind of through the month before this recent pickup happened. So it's just not -- I can't put your finger on what completely is driving the change other than you go back and this is somewhat typical to what we would see at the end of a slow period like we've been in since April of last year and then it's just been accelerated over the last few work days from there. Ravi Shanker : Very helpful. Super quick follow-up. Did you take any short-term cost savings actions in this quarter that may potentially unwind if tonnage really comes back? Adam Satterfield : We keep our belts tight every day. So we're always looking at managing our variable cost and controlling discretionary spending where we can and where it makes sense. But that's a philosophy that you can't just sort of take it or leave it. It's a mindset that you have to stay in, in good times and in bad. If you don't have that mindset in the good times, you're not going to be able to switch gears when you really need to.  So I think that we certainly have been able to trim out some cost and I was pleased we ended up with a better operating ratio in the second quarter than what we had initially talked about. So that was good to see. And I think that I mentioned earlier, we're going to have some of those overhead cost categories.  Overhead costs are about 19.5% to 20% of our revenue in total when he split those out and our direct costs are 2.5% to 53% of revenue. We're going to have some cost increases. We're continuing to have depreciation dollars that will increase from the second to the third quarter.  Our general supplies and expenses should be up in the third quarter over the second. And then I would expect that our miscellaneous expenses would be up as well. So those dollar costs will be there. Whether or not we've got some revenue growth to offset them kind of remains to be seen similar to what we were talking about before. So -- but some of those dollars will be increasing from the second to the third. Operator : And the next question comes from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Jason Seidl : I wanted to focus again on what's going on with Yellow and look out at pricing. I don't think I heard this, but generally, I wouldn't have expected anybody to try to push the GRI through, excluding what's been happening. But do you think there is a likelihood that this occurs now if there is a bankruptcy in the near future? Kevin Freeman : As I said before, I don't want to speculate what's going to happen but I will say that we took our GRI in January, and we don't foresee having to take another one this year as it relates to transactional business. I mean we're going to manage the same way we would with them or without them.  So I can't speak for the other carriers, but I would say -- maybe some of them do need to firm up their prices with it, and maybe they'll use that as an opportunity. Who knows. But we've got a good handle on our cost, and we had that before YRC and we'll have it after. So I don't see us considering a GRI on transactional business. Jason Seidl : Okay. Marty, that makes sense. So you're not expecting it, but you wouldn't be surprised if maybe others tried because you're not exactly at your level. I wanted to, Adam, jump on something you mentioned with sort of slow and steady wins the race and freight coming back with people not being able to handle it. But even if people handle it, won't there be cases of freight not being what people think and it's just needing to find proper homes within a given network? Adam Satterfield : Typically, that plays out exactly as you described. where it may find a temporary home, but then ultimately, and in some cases, people have just got to get their freight moved and they may go to the next closest carrier from a price standpoint. And just to keep their supply chain moving. But ultimately, if they want value in their supply chain, that freight will find a home at Old Dominion. Operator : And the next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Stephanie Moore : I was wondering if you could maybe touch on the performance you've seen if there's been any differentiating trends between maybe your more retail consumer customers and then those that are more maybe industrial-focused?  And then same thing, if you're hearing from your customers, kind of their expectations as you go into the back half of this year, thoughts on inventory levels where they stand today? Just any kind of bigger picture color would be helpful. Adam Satterfield : Yes. We saw generally consistent performance in the second quarter with the industrial and our retail-related customers. Industrial is 55% to 60% of our business overall. And historically, we look at ISM and industrial production, which I assume has been below 50 or at or below 50, I think, for 9 months now and that generally reconciles with the industry volumes. And certainly aligns with the second quarter when we were down 14%. But overall, we think that some of the conversations that we've had that we get the sense that inventory levels are normalizing a bit. That's kind of supported my baseline thinking of getting back to some consistency with volumes going into the second half of this year. And that would be back in alignment with what our normal sequential trends are with volumes anyways.  Typically, in the third quarter, our shipments are up about 1.5% to 2% over the second quarter. And then we generally have about a 3.5% decrease in the fourth quarter. So we've been -- there's been a pretty wide gap between our sequential -- actual sequential trends relative to the 10-year average for the past few quarters. So I felt like we were -- in a normalized environment, we're going to get back to closer to those 10-year average trends and then hopefully then get back to seeing real growth once we got into 2024.  But -- so it seems like some of the tea leaves and some of the conversations that we've had with customers would suggest this normalization and then freight actually picking up and moving again, which was the positive that we were looking at and thinking about and planning for in terms of the second half of this year in 2024.  And then obviously, we've had some recent developments that have accelerated things a little further here over the last week-or-so. Operator : And the next question comes from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Bascome Majors : Yes. As you look back over the last couple of months and -- but inclusive of the last few days, can you talk a little bit about the drivers of getting back to that normal sequential trend? And by that, I mean specifically, the like-for-like shipments from existing customers versus new customer acquisition versus anything else that you'd like to kind of size up directionally in magnitude as you think about filling that excess capacity over the next several quarters? Adam Satterfield : Yes. Like I said earlier, and we've talked about this on recent calls. From a core contract customer standpoint, we've actually had good trends. And when we look at having a double-digit decrease in volumes that may seem counterintuitive. But certainly, the economy has weighed on many customers and has impacted their trends.  But when we look at our our national account business and the wins that we've had versus losses, we continue to have the good wins and have not really lost any share to speak of with those larger national accounts, but they've just had reduced volumes.  We have lost and have talked about our business levels with third-party logistics companies has been down in recent quarters and that was still negative in the second quarter as well. But that's something where I think that certainly shippers have been looking to save cost and they've been using the 3PLs to find carriers that had a little cheaper price than us maybe and divert some freight away for that reason. But I think now, just like we've seen in prior cycles, servicing capacity are coming squarely back into focus for many shippers. And so I think that lends itself to how we've won market share over the long term. So there's not necessarily any one piece of business that's changing any more than others. We've got a lot of consistency within our largest accounts, and these are long-term strong relationships that we have between us and our customers.  And so our sales team, our pricing team, they're staying in front of our customers and staying engaged and making sure that they know we're here when they need us. And we're increasingly getting those inbound phone calls and being able to take on some incremental business.  So it's good to see, but we still would like to see the overall macro environment improving, would love to see the ISM going back above 50 and really talking about more of a true improvement in the underlying demand environment versus what the supply situation in the industry might be. Operator : And the next question comes from Christopher Kuhn with Benchmark. Christopher Kuhn : I just wondering, the West Coast ports had a bit of a pickup in June. Just wondering, I know some of it is indirect if that benefited some of the volumes that you saw and then maybe if it picks up as the year progresses, would that help the Kevin Freeman : Yes. This is Marty. I read the other day that in June, imports from China to the U.S. fell 24%. Taiwan, it fell 23%, Vietnam 11% and South Korea 6%. So we haven't seen a lot of energy coming from those ports. As you know, we have a division on the East Coast ports and those business levels are down there. So I think the whole global economy is still rather yield, but we're prepared to handle that, too, if it picks up, but we're not seeing any of that movement so far this year in an upward manner. Operator : And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor to Marty Freeman for any closing comments. Kevin Freeman : Yes. I want to thank you all today for your participation, and we appreciate all the questions. And if you have any further questions, please feel free to call us after the call. And I hope you guys have a great day and a good rest of your summer. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Marty Freeman. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Freeman : Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me today on the call is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion's third quarter financial results reflect continued softness in the domestic economy. As a result, our shipment levels decreased on a year-over-year basis for the fifth straight quarter. Some encouraging trends developed during the quarter as our LTL shipments per day averaged 49,670 after averaging 47,077 per day for the first six months of the year. While a portion of this growth can be attributed to the loss of one large competitor, we believe we are winning new business from other carriers in the industry due to the quality of our service and overall value provided to our customers. The OD team effectively responded to this positive inflection in volumes by continuing to offer superior service at a fair price. We were pleased that our on-time performance was 99% during the quarter while our cargo claims ratio was 0.1%. As we have said many times before, service means much more than just picking up and delivering to our customers freight on-time and claims free. There are many other attributes that shippers consider when selecting a carrier such as consistent transit times, carrier trustworthiness and ease of doing business. Mastio & Company conducts a comprehensive LTL study each year and they recently measured carriers on 28 different service and value-related attributes. Mastio published their 2023 results just this week and we are extremely proud to be named the number one national LTL provider for the 14th straight year. Logistic professionals ranked OD as number one for 25 of the 28 individual attributes in the most recent survey, which was our best performance ever and demonstrates our unwavering commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction. We believe the consistency and quality of our service over many years has validated by Mastio has differentiated Old Dominion in the marketplace and supported our ability to win market share over the long-term. Our superior service also continues to support our ongoing yield management initiatives. We focus on obtaining consistent yield increases each year to offset our cost inflation and support our ongoing investments in capacity and technology. Maintaining excess capacity during slower economic environments comes at a cost, but we believe having an available capacity for customers when they need it the most is critical element for our value proposition. As a result, we consistently invest in service center capacity, equipment, technology, and most importantly, our people. Because of these investments, we are well positioned to respond to the positive inflection in volumes during the quarter. It is important to note that while other carriers may have the ability to invest in service centers, equipment and technology, [indiscernible] family of employees that truly distinguishes us from our competition. We have a unique company culture that has defined who we are for a [indiscernible] for many years, delivering superior service at a fair price having a consistent approach to pricing and investing for growth may sound like a simple formula, but it takes a committed team to keep delivering on these fundamental elements for a long-term strategic plan. The execution by our team and consistency in our long-term financial results gives us a continued confidence in our strategic plan. We remain committed to this plan and believe we are better positioned than any other carrier in our industry to win market share over the long-term. As we continue to deliver our unmatched value proposition to our customers over the long-term, we are confident that we can create further profitable growth and increase shareholder value. Thank you very much for joining us this morning, and now, Adam will discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Marty, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue decreased 5.5% in the third quarter of 2023 due to a 6.9% decrease in LTL tons per day that was partially offset by a 3.1% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. We also had one less operating day as compared to the third quarter 2022. The combination of this decrease in revenue and slight deterioration in our operating ratio contributed to the 8.0% decrease in earnings per diluted share to $3.09 for the quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the third quarter increased 8.9% when compared to the second quarter of 2023 with LTL tons per day increasing 3.6% and LTL shipments per day increasing 5.7%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes an increase of 2.9% in revenue per day, an increase of 0.7% in tons per day, and an increase of 1.8% in shipments per day. As Marty just mentioned, a portion of this increase can be attributed to the loss of one large competitor as underlying demand has remained relatively consistent throughout the quarter. We do believe, however, that we are also winning new business from other carriers in the industry due to the quality of our service and overall value provided to our customers. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the third quarter were as follows : July decreased 1.5% as compared with June, August increased 4.7% versus July and September increased 2.7% as compared to August. The 10-year average change for the respective months is a decrease of 3.1% in July, an increase of 0.1% in August and an increase of 3.6% in September. For October, we expect our revenue per day will increase by approximately 1.5% to 2% when compared to October 2022, with a decrease of approximately 2% to 2.5% in our LTL tons per day. While our shipment levels for the month have been stronger than our normal sequential trend, we believe a portion of this outperformance is attributable to a cybersecurity incident disclosed by a competitor. We would expect some of the incremental growth in October will return to that competitor in November. As usual, we will provide actual revenue related details for October in our third quarter Form 10-Q. Our third quarter operating ratio increased 150 basis points to 70.6% as the increase in overhead cost as a percent of revenue more than offset the improvement in our direct cost. While the decreasing revenue had a deleveraging effect on our cost categories that are more fixed in nature, we were pleased with the increase in operating efficiencies that helped drive the improvement in our direct cost. We also continued with our best efforts to control discretionary spending to minimize the increase in overhead expenses as a percent of revenue. We did, however, continue to execute on our 2023 capital expenditure plan to help ensure that we have the necessary capacity for anticipated growth once the domestic economy improves. This resulted in a 110 basis point increase in our depreciation expenses as a percent of revenue. That, along with the increase in employee benefit cost largely contributed to the overall increase in overhead expenses. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $429.2 million and $1.1 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. While capital expenditures were $172 million and $651.4 million for the same periods. We utilized $65.9 million and $368.1 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. While cash dividends totaled $43.7 million and $131.5 million for the same periods, our effective tax rate for the third quarter 2023 was 24.0% as compared to 23.9% in the third quarter 2022. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25.6% for the fourth quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we will be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Allison Poliniak : Hi. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about the density improvement that you saw in the network? And any way to quantify that? And then maybe following that, just touch on how much excess capacity you have in the system today to take on some more volumes? Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Sure. Our current level of excess capacity, which is in our service center network is now between 25% to 30%. We did improve density within our operations during the quarter and that was a big factor in driving the improvement in our direct operating costs, at least the improvement that we saw both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. But we leverage that inflection in the volumes and we always say long-term improvement in the operating ratio was driven by two key factors; density and yield and both generally support \u2013 or require the support of a macro economic environment is positive, but we had good leverage there that drove some nice operating efficiencies within our pickup delivery operations on the dock as well had improvement. We still had a slight decrease in our linehaul load factor, but that's improved from where we were earlier in the year. So all those factors contributed to the improvement in our direct cost as a percent of revenue during the quarter. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question is from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead. Jack Atkins : Okay. Great. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So I guess, Adam, as you think about the sequential progression into the fourth quarter, I know there are a lot of puts and takes with October and the disruption \u2013 the further disruption of the market in October. But could you maybe talk about your expectation for \u2013 or maybe how we should be thinking about operating ratio trends sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, all things considered? Adam Satterfield : Sure. Typically, the fourth quarter operating ratio is 200 basis points to 250 basis points worse than the third quarter. A couple of factors drive that. Usually, revenues a little bit softer. We give our wage increase the first of September, so we get three, four months within the quarter with that new wage rate, but multiple factors that generally are driving that change. One thing to note, we also do an actuarial assessment each year, we conduct that in the fourth quarter, and we normalize for that, just to assume it stays flat with the previous quarter, but we've seen adjustments in the past. That can be favorable, which is what we had last year as well as unfavorable. So assuming those costs stay different, I think that we can be in the 150 basis point to 200 basis point deterioration range, so slightly better than what we would historically see. Some of that, we're obviously starting the quarter out with a little favorability versus our normal sequential trend as we discussed. And so I think that we expect some volumes to kind of normalize, if you will, back to where they otherwise would have been for November and December. But that still gives us a little bit of a head start, and I think will help us drive a little bit of outperformance versus our normal trend there. Jack Atkins : Okay. Makes sense. Thanks for the time. Operator : The next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Great. Good morning, everyone. So just maybe a 2024 question, if you will. It looks like yourselves and maybe a lot of the big LTLs still have a fair bit of excess capacity in their network even after absorbing the yellow volumes. I'm wondering how you think the kind of \u2013 how numbers will play out when the upcycle comes. Do you expect to see the market has suddenly tightened up and there to be like a rising tide of pricing? Or do you just think that you get better incremental margins as the volumes come in? Kind of where do you think the 2024 upcycle looks like in a post Yellow situation at this point? Adam Satterfield : Well, I think it's yet to be determined for 2024. Certainly, there's a lot of tea leaves that would suggest this could be a year of inflection. But we also believe the same thing we thought we were going to see a rebound in the spring of this year, so we're cautiously optimistic about what next year may bring. As we've said before, with the post Yellow situation, we want to be measured with our approach and continue to believe that slow and steady wins the race. So we didn't try to go out and immediately win as much share as was out there in the market, but we're trying to do it in the right way in leveraging the capacity that we have and not just the capacity and the service in the network, there's a people capacity element as well as equipment. And I don't know that there's as much capacity in the market, as you may have indicated with your question because we're hearing it every day. We're hearing about competitors that are missing pickups. They don't have the people part of the capacity equation solved and maybe took on too much freight and are starting to have negative implications from their overall service products. So we believe that we'll continue to win market share, but do it in the right way by giving superior service at a fair price to our customers and offering a value that's unmatched in our industry. And if we get some positive economic support, I think that you've seen in past cycles when we actually get there, 2018 and 2021 are good examples where we try to stay ahead of the growth curve with the capacity investments that we consistently make to be able to take on that volume when it's there. And when we look at those two years that I just referenced, we significantly outgrew the markets in those years despite the strength in underlying demand because of that excess capacity that we had in place. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thanks, Adam. Operator : The next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Christian Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe I could piggyback on that a little bit. As we think about 2024, I know normally you guys talk about costs. You talked about price sort of relative to cost and be able to need to exceed that in any sort of normal year. I guess in post Yellow, as you think about 2024, do we need to see something else to be able to sort of spark a better-than-normal pricing year for you guys in 2024? I think there are expectations that next year naturally would be because of what happened with Yellow. But is a normal cyclical recovery enough to spark something that would be better than average? I just want to get your sort of general take on how sort of spring loaded or not you think the pricing environment is? Adam Satterfield : Yes, sure. Well, I think the environment continues to be strong overall, especially given the supply shock that happened. But I think our approach is different from many of our competitors. We believe in a long-term consistent approach to pricing. And we try to target obtaining 100 basis points to 150 basis points of price above cost each year. We've had some cost pressure this year, and that's evident in our numbers. But I believe that, that starts improving as we go into next year, especially if we can get a little bit of volume recovery. We're already seeing the core inflation in our business moderating. It did in the third quarter. And I think that same trend can carry through in 4Q and into 2024 as well. But I think the market should certainly be conducive to us being able to obtain the increases that we believe we need to justify and cover our cost inflation, but also the investments that we're making in capacity. We're only a carrier that's really investing significantly in service center capacity. We've invested $2 billion over the last 10 years. And as a result, we've been able to increase our door capacity by 50%. And when you look at the public LTL companies at least, which are 65% to 70% of the market, overall capacity there is down close to 10%. And so I think that customers understand that and continue to give us the increases that we need that basically support the value proposition that we're able to offer them. When you think about the supply chain challenges and whatnot that shippers have had to work through over the last couple of years, in particular, capacity hasn't necessarily been at the forefront of the conversation over the last year, but over the last three, and it certainly has been critical. And so we feel like that's what we need to continue to focus on. But we'll continue with our same approach like we always have, and it's produced good things for us from a financial results standpoint, but an improvement in our balance sheet to support the ongoing investments that we believe we need to continue to make. Christian Wetherbee : Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I want to ask about your perspective on share gains. So we've pulled forward, I guess, about 10 years of share gains from Yellow into a quarter. I guess do you think post Yellow, the pace of share gain for you guys in future years will be as good as what we've seen from you historically? And I guess I'm curious about this question in the context of this upcoming Yellow auction. I mean ultimately, I guess I want to know like how much \u2013 what is your strategy in terms of terminal growth? And how much do you want to add? Obviously, you were involved in the stalking-horse bid. What's the strategy here with this upcoming auction? Adam Satterfield : Well, we don't want to get into any details on that, just given the fact that it's ongoing, and we're continuing to evaluate those options. But our long-term strategic plan didn't depend on one competitor going out of business and us being able to obtain real estate from them. Our plan will continue to be \u2013 give superior service at a fair price. And service is what wins market share for us as well as having available capacity. Again, you look at the performance that we have with our volumes and market share in 2018, 2021, 10 points outperformance versus the industry. And that wasn't just Yellow that we were comparing against. It is the industry, so we win share from others. And I believe we've been able to capture more market share for the \u2013 when you look at the growth in the industry than anyone else as well. We've doubled our market share over the last 10 years that will require investment as we go forward. We expect that we'll continue to spend 10% to 15% of our revenues each year on capital expenditures. That will continue to be within real estate and with equipment to support our anticipated growth, but we certainly believe that we can be the biggest market share winner over the next 10 years, just like we have over the past 10 because of the value offering that we have, just validated by Mastio this week. We've won this award 14 years in a row. We're very proud. We had better performance than we've ever had in the survey, winning 25 of the 28 attributes that they measure. And our overall gap between us and the industry widened out further than it's ever been. So we feel good about where we are, but we're also focused on making sure that our service continuously improves as we go forward, and that's what will be key to our ability to win share. Scott Group : So if I understand, Adam, you don't think that like your long-term volume growth share gain is any different going forward post Yellow? Adam Satterfield : Not at all. I don't think the formula changes just because they're not here and they're 45,000, 50,000 shipments, whatever it was, is now dispersed. And that share is somewhat with us, somewhat with other carriers. I think there's probably an element of it that went into the truckload world as well that probably will, at some point, be rebalanced within LTL once the truckload world tightens up. That's yet to be seen, but trying to trace the number of shipments they had versus at least what the public carriers have disclosed, there's a missing element there that I believe may have landed in the truckload world. But for us, the conversations that we have with customers, the long-term trends that we think will support growth in the LTL industry, be it continued improvement with e-commerce trends, that's conducing to moving freight by LTL, whether we see increased manufacturing, at least in North America, a lot of those things will be more conducive to freight moving by LTL for which there's no one in the industry that is delivering the same type of service and value that we can offer customers. And so that's what we'll remain focused on. We've got to continue to focus on managing our cost inflation, and we focused particularly on that as well. So we can continue to have that 100 basis point to 150 basis point price versus cost spread keeping our prices relative to the industry. But certainly, when you think about the overall value equation, there's no one that we believe can match what we can offer a shipper. Scott Group : I appreciate the thought. Thank you, guys. Operator : The next question is from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, operator. Hi, Marty. Hi, Adam. I had two questions, if that's okay. So first question, you just did like a 70 and change OR in a broad freight environment that's pretty weak, to say the least. Does that \u2013 that obviously informs the opportunity in a broadly better freight environment? I know you have the [indiscernible] OR target, but I was wondering if you can update us that because I assume you're quite happy and impressed with the resiliency of the OR and what has been a weak market even including Yellow. And then I want to push back a little bit on the Mastio. Obviously, you guys on a headline basis, have been exceptional. And I know it's really hard to get that number one national carrier position. But the value proposition for OD historically has been, yes, we're more expensive. But on a total cost basis, we're still better because of our claims ratio and our on-time performance. And you guys always were in the middle or below that fair value band in the Mastio survey. Today, you're kind of at the tippy top. And it's hard to improve 99% service, 0.1% claims ratio, but your price is going up, which on the margin reduces the value that you provide to the market, which may explain some of the market share. I'm sure you disagree with this, but help me understand how you think about moving up towards the very top of the fair value band and what that means for your market share opportunity going forward? Adam Satterfield : Well, there's always going to be movement there. And what we've got to go by is not necessarily that data. That data is very important, and we pay a lot of attention to it, but it's the conversations we have every day with customers. And the conversations when we go back to post pandemic when someone may have moved freight away from us because of price and trying to save a little bit, but if they were in jeopardy of losing a customer because the freight never got picked up or it never got delivered, then there's a premium there for sure. If your product is not on the shelf available for sale, if you've got a production line that shut down, waiting on a part or a piece, I think shippers are looking more strategically at value. That seems to be the outcome post pandemic world. And anytime we go through a slow environment like we've been for the last year, there can be some movement within some of those categories. But for us, trying to have a consistent approach to pricing each year, being able to sit across the table from a customer and have an open, honest conversation about being fair to us and being fair to them is what we strive for. And to be able to make the investments that we're doing, like I said earlier, capacity may not have been at the top of mind over the last year because of the overall weakness in underlying demand. And then you had a couple of carriers earlier this year that were making some changes and doing some different things with respect to their pricing. So those are things that you always have that are challenges that you manage through. But that environment changes pretty quickly. And keep reference in 2021, that was a period where competitors were increasing rates faster than us where they're more up playing the market plan versus having a consistent approach. And all of a sudden, we look like a lot better value, if you will, when our service is way ahead on the spectrum. But now that someone has closed that pricing gap because they've come in and taken the 10%, 15% type of rate increase, that's what drives market share to us, and it's market share that stays sticky. We have had great continuity within our large accounts when we look at our top national accounts. We don't have turnover in that business over the past 12 months. We've not lost accounts or lost lanes just in many cases, that the demand environment has been weaker. So demand for our customers' products, if you will. They've not been able to tender as much freight to us. So it's something that we always are relevant and mindful of where our pricing is relative to others. But we do what we need to do and what makes sense for us. That's part of our long-term strategic plan and we just make sure we communicate what our needs are going to be with customers. And it's a model that's worked. We've been able to grow our revenues 11% to 12% on average each year over the past 10 years. And that's the same formula that we want to be able to work as we move forward. It's consistent and it sounds like a simple plan, but there's a lot of complexities behind the scenes, if you will. And we just want to keep executing and believe we can. And I think that as we go through the next 12 months, if we see some real economic recovery, I think that we'll see our numbers continue to outperform from a growth standpoint than the industry, just like we've seen in prior cycles. Amit Mehrotra : Got it. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Jonathan Chappell : Thank you. Adam, you're able to handle this surge of 3Q business without really changing the cost structure that much. So as we think about kind of a return to cyclical recovery at some point next year, whether it's first half or back half loaded, did this surge in volume in the third quarter and October absorb a lot of your spare capacity and a lot of the ability to have the incremental margin expansion, so as you can see the volume recovery on a more sticky basis, you can still increase the cost structure on a lesser one-for-one basis and get that historical OR improvement? Or is there going to be a bit of a catch-up where you're going to have to add more labor, more resources if the broader demand tailwind actually accelerates next year? Adam Satterfield : Well, we were in a great spot coming in to this quarter from a labor standpoint, from an equipment standpoint and definitely from a service center standpoint, and we've intentionally been heavy. We've tried to protect as many driver positions in particular that we could as we've gone through this slow period. We certainly have seen some attrition within our workforce over the past year. But we've tried to keep as many people on board as we could, knowing that the inflection would individually happened. We believe that it was going to happen earlier in the year. And obviously, we're disappointed when it didn't, but we just continue to try to manage through. And here we are. It did happen in the manner that we thought that it would, but we were well positioned to respond and our existing workforce has been able to do so. Now from here, we have restarted the hiring process in some locations. And we'll continue to run our internal truck driving schools to produce new drivers and have them available as the demand levels dictate. If our shipment volumes continue to increase, if we can see sequential improvement through next year. We want to make sure that we've got all elements of capacity in place to be able to deal with it and not be playing from behind, if you will, and having to try to catch it or not being able to say yes to a customer if they're coming to us and asking if we can handle incremental volumes for them. So it's always a challenge to try to walk that tightrope in terms of managing the elements of capacity. But I think that we did a great job with getting through it this year and we may have carried a little extra cost in doing so. But I think our operating ratio has performed about where we thought it would, given the decrease in volumes. We said earlier in the year that our focus would be to managing our direct cost even in a low volume environment. We've been able to do so without any sacrifice whatsoever to our service quality. In fact, some of our service metrics have actually improved as we've gone through this year. So we're pleased with where our service quality is, the performance of our team, the improving efficiencies that we're seeing. We'll continue to add to the team and continue to rebalance our fleet as well. As we go through 2024, we've still got some deferred replacements that \u2013 where we want to improve the average age of our fleet. But all of that will continue to be worked out as we go through the next year or so. And we want to get back to a growth environment, improving operating ratio environment, all those things we're kind of used to seeing, we just need a little cooperation from the economy to help us along the way. Jonathan Chappell : Got it. Thank you, Adam. Operator : The next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead. Thomas Wadewitz : Yes. Good morning. Adam, you've talked a bit about \u2013 I think you said like inflation can come down somewhat next year. And then you've talked a bit about price as well, and you've seen a pretty constructive view on where price is going to be next year. If we don't see improvement in the freight market activity, do you think you'd be looking at those two factors supporting margin improvement because it seems like you put those two together, you would see the margin improve. But how do you think about, I guess, lower inflation and a favorable price and what that does for margin, even if you don't see freight improve? Adam Satterfield : Well, I think that we had \u2013 for one thing, we had a pretty hefty CapEx year this year. And when you look at our operating ratio and the change that we have in the third quarter, that was a bit of a headwind, 110 basis points headwind on the depreciation side and some of the CapEx was basically related to what's happened over the last couple of years with the OEM challenges that we've had, shortages of parts that have required us to carry maybe a little bit more equipment on the books than we would sort of look at from an \u2013 if we were optimizing the fleet standpoint. So I think as we go through next year, if it looks like it's going to be another flattish year, we're already sort of a leg up, if you will. A lot of times, you can take September volumes for the month and kind of just use that to correlate to what the next year's volumes will be. And so we might be looking at even if it's underlying demand doesn't change at all. We believe that we've got the opportunity to win some of the share that we continue to believe will be turning around over the next six months to a year given some of the service issues that I referenced earlier, we're hearing about every day. But we're already in a position where we might see a little bit of volume growth. And then get some yield on top of that, that in an environment where cost may be improving as well. Then yes, that's the environment where in the past, we've been able to produce some operating ratio improvement. Thomas Wadewitz : So I mean it sounds like you feel pretty good about where you're at in 2024, even if you don't see a lot of improvement in the freight market? Adam Satterfield : I think so. I mean, we're certainly \u2013 we saw the step-up basically in August. And then I was pleased with the performance that we had in September. And when we talked about post the mid-quarter update, where we were from a shipments per day standpoint, we had been at 47,000 shipments per day since December of last year. And basically, that average carried forward through July. We saw that step up. We've talked about kind of an incremental 3,000 shipments per day, and that's where we were in August. In September, normally, it's a 2.5% to 3% increase in shipments per day would be normal seasonality. Although the last month of the first quarter and the second quarter we saw a little bit of a pickup, but nothing close to where normal seasonality would be. That's kind of where we've been missing some of the growth over the last year, but our shipments per day were up 2.1%. So that performed a lot better than what we've been seeing at least in the last month of the quarter, and that really was no new impact. That's just some share shift and then existing customers that are giving us more freight, if you will. So there's been a lot obviously going on over the last four months within the industry, some things obviously permanent. And then like we mentioned, I believe that we'll see some of the volume gain that we had in October that will return to a competitor. So trying to kind of figure out where the daily shipment count gets to in November and December is a little difficult. But if things kind of shake out, if we had just normalized, if you will, and we're more along normal seasonal patterns, we would have been in an environment where \u2013 or if we get back to that from November, December, rather, to where our shipment counts are more flattish, with where we were last year in the fourth quarter and revenue is probably becoming more flattish as well versus being down 5.5% in the third quarter. It may still be down slightly, but it's getting \u2013 everything is kind of getting back to flattish. And I think that, that's a good position to build on as we go into 2024. Hopefully, we'll continue to see some more of those share gains, like I mentioned, just service related. And then if we can get a little bit of help from the economy, then that would build on even more volumes and then we'll just continue to execute, like I said earlier, on the volume side and managing costs. And if we can have that positive delta there, then that's a good setup even if underlying demand is not significantly changing. If it does, and we're not going to precall it like we did last year. But if it does, then that's the type of environment where I think our model shines the brightest when competitors are at capacity issues, and we believe that's happening just based on customer feedback today, then that's when we can really put on the incremental volumes that we build our network up to be prepared for. And so that possibility is out there, but a lot depends on what we may see from an overall economic standpoint. Thomas Wadewitz : Right. Okay. Great. Thanks for the perspective, Adam. Operator : The next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jordan Alliger : Yes. Hi. Spoke quite a bit about price on the call today. I'm just curious on mix and the types of shipments you're getting, obviously, weight per shipment, maybe discussing that, which is basically trended down, sort of thoughts around that and shipment mix? Thank you. Adam Satterfield : Yes. Our weight per shipment has trended down and really it went down, I guess, in August to about 1,485 pounds, and that was some of that incremental freight that we saw that pickup of about 3,000 shipments per day. Increased a little bit in September, which you'd expect, and we're kind of hanging around that 1,485 pound range here in October as well. So that's something where I believe we're kind of at a baseline, reflecting kind of the underlying freight that's in our book right now. And that will be a metric to watch to see are there increased orders for widgets, does that 1,485 pounds \u2013 do we see that grow to 1,500 to 1,520 pounds getting back closer to the 1,600 pound range that we've seen in robust economies. So it's \u2013 like anything, the freight that you take on as long as you understand the handling characteristics and what the pricing ought to be, that decrease in weight per shipment did have a little bit of a favorable impact on our yield metrics during the quarter. But that's what we have built our business on is investing heavily in all the tools and technologies to understand the freight that we're moving to make sure that we're moving everything profitably with the right pricing in place. And I think that we've made those adjustments to the incremental freight that we've seen thus far. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Eric Morgan with Barclays. Please go ahead. Eric Morgan : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to come back to the near-term. I think for September, you said tonnage was about one point below average seasonality on a sequential basis. But you have confidence you're gaining market share and underlying demand on study. So just wondering if you can clarify that and maybe if you're seeing any attrition from the initial wave of share shifts. I guess kind of along the lines of an earlier question, just wondering how any new customers you have from this are responding to your premium service but also premium price offering? Adam Satterfield : Yes. We \u2013 from a tonnage standpoint, the sequential increase in September from August was up 2.7%, the 10-year average change is a 3.6% increase. So \u2013 but that compares favorably to what our performance has been in the third month of the first few quarters of the year, was the point that I was making. We've seen a little bit stronger pickup in September coming to us versus what we had seen earlier in the year and really no new events, if you will, within the industry that were driving any of that change, just a continuation of some of that freight that had to move at the end of July, we had made the point on the last call that obviously, shippers had to find an immediate home for that freight, and they likely leverage the existing carriers that they had in their networks or at least the large national accounts did. But we believe in and continue to believe that there's going to be some share shifting around. But I think that especially as we go through the fourth quarter, the first quarter of next year, two periods that are seasonally slower during the year is probably the type of environment that shippers will be looking at their overall supply chain partners and figuring out what's the right solution to have. And so I think that we'll see some churn that will be happening over the next six months. I think that there are probably some customers that were at competitors previously that are taking on margin increases right now at a time when their service is probably deteriorating, that it will also be looking at the value that OD can provide. And those are the types of accounts that we've seen in prior periods. It's obviously, the situation is different, but I think it could be very similar to 2021. That environment was just all demand-driven, but demand was incredibly strong. There is tremendous opportunity there from a volume standpoint. And a lot of the competitors simply couldn't take on the incremental volumes because they didn't have all the elements of capacity in place to be able to do so. And they're missing pickups, They're not able to get the freight that they do pick up, delivered on time. And those are the types of customers that increasingly call on Old Dominion. And we're starting to have some of those same types of conversations, maybe not at the same level at this point, but we're having those same conversations today. And we think that, that will create some incremental volume opportunity for us as we progress through the next few quarters. Eric Morgan : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kenneth Hoexter : Hey, great. Good morning, Marty and Adam. So the market, obviously, at 30x earnings, taking this a little bit in stride here this morning, maybe it's because the 2%, 2.5% downtick in October, maybe some of the SDs give back expectations. But I guess maybe the expectation was for faster growth and that you'd be able to keep the OR, yet you're talking about more measured growth. So I just want to dig into this. There was a great discussion with Scott earlier into your outlook and your thoughts on sustained growth. But maybe thoughts about the industry and the competitive nature of it, right? So if you've got this bid process on the service centers coming up, which means the capacity just goes elsewhere, it doesn't go away. And maybe everybody thought it was going to go away and that would enable you to continue to take that share. Maybe your thoughts on what does that lack of tightening, right, if more of that capacity spills out to the market on your ability to take that? And I know, Adam, you couldn't give your thoughts on it, but maybe just give the factual stuff, maybe the timing of the service center bids, just so we're all on top of the exact nature of the distribution of those? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I think over the next few weeks, bids will be due. And so I think a lot will be determined, obviously, in the next month or so and figuring out who may end up with some of those service centers. I still believe that some of that capacity will be leaving the industry overall. But the reality is all of those shipments that were in place before, it's been several months now. They found a new home. And so if you\u2019re \u2013 someone on the strategic side that might be investing, you've got to look and think about how that would make sense, how much incremental capacity do you want to buy that you would have to go out and how would you use it kind of thing. And so those are some of the thoughts that in considerations that I'm sure that we have and that others have as well. But again, from our standpoint, we believe we continue to grow. We will continue to invest in one shape or form, whether it's trying to go back after some of these properties in that bid or if it's something totally independent, which was the path that we were on before they closed their doors. Either way, I think when we think about the long-term, and that's the lens that we try to view our business through, we believe we will be the biggest market share winner over the next 10 years because of the quality of service that we offer and the value offering that we have in place. That's going to require investment. Just because you invest doesn't mean you're going to go win share. And if someone does, then it's probably increasing their cost basis. And that could be a good thing for us as well if our competitors' costs are increasing, requiring them to increase rates, even further and maybe closing some of that price gap that exists between us and others. So I think that we tried to say on the last quarter call that our approach is going to be more slow and steady, if you will in this environment where underlying demand is \u2013 continues to remain relatively consistent. We've not seen any type of true inflection in the economy at this point and we're prepared for it when it happens. And I think we've seen some really strong performance in the past when we get into those types of strong demand environment. So we're ready for it from thinking about all elements of capacity. It's more than just service centers. Service centers drive what can be done over the long-term, but you got to have people and equipment as well. And we feel good about where we are with all elements of capacity and our ability to respond to growth when it comes to us, and it will. It's just a matter of time before it comes. And so we'll be ready when that time does come. Kenneth Hoexter : Thanks, Adam. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Bascome Majors : You talked earlier about starting to invest again in headcount and get ready for some of the growth that may come next year. Can you give us an update about where you are versus your capacity on facilities, people and equipment now? And any thoughts about where those constraints are showing up first, be it regionally or in functionally? Thank you. Adam Satterfield : Yes. We're \u2013 on the service center side, we're at about 25% to 30% excess capacity. We'll necessarily look at those other two pieces of the capacity equation in the same type of way. But our equipment, we're in really good shape with where we are, probably a little bit heavy steel even with the influx of volume that we've seen over the last few months. But like I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to go through and evaluate and optimize that as we look at what our 2024 CapEx plan might be. We've not formulated that at this point, and we'll talk about it on the next earnings call. But what the fleet size should look like given whatever our baseline forecast for 2024 might be. And then we always look at kind of a bull case scenario and a bear case scenario as well to make sure that we've got an operating plan that can meet if we were to see really strong growth or the growth, not necessarily at the levels that our baseline indicated. On the people side, obviously, we've been able to step up and meet the incremental volumes. Our people are getting more work, which I think makes them happy per se. And we had drivers that we're working on the dock and combo type of roles. So we're able to leverage that, putting those employees right back into a truck. And so overall, I think we're in a really great spot with all elements. But it will require, as we get into next year, we do see some incremental growth from where we are now will require investment in our people. And that's why we've restarted some of our truck driving schools, and we are hiring in certain locations as well for new drivers, employees on the platform that are moving the freight on their docks as well. So we will continue to add to the workforce, if you will, as we make our best efforts to match the capacity of our workforce with the shipment levels that we sort of see coming at us, but making sure that they're on board ahead of the curve, so they're properly trained especially on the dock that we make sure that we're maximizing our load factor. We're using our claims prevention tools to keep that cargo claims ratio where it is at 0.1%, all those things are important. But you can't just throw a person right into an environment where we're growing double digits kind of thing. They're just not going to be as efficient or as effective as we probably otherwise won't. So we try to invest ahead of the curve, if you will, for that reason, to make sure that we get appropriate training in place before we really see the growth. Bascome Majors : Thank you for that, Adam. Operator : The next question is from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Bruce Chan : Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. Adam, maybe just want to follow-up on some of your comments on the commercial side. You've got a couple of competitors out there that are targeting that field accounts business. I want to ask you if you feel like you have the right mix of field national and 3PL at this point or things are kind of changing post Yellow. And then just quickly on the sales force, any additions that have happened there to maybe fill out the newer parts of the network and keep pushing on that share growth? Thank you. Adam Satterfield : Yes, I feel like our \u2013 we've got a great sales team in place that national account team and local field sales that have been working hard over the last year in terms of continuing to build relationships, staying in front of our customers, letting them know that we're here when they need us, and our team work hand in hand with our pricing and costing groups as well. And I think that, that coordination and symmetry that we have there, is evident when you look at our long-term success and our financial results. But we \u2013 about one-third of our business does come by way of 3PLs. We've actually seen a little bit of improvement there. In the third quarter, we had a little bit of growth with the accounts that are within that 3PL book of business just ever so slightly, but at least it was in the green when the overall book of business, the overall revenue was down 5.5% for the quarter, so that was good to see. That was an area of weakness, in particular in the first quarter, where a few carriers, we're putting some lower transaction type pricing in place. And I think that market firmed up pretty quickly in the end of July. So some of that business is starting to come back to us and hopefully, that can be a continuing trend as well. But we've got a great mix of our contract business and continue to grow with our small mom-and-pop accounts as well. And the 3PLs, we see opportunity within all of those categories really and our sales team will continue to leverage that and hopefully be ready for a good growth year in 2024. Operator : The next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Stephanie Moore : Hi. Good morning and thank you. I'll keep it easy here and cheat and just essentially re-ask Amit\u2019s first question. Given the 70s and change OR you saw in the current quarter and what is admittedly still a pretty weak freight environment. And also, I think you called out pretty well on this call, which is to spend your own kind of elevated expenses in 2023. Maybe just how the dynamics over the last couple of months change the timing of achieving that kind of six handle OR target just as you balance this obvious major industry events as well as your own kind of moderated growth and capacity investment strategy? Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Sure. It's \u2013 when we laid out the goal to have a sub-70 annual operating ratio, we didn't put a timeframe per se on that because we felt like we might go through \u2013 and a macro environment that's a little bit weaker, and we didn't want to be beholden to some artificial timeline and do things that were more short-term focused versus long-term. And I think when you look at this year, in particular, to have a capital expenditure plan of $720 million in an environment where at one point, we were \u2013 our tonnage was down double digits shows the focus that we try to take on looking out in the long-term and being ready for future growth. And that comes at a cost, and we've seen that increase in the operating ratio this year as a result. And again, the depreciation is probably the biggest drag that we have right now, but that's something that when you look at it on the other hand, when volumes come back, that's where we get leverage. And I've been pleased with the cost performance on the direct cost side. In the third quarter, our direct costs were 51% to 51.5% of overall revenue while our overhead came in at about 19.5% of revenue, and that compares to last year, our overhead was 16.5% to 17%, so deterioration there. But once we get back to the volume environment, we should be able to leverage that completely and get right back to improving our operating ratio, so we're already closed. We've done a couple of quarters with the second and third quarters of last year with 69 something operating ratio. And typically, when we look back through prior years, when we've gone through an environment where volumes have been down, revenue was down, we've lost a little bit on the operating ratio because of that leverage opportunity, we've been able to recover any OR loss in the subsequent year when we've had revenue recovery. And I think that's certainly what we're focused on and believe can happen. So we'll see where that gets us by the time we get to the end of 2024, but we will continue to perform on the direct cost side and continue to look for areas of opportunity as we can drive efficiency within our operations. But trying to get some leverage there on the overhead side, potentially not having to invest as much in 2024, and if we can get some revenue growth going along with that, could potentially produce a beautiful thing when you start looking at that OR. Stephanie Moore : Great. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Marty Freeman for any closing remarks. Kevin Freeman : Thank you all today for your participation. We appreciate your questions, and please feel free to give us a call later if you have anything further. Hope you all have a great day.

Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Freeman : Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. With me today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion's fourth quarter financial results reflect continued softness in the domestic economy, which is similar to how the economic environment fell throughout much of 2023. As a result, the rebound in volumes that we had anticipated back in the spring never fully materialized. Despite the softness in the economy and weaker-than-expected volumes, the OD team faithfully executed on the same long-term strategic plan that has guided us through the ups and downs of the economic cycle many times before. During the fourth quarter, our LTL tons per day decreased 2% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Although our LTL shipments per day and overall market share improved, we also improved the quality of our revenue during the quarter as well, which contributed to an increase in both our quarterly revenue and earnings per diluted share for the first time in 2023. We believe that underlying demand for our LTL service remained consistent in the quarter, which corresponds to the consistency in our volume trends. The stability of our volumes also reflects our ongoing ability to deliver best-in-class value proposition. We were pleased to provide an on-time service performance of 99%, and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1% during the quarter, which also supported the ongoing execution of our yield management initiatives. We have said many times before that long-term improvement in our operating ratio is dependent upon a consistent improvement in density and yield, both of which generally require the support of a positive macro environment. While our network density was challenged this year, we improved our yield by maintaining our consistent cost-based approach to our pricing. This approach focuses on improving the profitability of each customer through yield increases that are designed to offset our cost inflation and support further investments in capacity and technology. We continue to invest significantly during the 2023, as we remain confident in our ability to win market share over the long-term. Our capital expenditures totaled $757.3 million for the year, of which $291.1 million was spent for the ongoing expansion of our service center network. We opened two new service centers in 2023 and have several others under construction and nearly complete that could be opened quickly once the demand environment improves. Our team knows firsthand how quickly the demand environment can change in the LTL industry, and we are very experienced at growing our company without sacrificing the quality of our service. To do so, however, requires us to maintain a certain amount of excess capacity in our service center network. We are pleased to currently have approximately 30% excess capacity in our network, and we have the ability to expand it further as needed to help ensure our network is never limiting factor to our growth. While the investments in our service center network, our equipment and our technology further improved the overall quality of our service in 2023, the best investment we made was in the OD Family of employees. We improved the capabilities of our team and strengthened our unique company culture, which has defined OD for many years. Our long-term strategic plan may sound simple on the surface, but no one in our industry has been able to replicate our success because they do not have our people or our culture. Our team is fully committed to our proven business model. And as a result, we believe we are strongly positioned to respond to a positive inflection in demand once the domestic economy begins to improve. We are confident in the opportunities that lie ahead, and it is our belief, our team's focus on delivering superior service at a fair price will support our ability to produce further profitable growth while increasing shareholder value. I want to thank you today for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Marty, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.5 billion, which was a 0.3% increase from the prior year. This slight increase in revenue was primarily due to a 3.0% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight that more than offset the 2.0% decrease in LTL tons per day. Our quarterly operating ratio was 71.8% and earnings per diluted share were $2.94, which was a 0.7% increase from last year. As Marty previously mentioned, this was the first quarter with an increase in both revenue and earnings per diluted share since the fourth quarter of last year. While it certainly has not felt like one of our record years from the past, $2.94 also represents a new company record for fourth quarter earnings per diluted share. On a sequential basis, our revenue per day for the fourth quarter increased 1.9% when compared to the third quarter of 2023, with LTL tons per day increasing 0.6%, and LTL shipments per day decreasing 0.3%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes a decrease of 0.8% in revenue per day, a decrease of 1.6% in tons per day and a decrease of 3.4% in shipments per day. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the fourth quarter were as follows : October decreased 0.7% as compared to September, November decreased 0.6% from October and December decreased 4.8% as compared to November. The 10-year average change for these respective months is a decrease of 3.5% in October, an increase of 3.5% in November and a decrease of 8.0% in December. For January, we expect our revenue per day will decrease approximately 3.1% as compared to January of 2023, with a decrease of approximately 5.1% in our LTL tons per day. These numbers could be plus or minus 10 basis points or 20 basis points, depending upon today's revenue performance. We expect our revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, will increase approximately 6.4%, which is generally in line with normal seasonality for this metric. We will file the actual revenue-related details for January in our Form 10-K. Our operating ratio increased 60 basis points to 71.8% for the fourth quarter. We continued to operate efficiently during the quarter despite the lack of network density, but our direct operating costs increased as a percent of revenue. The increase in these costs was primarily due to an increase in our insurance and claims expense as a percent of revenue, which is attributable to changes in the annual adjustment we record in our fourth quarter each year relating to our third-party actuarial reviews. We were otherwise pleased with our control over direct operating costs during the quarter, as our team did a nice job of matching labor to current revenue trends. While our LTL shipments per day increased, our average headcount was down 4.1% when compared to the fourth quarter 2022. We currently believe that our workforce is appropriately sized for our current shipment trends, but we will likely need to add to our workforce this year as volumes begin to improve. Our overhead cost also increased as a percent of revenue despite our best efforts to control discretionary spending. Depreciation expense as a percent of revenue increased 80 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter 2022, due primarily to the execution of our 2023 capital expenditure plan. The increases in depreciation and other overhead costs were partially offset by a 90 basis point improvement in our miscellaneous expenses as a percent of revenue, which included $15.1 million of gains on the disposal of property and equipment. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $436.7 million for the fourth quarter and $1.6 billion for the year, while capital expenditures were $105.9 million and $757.3 million for the same respective periods. We utilized $85.5 million and $453.6 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the fourth quarter and 2023, respectively, while cash dividends totaled $43.6 million and $175.1 million for the same periods. We were pleased that our Board of Directors approved a 30% increase for the quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share for the first quarter of 2024. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 24.1% as compared to 25.0% in the fourth quarter of 2022. We currently anticipate our annual effective tax rate to be 25.6% for 2024. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, team. This is Matt on for Bruce Chan. Thanks for taking our question. You've highlighted some market share gains in the past couple of quarters here post-Yellow, and wanted to get your sense of to what extent do you expect these to continue as more competitors bring on new capacity? Adam Satterfield : Sure. Certainly our long-term story has been winning market share over time, and we believe we'll continue to win market share into the future as well primarily based on the value proposition that we offer a superior service at a fair price. And as we mentioned earlier, our on-time service continued to be 99% during the quarter, and our claims ratio is at 0.1%, and that is what's driven our market share over time. Typically, when we're in a slower macro environment like we've been in, our market share tends to be flatter. But once we start seeing a recovery in the economy, that's when we think our model signs the brightest. If you look back in periods past, when the up cycle begins, that's when we've got plenty of network capacity, the job that we've done with managing our people capacity and equipment capacity as well, combining with the real estate positions us to capitalize on those upswings. And that's when in the past, we've been able to outgrow the other publicly traded peers anywhere from 600 basis points to 1,000 basis points. So we're still waiting on that positive inflection in the economy, but I feel like we're better positioned than we've ever been to capitalize on it when the upswing begins. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks for that. And as a quick follow-up, how do you see industry capacity this year versus last year? And do you have a quick view of what percentage of latent off-line capacity might return as we progress throughout this year? Thanks a lot. Adam Satterfield : Well, I think that there's a lot of settling that still needs to occur post the Yellow closing their doors. But if you go back a year or more, we were a capacity constrained industry, and I feel like once all the dust settles, capacity is shifting around a bit, but will continue to be a capacity constrained industry. All of those service centers will not end up in the market, yet all of those freight shipments will be and will have to be handled by someone. So I feel like, especially once the economy recovers, we'll most likely be viewed as a capacity constrained industry once again. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe I have a follow-up on that. And I would just love to get your thoughts on how the Yellow asset auctions spanned out versus your expectations? And maybe a broader question there is based on that. Do you think the next up cycle is going to play out differently with the redistribution of capacity from one entity like Yellow that was constantly seeding share over several years to a handful of entities now trying to gain share? Do you think that changes the competitor dynamics at all? Adam Satterfield : I don't think so. Just like I mentioned before, we've been able to win market share over the long-term based on the quality of our service, first and foremost, on the value proposition that we're offering our customers. And we believe that, that same formula will continue to win share for us, as we go forward, it takes having capacity to be able to continue to grow. And that's why we've always invested ahead of the growth curve and tried to target having about 25% excess capacity in the service center network at all times. And so right now, we mentioned that we're at about 30% excess capacity. So we're a little north of where we've historically been, but we believe it's always important to consistently invest and keep that focus on the long-term opportunities and that certainly played to our benefit in the past. And it's hard to say with the Yellow process, with their service centers. But net-net, we believe that there would be some exit of capacity, and I think that's generally what we'll end up seeing once all the dust has settled on things. And we obviously took a look at those service centers early on, didn't end up with anything. And that's why given the state of where our network is today and the opportunities that we continue to have to expand it, and we felt like just given the cost that \u2013 you can see now in hindsight that it was better for us to just maintain control, our network is in a great spot as it is, but we continue to have the ability to control when we add to the network in time, where we decide to add the facilities and how exactly we want to build them. So we felt like continuing with the same formula that's worked for so many years for us. We want to keep executing on that same business plan as we go forward. Ravi Shanker : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Christian Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess I wanted to talk a little bit sort of near-term and get a sense of how things are progressing, I guess, first quarter. We've seen some weather here in January. I think typically, OR gets a little bit worse as we go from 4Q to 1Q, but maybe you can put some \u2013 help us a little bit. I think there were some moving parts, in particular, in the fourth quarter with the gain as well as some of the insurance actuarial stuff that was going on there. So just kind of get a sense of how you're thinking about the first quarter both from sort of an operational perspective, but also from an OR standpoint? Adam Satterfield : Yes. Winter weather comes every year, and it's something that we contend with, and is generally in our averages. So we don't view that as a one-time event. But a couple of weeks ago, us and everyone else had to deal with weather issues and made up for a little bit of lost ground with that last week. And then we've got a short week to finish out the month, the year. So we'll see where the final numbers land. But as of right now, our shipments per day are trending pretty much in line with where we thought they would be. I gave the 10-year average earlier with respect to the sequential changes from a shipments per day standpoint. Our December was 5.9% below November, that's better than the 10-year average. But over the last five years, we've kind of changed \u2013 we've given one extra day of paid time off around the holidays. And so our five-year average in December is actually a decrease of 6.5%. So we were a little bit better than that revised average that changes the month a little bit, not so much the quarter. But looking at January, the five-year average sequential change is a plus 0.3% increase, and so we'll see where we end up. But I feel like that certainly that number has been impacted a little bit, looks like it's going to come in below that overall sequential number that we would go up a bit. But how much will we get back in February, where we see kind of a traditional bump and then March will continue to be the important month. That's a month where we're typically up about 5% sequentially over February. And if you remember, we anticipated in 2023 that we would see a recovery in the spring. And unfortunately, it didn't materialize like we thought it would, but that will kind of be the key point for this quarter is will we start seeing that reacceleration in our business levels, and that obviously dictate a lot in terms of the operating ratio and general performance for the first quarter. Christian Wetherbee : And just one point of clarification. So for 4Q, do you think that with those two big moving parts, that's sort of the number that we have is the right jump-off number as we think about that normal sequential progression of OR? Adam Satterfield : Well, the normal change in OR from the fourth to the first quarter is about a 100 basis point increase, maybe 110 basis points. And those two particular items that we called out in the press release, we'd expect some normalization, if you will. To start with, the insurance and claims, that was 1.9% of revenue in the fourth quarter. That number had averaged 1.2%, 1.3% each quarter in the first three quarters of the year. And so we'd expect that to somewhat normalize and our expense to be more consistent in the first, second and third quarters of 2024. Now it maybe a little bit higher \u2013 we've had four or five straight years of double-digit premium increases and continue to contend with higher cost in that line item, but I still expect that, that would be maybe 1.3%, 1.4% of revenue in the first quarter. So get maybe 50 basis points of benefit, if you will, as we transition into the first quarter on that line item. And then the miscellaneous expenses, we wouldn't expect for those gains to be that significant. That was pretty unusual. Typically, that miscellaneous \u2013 the expense line item is 40 basis points or 50 basis points. And so we'd expect that to somewhat go back to normal as well. So that could be kind of 100 basis point, 110 basis point headwind. So I think just net-net, thinking about the 71.8 that we did in the fourth quarter, as we transition into the first, maybe 170 basis points to 220 basis points deterioration, 170 would be kind of normalizing for those items that I just mentioned. And then just maybe being on the high side of that was just the uncertainty of where we really get the economic recovery and volume performance through the quarter, that acceleration that we normally would. If we get that acceleration, we're certainly managing all of our costs, and it could be on the low end of the scale or better. But as of right now, probably better to just handicap it on the higher side of that normalized average. Christian Wetherbee : Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ken Hoexter : Great. Adam, just to clarify that insurance and claims that was an annual adjustment, right? So when you talk about normalizing, I just want to understand that actuarial change. But my question would be on \u2013 you didn't bid for the \u2013 or I guess, maybe win the centers, maybe your thoughts on in the industry, if you think there was \u2013 I presume you think then there was overpayment, right, given you were trying to be the stalking horse bid. So what does that mean for the environment? Do you think those peers need to get a return quickly on that investment, and you see increased pricing competition? I just want to understand your thoughts or view on what the impact of overpaying from your peers' competitive perspective means? Adam Satterfield : Well, I won't say anybody overpaid. We looked at the whole thing, obviously, with that initial bid and felt like if we could get everything and get it at somewhat of a discounted pricing than we were willing to take that risk, and obviously, it would have come with increased cost if we had absorbed all that property. But I think each carrier is different, they look at those opportunities. And I guess that fit in with their long-term strategic plan. I think if anything, it's increased in the cost basis. And like we've said for many years, as we've invested in real estate, you've got to build that into your overall cost structure and appropriately capture that with rates. And that's been our strategy over time and it's certainly played to our advantage. So if our competitors' cost structures are increasing, I wouldn't expect that they would change their approach to pricing. But I think if anything, they've got to build it in there and try to capture for it. But fortunately, that's something that we're not having to contend with. Like I mentioned earlier, we're good with our strategy, and we feel like it's worked for us over time, and we believe that same formula and strategy can continue to work for us in the future. So that's what we're going to keep executing under. Ken Hoexter : And I'm sorry, thanks for that. Great answer, but do you mind clarifying on the insurance? Adam Satterfield : Sure. Yes. You're right. We do an annual actuarial assessment in the fourth quarter each year of our reserves. And so we, unfortunately, had an unfavorable adjustment this year. And those go either way. The last few years, they've been favorable adjustments. And we've got an expense rate that we use through the first three quarters of the year, and that's why you see that number that's more consistent, if you will, but \u2013 and then we just had that third-party review done make adjustments and then just kind of move on. But just looking at that activity, that's why I think that our expense rate will be a little bit higher in 2024 through the first three quarters versus where we were last year, but maybe only 10, 20 basis points or so, and then we'll conduct another actuarial assessment in the fourth quarter of 2024, make whatever adjustments are necessary then and then just move on. But I think it's been \u2013 since 2019 was last year, we had an unfavorable one. So best case scenarios when we get to the end of the year, they conduct the study, and we don't have an adjustment either way. But unfortunately, this year, it was an unfavorable one. Ken Hoexter : Great. Thanks for that. Appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Amit Mehrotra : Hey. Thanks. Adam, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that maybe there's a need to add headcount in anticipation of volume growth. Can you just put a little bit more color around that? How far ahead of this inflection of volume, when could we expect the headcount to go and how quickly? And then, the industry is always \u2013 another follow-up to that. The industry has obviously been disrupted over the last six months and the dust is settling, curious to get your view on like how you think the competitive dynamic has evolved from both a service quality perspective and a pricing perspective. Have you seen service disruptions? I know there's maybe early signs of that in the third quarter, but have those fixed itself or you continue to see services structure to create market share opportunities for you? And what are you seeing on the competitive pricing side that makes you feel better or worse or neutral about kind of where the discipline is in the industry? Adam Satterfield : Yes. That's a lot in one question. I'll see if I can keep it all straight. But we have heard about some service issues and we obviously stay very engaged with our customer base, our large national accounts and 3PL customer accounts as well and meet with them often. And so we have heard about some service issues and believe that, that's something that may continue. And it's very typical in an up cycle, especially. And so I think some of the carriers that maybe took on some of that extra Yellow business may cause some issues for them throughout the system or their system. And so that's usually a source of market share for us especially when the economy starts to pick up. But from a pricing standpoint, it's continued to be a very favorable pricing environment, I would say. We've seen \u2013 obviously, we've continued on with our consistent and cost-based increases, and that will be our strategy going forward as well. But just looking at some of the GRIs and some of the feedback that we've had from [indiscernible] as well, it seems like the other carriers have continued to push for increases. So that's generally a good thing for us as well. If the competitors are increasing their rates. And again, increasing demand environments. Generally, we see competitors that are increasing rates faster than us. And if we're at a price premium to the market and that gap closes, that too, creates market share opportunity for us. So that's why we feel good about where we're positioned and the opportunities that we have going forward. It's been a long, slow cycle that we've been in. ISM has been below 50 for 14 months now. And you compare that to 2008, 2009, I think, was below 50 for 12 months. It's been a very long, slow cycle that we're ready to get back to growing again. But, you know, going through these slow cycles requires patience. And I think we've managed well, managed cost efficiencies, managed our discretionary spending to go through a year where tonnage was down 9%. Our operating ratio was at 72, to me was pretty remarkable. And so I'm really proud of what our team accomplished this year and what we've done to position ourselves for opportunities that are ahead. Amit Mehrotra : Yeah, agreed. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Jonathan Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Adam, thanks for the commentary around the 4Q to 1Q move in the OR, given some of the noise in the fourth quarter. As we think about the rest of the year, and I know it's difficult to predict the volume landscape, so let me frame it, if you will. It sounds like you're in a good position, 30% capacity. Maybe you can see the whites of the eyes on adding headcount, maybe both PT lever if necessary, if things kind of accelerate quicker than expected. But should we expect a return to kind of normal seasonal trends in the OR this year? Or can we see even better in the first maybe nine months, if you get some of the volume back on a stickier basis, more of an industrial recovery and then maybe lag a little bit some of the resources that you need to handle that just given your spare capacity today. Adam Satterfield : Yes. I mean, obviously, a lot of it is going to be volume dependent, and we'll really get some type of economic recovery and when does that begin? It'd be great to see it start early. But I'm not sure that the general economic forecasters are predicting that things are going to start so early in the year. But we're ready. We actually hired and increased our headcount during the fourth quarter, much of which was on the platform where we were hiring folks to backfill some of the jobs where our combo employees with the freight volumes that were higher in the second half of the year, we pulled people off the dock and put them right back into a truck, and we're driving again. So we backfilled some of those positions in particular. But we're cautiously optimistic about things, and we're not going to get ahead of it by any means. So once we start seeing line of sight into some volume recovery, and increased demand, and we'll make sure that we're adding to the workforce as appropriate to keep up with it to make sure that we're efficiently handling any growth that comes without any sacrifice to the quality of our service. But I would say that from a big picture standpoint, when you look back in time and just thinking about the fiscal year overall, generally, when we've gone through a slow period, even going back to 2009, 2016, 2019, we've gone through periods that have been really slow. If we've lost anything from an operating ratio standpoint when the volumes and revenue come back into the system, we've been able to more than recover that OR loss. And back to our cost structure and really pleased with the performance, as I said, but we generated improvement in our direct operating cost for the year this year, even despite the lack of density that we had with the volume weakness. And really, the OR loss was just limited to our overhead expenses increasing, and most of that was depreciation as we continue to expand the network as we brought in new equipment into our fleet to replace some of the older stuff that we've been hanging on to the last couple of years with OEM challenges. So as we incurred a lot of the expense on our own selectively, we're positioning ourselves to capitalize on future growth opportunities. So that will be the power of leverage in the model, is once we get that topline growth going again, we'll continue to be able to improve further those direct operating costs as a percent of revenue, but we regained lost ground on the overhead side, get right back to the operating ratio improvement and have that same formula work and where we're growing the topline, improving the operating ratio and having the income growing faster than the revenues. And that's producing profitable growth has been our long-term story, and it's led to a big increase in shareholder value over time as well. Jonathan Chappell : Yes. Okay. Thank you, Adam. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead. Thomas Wadewitz : Yes. Good morning. I wanted to ask you just on pricing and I guess if we look at the January, I think you said the January is up like 6.4% and 4Q was 7.5%, I believe, for revenue per hundredweight ex-fuel. Do you think there's kind of further deceleration in the pace of year-over-year pricing that you would expect looking forward? And where do you think things settle out? Is it 4 or 5? And then I guess, just one other kind of related question. How do you think we ought to think about cost inflation this year compared to what it was last year? Thank you. Adam Satterfield : Sure. Yes, from a \u2013 just a revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, if you apply normal seasonality quarter-by-quarter, then the yields would compress to around 6.5% growth, kind of in the first and second quarters, and then that would start to moderate to be closer to 5.5% by the fourth quarter, which \u2013 as you know, if you look long-term, our revenue per shipment has been more in the 5%, 5.5% range over time. So we'd expect, absent any mix changes for that \u2013 for us to be able to get consistent increases as we go through the year, as bids are coming new and that's why you just see that absolute number increase quarter-by-quarter. But that rate of growth may start to compress. Now granted, I had anticipated that it would compress a little bit last year and we had the decrease in weight per shipment. And so that supported some of that reported yield metric. Now the reverse could happen this year, especially as we get into the back half of the year. If the economy is improving, we'd expect weight per shipment to be higher, and that generally results in a lower revenue per hundredweight. So \u2013 but higher revenue per shipment. So it all kind of balanced out. We believe this year. That will be the more important factor, though, we feel like is will we start seeing some real growth in that revenue \u2013 or I mean, weight per shipment metric rather, that would mean that orders for our customers' products are starting to increase. There's more widgets for every shipment. And that's what we hope that we'll start seeing sometime soon here early this year. From a cost per shipment standpoint, we saw a moderation in our cost per shipment throughout this year, and that's what we'd anticipated. We originally had expected core inflation this year of 5% to 5.5%, and that's pretty much where we finished. It was higher than that in the first half of the year, better than the average in the second. So I feel like our cost per shipment will likely get back into more consistent with our longer-term average, probably be somewhere around the 4% mark or so. And that 4% plus or minus where we land, obviously, you can do a little bit better than that if you get volume growth and you're getting density and so forth, that drives a lot of operating efficiencies. We've dealt with the opposite over the last year, year and a half. But that number, when you think about it, a lot of our line items, I mentioned the insurance premiums, but we've dealt with significant cost inflation in many of the income statement line items that we have over time. And fortunately, we've been able to improve operating efficiencies and do other things to mitigate that such that our longer-term inflation on a cost per shipment basis has been in that 3.5% to 4% range. Thomas Wadewitz : Right. Okay. Yes, that's all very helpful. Thanks, Adam. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Go ahead. Bascome Majors : Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to follow-up on that last question. Based on the recent contract conversations, you said, certainly, your peers continue to raise price. Do you feel fairly confident you can maintain your historic 1 to 1.5 point spread above that cost inflation this year? Adam Satterfield : Yes. That's always the focus for us. And again, that's why, especially when we get into stronger demand environments. We've historically seen competitors raising rates faster than us. And a lot of that in the past, I think, has been driven by competitors that generally run their networks closer to full utilization. And so if they've not been able to grow volumes in those large upswings, they take advantage of the strength in the market and get more by way of rate. And we like to do both and go back to reference 2018 and 2021, we outgrew the market in those years, 1,000 to 1,200 basis points, meaning on an LTL tons per day basis and we're able to get good consistent yield increases in those years as well. But to us we feel like it's better, it's worked over time to be able to sit across the table from a customer and talk about our cost inflation and say we need cost plus. The plus comes into supporting the long-term consistent investments that we've made in our service center network. We've invested $2 billion in our network over the past 10 years to consistently grow it. And we've increased our door count by about 50% over that last 10-year basis. And right now, there's still some dust to settle, but the 10 years that ended 2022, the industry's number of service centers are down about 10%, at least for the public carrier. So that's something that's created an advantage for us in the marketplace. It's something that we always want to invest in, in capacity, invest in technology that's designed to improve our customer service, to connect to our customers or to be able to drive operating efficiencies for us to keep our cost inflation low. So we're always investing in capacity and technology on behalf of our customers generally, and that's why we've got to build those costs into our price model. But to us, it's a lot easier to sit and say, we want a consistent approach, if you will, versus just something that's more market-driven, trying to get big increases in when the market is in our favor and not as much as the markets in the shipper's favor. It's a formula that's worked over time and it's what we continue to focus on as we go forward. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Good morning gentlemen. How should we think about sort of normal seasonal patterns as we move throughout the year and your year-over-year comparisons with tonnage in terms of when you first started seeing the freight come over from Yellow? Adam Satterfield : Yes. Obviously, it was midyear in the third quarter when they closed and we got that bump. We were at 47,000 shipments per day for the longest time. Jason Seidl : Right. But you didn't see it earlier as they started to bleed a little bit in June? Adam Satterfield : Not really. I mean our monthly average was 47,000 from December of 2022 through July of 2023. So it's flat there, and then we got an initial bump of about 3,000 shipments per day. And we stayed pretty consistent there from around 50,000 or a little bit north of that from August through November and then just had the seasonal drop through December. So as we're starting out, right now, we're a little below January of last year, which as just mentioned, is at 47,000 \u2013 if we get the bump, that the normal seasonal bump, if you will, that would sort of put us flattish with February and March. And then the question will be, are we getting some type of normal seasonality. If so, that would put the second quarter above the second quarter of last year, and then we can kind of go from there, if you will. Jason Seidl : Okay. Makes sense. I want to clarify also something that you guys said. You mentioned you expect an exit of capacity once the dust settles when you were talking about the terminals. Are you talking an exit of capacity from where we are now? Or are you talking a total exit of capacity from when Yellow was an operator? Adam Satterfield : Yes. When Yellow was in operations. I mean, obviously, they had, what, 45,000, 50,000 shipments per day, and they had how many other service centers that they did. And net-net, there's going to be a reduction in those number of service centers that were in operation. There's still quite a few that have not settled in any way. And that's what we had believed. We thought that they would be an exit of some percent of their capacity, if you will. But that same level of freight has got to be moved. And I continue to believe that some of it is currently in the truckload world. And so I think that there'll likely be a second wave of freight that comes into LTL once the overall market is improving, the truckload world is getting back to normal, and if you've got truckload carriers they're looking for any payload and maybe willing to handle a 5,000 to 10,000 pound LTL and try to put multiple large shipments on one trailer together and do multiple stops. That's the type of freight that they will shy away from once the market improves, and will spill right back into the market and become normalized LTL freight again. So I think that that's another unique opportunity probably for 2024 that should provide a little bit of tailwind to everyone. Jason Seidl : Yes. Well, I'm hoping it comes back in 2024 for a normalized market. We all have been waiting for it for quite some time. So fingers crossed. Appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead. Jack Atkins : Okay, great. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess going back to the weight per shipment and just broader demand comment you were making earlier, Adam, I mean, we saw weight per shipment tick up a bit sequentially in the fourth quarter. I know some of that was probably seasonality. But are you starting to see anything, whether it's conversations with customers that would lead you to be a little bit more optimistic about how underlying demand may be trending as we kind of get into the spring. And I guess kind of within that, are you seeing anything different whether it's consumer versus your industrial customer base. Just would be curious about that. Adam Satterfield : Yes, sure. The weight per shipment in the fourth quarter was a little bit stronger than it was in the third, which is fairly typical. And we've seen so far in January, normally, we'd have a drop in weight per shipment of about 2% to 3%. And our weight per shipment is \u2013 right now, it's about 1,515 pounds in January. And so it's dropped a little bit, but better than what the normal seasonal trend would otherwise be from December. So I think that's usually an early indicator on the economy is going to start turning. We try to read all the economic tea leaves and look at things like the inventory to sales ratio and have conversations with customers that would indicate that inventories are normalized, lower than maybe where they should be. And so that causes us to be cautiously optimistic about what may end up coming at us this year, but we still want to be careful about not getting ahead of it after missing it in the spring of 2023. So I certainly feel like there's some opportunity there to see some real recovery in volumes this year, and we'll be prepared for that if it happens. I mentioned that ISM has been below 50 for 14 months. And my goodness, that's just been such a long slow period, the slow cycle is getting as old as Methuselah. We're ready for it to recover, but we've seen that impact in our business levels. Our revenue in the fourth quarter on the industrial side was a little bit slower than the company average. So that, too will be an area of opportunity once we can start seeing some, some improvement there. Jack Atkins : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Eric Morgan with Barclays. Please go ahead. Eric Morgan : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask one on service. You've been kind of been up against the ceiling on claims ratio and on-time performance for some time now. So I guess I'm just wondering what else you can do to improve the customer experience and stay differentiated, particularly as you're looking to maintain your pricing strategy and keep taking share. Not sure if there are opportunities with technology or speed in certain lanes or anything else? Just trying to get a sense for where you're focused outside of those typical metrics we track. Adam Satterfield : Yes. I mean, obviously, the two metrics that we talk about the most are on-time performance and claims ratio. One, it's \u2013 we got to stay focused to make sure that we keep those where they are and make sure as we hire new people as we start growing and things like that, that we don't see those numbers change in any way. So we're always striving for perfection because every shipment we pick up, it's \u2013 we're helping the world keep promises, right? That's a shipment that is going to our customers' customer, and we want to make sure that it's delivered on time and without damage. But when we study the Mastio quality data that we get every year, there's 28 attributes related to service and value that they measure. So obviously, there's much more than just being on time and claims-free. And so we study that data very intently and look at any feedback in areas where we can continue to improve. And we've done that over time, and we're proud that we won 25 of the 28, we were number one in 25 of the 28 Mastio categories in this most recent year. So we're always striving to get better. That's part of our foundation for success is continuous improvement. So we always look for ways and stay engaged with our customers to figure out the things that we can do for them, to drive value, to create win-win scenarios. And so it's just a never ending battle to try to stay ahead of the curve, particularly with respect to technology, so much is changing there, the things that we can do to try to connect more with our customers, drive some automation on the \u2013 in the corporate office and the back end processing and so forth. So a lot of opportunities there to keep improving the customer service experience and also mitigating cost when it comes to our technology investments. Eric Morgan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Stephanie Moore : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to maybe double click a little bit on your commentary on the labor and adding to headcount this year. I just wanted to maybe compare your view on headcount additions for 2024 versus 2023, I think I was under the assumption that in 2023 that you were able to hold on to some labor, kind of protect as many drivers and physicians as possible kind of waiting for the demand to pick up in 2024. So just trying to compare, I think, that commentary from prior quarters to your outlook for this year. Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Sure. And we did have some attrition as we work through 2023. So the overall headcount has been lower on a quarter-over-quarter basis as we went through the year. And like I mentioned, in the fourth quarter, in particular, the average headcount was down 4% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, but it was up compared to the third quarter of this year. And so we're adding some positions. We're just under 23,000 employees was our average for the fourth quarter, and that compares back to \u2013 we were 24,000, 25,000 average full-time employees back in parts of 2022. So it will be shipment driven. Typically, when you look at long-term changes in our shipments per day and long-term changes in our headcount. Those two numbers are very closely aligned. And so you're exactly right. We were trying to hang on to as many people as we could, particularly our drivers that we've invested so much in, as we progress through this last year, 1.5 years of slower economic times, and that gave us an advantage. I mentioned this earlier, but we had employees that have their CDLs and they were working primarily on the dock. And when we saw that positive inflection in volumes back in the third quarter, that was something that we were easily able to tap into and put those folks right back into a truck. So that worked to our advantage. We're running our truck driving schools right now to continue to produce more employees that have their CDLs, and will be available to drive as demand continues to improve. So that's why we're always trying to keep our focus on the long-term and be prepared for when the demand gets strong and we start seeing the levels of shipment growth like we've been able to experience in the past, back in 2021, we grew shipments per day at 19.5% at that year, our competition was up 4%. And we were able to accommodate that 19% shipment growth, and be able to keep our service metrics best-in-class and so forth. And it's that investment and trying to stay ahead of the curve with all the things that we do, with all three elements of capacity that allows us to put on significant levels of growth like that when the demand environment dictates. Stephanie Moore : Got it. And just as a quick follow-up, seeing any difficulties meeting some of those hiring or headcount additions thus far this year? Just trying to get a sense of the strength of the labor environment? Adam Satterfield : Not at this point. And again, we're trying to get ahead of it a little bit in the sense of creating some of our own drivers. But I think right now, just the state of the market overall, it's totally different than, compare and contrast to 2021, when things were so tight everywhere, and it was more of a challenge to get drivers. That's why we focus so much on keeping everyone that we could through the slow period, but go ahead and starting our schools back up, well ahead of the growth coming at us. We want to make sure that particularly with respect to drivers that we get ahead of it as best we can. Stephanie Moore : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning. So just maybe a bigger picture question. Adam, someone asked about pricing earlier, and you answered, well, based on normal seasonality, here's what yields would look like. And I would have thought maybe with this big Yellow event that maybe would be better than normal seasonality on pricing. And same thing, right, where Yellow has gone and tonnage is still down. And so I guess, ultimate question is we all treated Yellow as this really, really big event in the industry. Is it not really a big event? Or is it that \u2013 it's a really big deal, but it's all being masked by slow macro and ultimately, whenever the macro gets better, we'll really feel the impact of Yellow and it's all still sort of on the come? Adam Satterfield : Yes, I certainly think it's \u2013 the macro being in the state that it is, that helped the carriers absorb the freight that they were hauling before and pretty effectively. And \u2013 but like I mentioned, I think some of that freight has gone into some different modes and believe that, that will be short lived until really demand improves overall for transportation in general. But \u2013 now when it comes to pricing and just the yield improvement that we've had, we have incredibly strong yield performance in 2021, followed that up with 2022. And then our rev per hundredweight ex-fuel was up 8.1% this year. So some of that, like I mentioned, has been mix driven, but we've had really strong yield performance really over the last three years. But we've said even during that time, that our strategy is what it is. And we think it has worked for us. And when we operate at 72% for the year, I don't know that anyone else will be anywhere close to that. And so \u2013 but it's just a disciplined focus of keeping our costs as low as we can, and then pricing, understanding our cost on a per customer basis and then having a yield that makes sense to try to constantly improve the profitability on each customer account. But we've never said that, that was the right long-term rate. We just want to be consistent and be fair with our customers in that 100 basis points to 150 basis points positive spread of yield above cost has worked for us. But we were in a much different position than a lot of other carriers, I think, in terms of that long-term consistency that we've had in our pricing, we didn't have the same need to go out and try to take advantage of that market change and really increase rates in any way. We kept the same measured, fair approach. And I think that pays dividends. I think it is a reason why we've had good volume stability as well when we've gone through this last slow period, is that we've got good customer relationships. Freight at the end of the day is a relationship business, and so we want to continue to strengthen relationships and we've got an understanding with our customer base in terms of what we're trying to achieve. And you work through a slow year, we really didn't have any major customer losses. We didn't lose lanes from customers. We kept most of our large national accounts as we progress through the year, just the volume weakness was a result of \u2013 there were reduced orders for our customers' products. So pleased with the customer retention that we had last year and look forward to demand improves for our customers' products, we're in place and we'll be able to bring on that freight into the truck line. And get back to doing what we do best, which is growth. Scott Group : That's helpful. I know we're past here. If I can just sneak in one more. I'm just looking at this like, 2022, you guys bought back a lot of stock at the lows and your pace of buybacks have really slowed the last couple of quarters, sort of with the stock at the high. So you've had a pretty good feel for your stock. How are you thinking about your buyback this year? Adam Satterfield : Well, we'll have the same approach that we always do. We start looking at what we think our cash from operations will be and then what we're going to spend with capital expenditures. And then we have the fixed dividend component. And the net cash balance, we target trying to return to shareholders through the buyback program. But we generally have a grid-based approach where we're buying more when the stock is lower, and I mean, less when it's higher, but consistently in the market. And I think that's what you've seen. But that $1.3 billion was double what we spent, about $600 million the year prior. And so it was reduced this year in the back half, in particular. But as we go into 2024, we'll just continue to look at how much free cash we think that we'll have and how much we try to return to shareholders and in what ways as we go through the year such that we don't obviously want too much cash building up on the balance sheet. But it's all about driving returns on invested capital, and we've done a pretty good job over time, with improving that metric. Scott Group : Thank you, Adam. Adam Satterfield : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Today's last question comes from James Monigan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. James Monigan : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Actually, I want to follow-up on Scott's question. Like, about sort of the yields versus seasonality and pricing versus seasonality. You've mentioned that the market sort of moved pricing up and your competitors have been aggressive on that. And you have improved or have strong service. And so has that like sort of fair price moved away from where it is now? And is there a bit of a catch-up trade on price across the remainder of the year relative to service, based on where everybody else is in the market? Adam Satterfield : I'm not sure that I fully understand your question, but like I mentioned before, that we anticipated that, that metric would eventually compress back to longer-term averages. And for us, it's 100 basis points to 150 basis points positive spread, which by the way, reconciles to the average operating ratio improvement, we've been able to generate over time as well. And so we'll continue to do our best to manage our cost and to continue to ask for necessary increases on our customer accounts to offset the cost inflation that we'll have in the business and to support the wage increases that we give to our employees to allow us to retain the employees that we have, but continue to attract new employees to our business as well, which we've been able to do over time to support the consistent growth that we've been able to produce. So it takes a lot to keep growing the company year in and year out. And to be able to keep our cost inflation as we're doing so as well. So try to keep that cost under control and keep asking for that same positive spread over time, that's what our focus is going to be. James Monigan : Yes. And just real quick on a percentage basis, how much do you expect to grow doors this coming year or any other measure of capacity? Adam Satterfield : Well, we've probably got line of sight into adding four or five service centers. As Marty mentioned, we've got several that have been under construction. But a lot of that will really depend on the volume environment as well. In the past, we've finished service centers and may complete the construction, we have to start depreciating them and incurring other overhead-type costs with them, but if the volumes don't dictate the opening, then we might sort of keep them in ready reserve, if you will, and wait until volumes are stronger to start incurring the cost because with growth, that's another incremental cost, every new service center that we opened. You've got incremental line-haul cost and other expenses that we're going to incur as a result of that opening. In addition to just the general depreciation and overhead. So that will be something that we'll be mindful of as we go through the year. And hopefully, the volume environment will be such that we're ready to open them and turn them on day one as soon as we're finished. James Monigan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Marty Freeman for closing remarks. Kevin Freeman : Thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions, and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Marty Freeman, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, for opening remarks. Marty, please go ahead, sir. Kevin Freeman : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter conference call this morning. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. And after some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion's financial results improved during the first quarter of 2024 despite the continued softness in the domestic economy.  While the improvement in our results was modest, we produced year-over-year increases in both revenue and earnings per diluted share for the second straight quarter. Our earnings per diluted share of $1.34 also represents a new company record for the first quarter. To produce these results, our OD family of employees continued to execute on long-term strategic plan that helped create one of the strongest records of growth and profitability in the LTL industry.  This was evidenced by our team's ability to once again deliver 99% on-time service and a 0.1 cargo claims ratio for the first quarter. Consistently delivering superior service at a fair price is the central element of our strategic plan, and we have created a best-in-class value proposition as a result. This value proposition continues to create opportunities for us to win market share over the long term and has also helped strengthen our customer relationships.  Our customer retention trends have remained steady over the past 2 years despite a domestic economy that has been sluggish for longer than we originally anticipated. Our customers have had fewer shipments to give us as a result of the slower economic environment, but we are strongly positioned to respond to their needs when demand eventually improves.  Demand can quickly -- can very quickly change in the LTL industry and the OD team has experience in dealing with these challenges that rapid growth can present. This is why we focus so intently on our long-term market share initiatives and make decisions to help us achieve these goals despite the cost implications that may impact us at the short term.  Our capital expenditure program is a prime example of this, as we have invested $757.3 million in total capital expenditures in 2023 and expect to spend approximately $750 million this year to stay ahead of our growth curve. The resulting depreciation has recreated some short-term cost headwinds that slightly impacted our first quarter operating ratio, but we have improved our fleet and also have approximately 30% excess capacity in our service center network to support future growth. The LTL industry has seen significant disruption over the past 9 months, but we believe the strategic advantages that we have allowed us to outgrow our industry for decades and will continue. Other carriers may be able to add service centers or purchase more equipment, but what has differentiated us from other carriers is not so easy to duplicate, which is our culture and our OD family spirit.  Our people are the most important element of our strategic plan and our entire OD family of employees is committed to a culture of excellence. We invest significantly in our employees to help ensure that we are regularly educating and training our team. We have trained most 1/3 of our current drivers through our internal OD truck driving training program, and we intend to keep using this program to produce safe and qualified drivers. We also continue to invest in our management and sales training programs, which we believe will help produce the next generation of OD leaders. These are additional examples of decisions that create short-term costs, but are more willing to incur these costs to be prepared for our future. Our consistent investments in our people, our service and our network are the key reasons why we have one more market share than any other carrier over the past 10 years. Having each of these elements in place is also why we continue to believe that we are the best positioned company in the LTL industry to benefit from an improving economy.  Delivering superior service is ultimately what wins market share in our industry. And I can assure you that everyone on OD's team is more committed than ever to deliver superior service to our customers and ultimately add value to our supply chains.  We also have the financial strength and consistent returns to support investments needed to help achieve our long-term vision for profitable growth. As we continue to execute on a proven plan to achieve this vision, we believe we can drive further improvement in shareholder value.  Thank you for joining us this morning. And now Adam will discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Marty, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $1.5 billion, which was a 1.2% increase from the prior year. This slight increase in revenue was primarily due to a 4.1% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight was partially offset by the 3.2% decrease in LTL tons per day.  Our quarterly operating ratio increased 10 basis points to 73.5% as compared to last year, while our earnings per diluted share increased 3.9% to $1.34. On a sequential basis, our revenue per day for the first quarter decreased 7.0% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 with LTL tons per day decreasing 5.5% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 5.2%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes a decrease of 1.3% in revenue per day, a decrease of 1.0% in tons per day and a decrease of 0.3% in shipments per day. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the first quarter were as follows : January decreased 3.9% as compared to December. February increased 1.9% from January, and March increased 2.4% as compared to February.  The 10-year average change for these respective months is an increase of 0.8% in January, an increase of 1.5% in February and an increase of 4.8% in March. Please remember, however, that Good Friday was in March this year, and the average sequential change for March when that is the case, is an increase of 2.5%. While there are still a few work days remaining in April, our month-to-date revenue per day has increased by approximately 5.5% to 6% when compared to April of 2023. Our LTL tonnage per day has increased by approximately 2% to 2.5%, while LTL revenue per hundredweight has increased by approximately 4%. Our LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, has increased approximately 4.5%, which is trending lower than our growth rate in the first quarter.  We want to be clear that the slowdown in this metric does not represent any change in our pricing philosophy or a change in the overall pricing environment. Certain mix changes are impacting this metric in April as the change in our LTL revenue per shipment is more comparable with the first quarter. Nevertheless, we will continue with our long-term consistent approach of targeting yield improvements that exceed our cost inflation and support our capital expenditure program, and we believe we can achieve those initiatives this year. We will provide the actual revenue-related details for April in our first quarter Form 10-Q as usual.  Our operating ratio increased 10 basis points to 73.5% for the first quarter of 2024, as the impact from the increase in our overhead cost more than offset the improvement rather than our direct costs. Many of our fixed overhead costs increased as a percent of revenue due to the flatness in revenue and the significance of our capital expenditures over the past year. This is most evidenced by the 50 basis point increase in our depreciation cost as a percent of revenue. We are pleased, however, that the improvement in yield and ongoing focus on operating efficiencies helped us improve our direct operating cost as a percent of revenue by approximately 100 basis points. This change included improvements in our operating supplies and expenses that offset a slight increase in salaries, wages and benefits as a percent of revenue.  Our team continued to efficiently manage our variable costs while also delivering best-in-class service standards, which is not easy to do in an environment with lower operating density. We continued to believe that the keys to long-term operating ratio improvement are the combination of density and yield, both of which generally require a favorable macroeconomic environment.  Once we have those factors working in our favor again, we are confident in our ability to produce further improvement in our operating ratio and we'll continue to work towards our goal of producing a sub-70% annual operating ratio. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $423.9 million for the first quarter, while capital expenditures were $119.5 million. We utilized $85.3 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the first quarter, while cash dividends totaled $56.6 million.  Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 25.6% as compared to 25.8% for the first quarter of 2023. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25.4% for the second quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we're happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : So great summary of where we got to this point. Is 2Q the quarter where kind of we see the best of what this industry looks like in a post yellow environment, and if tonnage picks up and you have 2024 pricing that comes in, kind of how do we expect 2Q to trend versus seasonality? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I think that's a difficult one to answer. It's obviously dependent on the top line. Typically, the second quarter is when we see the big acceleration in revenue and historically speaking, the 10-year average increase in revenue from the first to the second quarter is 8.7%. And we're not starting out with that type of growth in April. Things still feel good to us, and we're finally seeing some year-over-year revenue growth, but it's not quite at the levels of getting back to seasonality. We have been encouraged that we've seen our volumes increasing really into February, into March and have essentially increased thus far into April, but again, not at what those normal seasonal levels are.  So to kind of frame up the second quarter operating ratio guidance, it's going to be very dependent on what the top line does. If you think about last year at this point in time, we were at a point where we weren't looking at any sequential revenue growth, and we were targeting margins to be flat. If we were able to grow at what the normal seasonal levels would be on the top line, that would be that 8.7%, sequential growth would be about 12% year-over-year growth.  So obviously, we're ways away from that. Where we are at this sort of 6%, I would say we probably are somewhere in the middle of that sliding scale. If we were to stay at 6% year-over-year growth, then I would probably put us somewhere at a target of maybe about 150 basis points of improvement from the first quarter.  So like always, the second quarter is going to be dependent upon how much acceleration we see. And we're not -- while we're encouraged by some things, we're not ready to make the call to say that things are definitely accelerating and that we can hit some of those sequential points as we go through May and June. But obviously, hopefully, we'll continue to see some acceleration there, and that will create operating density for us and will allow us to improve our margin from the first quarter to the second. Operator : The next question comes from Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Unknown Analyst : This is Grant on for Daniel. There was a comment in the release around some recent developments that suggest overall demand for your services may be improving. Could you maybe just provide a little more context around what that comment was referring to? Is it more a weight per shipment comment that is maybe impacting some of your yield metrics April that you discussed earlier? And maybe if you could also just provide a bit of an update on the underlying demand environment. Adam Satterfield : Yes, I would say right now, underlying domain has felt relatively consistent, but it does feel like things are improving a bit. And obviously, like I just mentioned, we've seen some sequential acceleration obviously, January, we see pretty good with winter weather, and we saw the impact of that. But we increased from there through February and then saw again some of the sequential improvement in shipments through March and thus far into April.  But I feel like there are several factors that are starting to turn. We've been at -- and a long slow cycle for going back to April '22. And maybe to borrow a line from Taylor Swift is that over now, we're kind of waiting to see, but we saw ISM inflect back above 50% for the first time. Like you mentioned, our weight per shipment has increased again. We saw a little bit of a change from January to February. It dropped a little bit, but then it came back in March and at this point through April, we're up a little bit higher. So you sort of balance that with conversations that we've had from customers and we look at our national account reporting on wins and losses.  There's a lot of good things that feel like they're developing. And if history repeats itself, usually a couple of months after that ISM reflect -- or inflects to the positive, we start seeing some improvement in our industrial activity as well. And that's something that will steal on our retail outperformed our industrial business in the first quarter.  So if that's something that we can start seeing some recovery there, all of those things and factors hopefully will be increasing the demand for LTL service. And we're certainly in a position to take advantage of that opportunity as it presents itself. Operator : The next question comes from Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Jordan Alliger : Just curious if you could talk to a little bit more the yield side of the equation, perhaps a little more color around mix, core pricing you're seeing as your contracts come up? And I guess, broadly, is this any way -- is the yield deceleration -- I don't know, is it tied in some way to more intense competition out there given industry spare capacity? Adam Satterfield : Yes. That's why we wanted to be clear with the comments earlier that we don't see this in any way as being a reflection on the overall environment. And certainly, there is no change with respect to what our yield management initiatives are. We continue to target trying to achieve yield improvement that ultimately leads to our revenue per shipment outperforming our cost per shipment.  That's something we've been able to achieve and we've targeted 100 to 150 basis points in the past. And obviously, with the weakness in the volume environment over the past year, we weren't able to achieve that positive spread in 2023, but we kept on investing and that's created more costs, and we're continuing to invest this year.  I do think we're getting close back to this point and perhaps it will inflect back in the second quarter to where we do see a positive spread, probably not to that full 100 to 150 basis point delta. But I do think that we can see our revenue per shipment now going back above what our cost per shipment change would otherwise be.  But we're continuing to work through contracts as they're coming due. We're winning some new business. Sometimes that can come on board when you look at things on a hundredweight basis, that number can skew and be skewed by multiple factors, be it the weight per shipment, the length of haul, which has been decreasing, the class of freight as well.  There's multiple things that can move that number around and the year-over-year growth is just a little bit slower in April than where we were in the first quarter. But our revenue per shipment overall is what matters the most, and that's performing pretty consistent with where we were in the first quarter, at least from a core basis, it's a little bit higher right now, including the fuel.  But on a core basis, looking at revenue per shipment ex fuel, pretty close to where we were in the first quarter. So -- and I still feel good about the environment and certainly seeing the activity that we've had internally and the increases that we continue to achieve, we feel good about things and especially the line of sight to seeing some positive spread once again of rev per ship outperforming the cost per ship. Operator : The next question comes from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Bascome Majors : I think your long-term shareholders can be happy with the discipline you've held through this 2-year protracted down cycle on sticking to your guidance and strategy and waiting to really monetize the capacity in the better part of the cycle in the future here, especially with all the changes in the competitive landscape and capacity moving around at some of your peers.  But as you look forward and wait for that inflection, are there things you are looking for in that the market may have changed and the strategy does require a tweak here or there? I'm just curious internally what you're watching for to see that things may have shifted in some way, shape or form in the way that customers are viewing OD. Adam Satterfield : Yes. I think certainly, time will tell and it's something that we continue to watch. And the business levels, our market share trends. All of those are pretty much have been in line with what we would have otherwise expected when we go through a slower economic environment. It's something where our market share is generally flattish and a little hard to track market share right now with the disruption post Yellow's closure.  And maybe the way I look at it is slightly different than the way some of you do. But if I compare at least what we have from a fourth quarter reporting where all the other carriers have reported, it looks like we're in really good shape with -- if you compare back to the second quarter, so kind of before and after that event. And we've gained some market share relative to the other public carriers combined. And the largest carrier in the space has gained the most shipments again, second quarter to the fourth quarter, not looking at just a year-over-year percent change but pre-event, post event they have, and then there's one other carrier that's grown about the same as us, just a little bit higher shipments per day.  And then all of the other public carriers are pretty flat when you look otherwise. And so a lot of what we have seen historically is similar types of trends. And then when the economy starts inflecting back to the positive, that's the time when OD's model shines the brightest, and we think that will happen once again. Once we get some economic recovery, if you will, some real economic improvement where we've been running against the wind for the past 2 years, we get some tailwind from the economy, I think you will see that volume growth come through our network and we'll be able to leverage that improvement in operating density to drive that with improved operating ratio.  So we don't believe at this point that anything will be any different. Like Marty said earlier, we're really pleased with our customer retention trends. The way that we've seen business levels change over the past 1.5 years, and it's been slower. We're in place and ready to respond to our customers' needs when they see their businesses [ inflecting ] back to the positive. So all the things are in place. We just need a little bit more improvement in the underlying freight demand environment to capitalize on it and certainly feel like we're closer to that event changing and that inflection point, and there have been some green shoots that if you're looking at things from a glass half full kind of standpoint, which I typically do, that you can read through and see some potential opportunity for perhaps later this year.  And so we're definitely in place. We feel like all the pieces are there. And we said it earlier, anyone can go out and you can buy terminals, you can buy equipment. But the thing that differentiates us the most is our people and our culture. And those are things that cannot be duplicated, certainly not in any short period of time. And I think the commitment that we have from each of our employees to excellence and delivering superior service for our customers is what will allow OD's model to continue to shine into the future and allow us to achieve our long-term market share initiatives. Operator : The next question comes from Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Adam, I just wanted to go back to the OR comment on the second quarter. I mean, it's -- if I just look at revenue per day, I assume it should accelerate given maybe easier comps rest of the quarter. So you're growing maybe revenue mid- to high single digits in the second quarter. And so the implied incrementals on that are like 25% to 30% to get to OR in 2Q? And I would just imagine with all the pricing that's been taken in the industry and the front-end loaded nature of the cost, like we could do better than that. I don't know if that's a fair view or not, but I'd love to get your opinion on that.  And then maybe more higher level on the OR, you've got, I think, right now, probably 18% of your revenue is direct cost, if I'm doing my calculations right, and it's been as low as maybe 16%, so you got a couple of hundred basis points there. And then there's obviously leverage on mix and variable costs. Can you just talk about kind of the levers to improve margins over the next couple of years if we do get a recovery because there is this view that there's not much more to go when you're already doing a 72, 73 OR. Adam Satterfield : Well, if you remember, we have done a 69.6 and a 69.1 in the second and third quarters of 2022 when we had more revenue growth going on and felt like we had room to go from there. So nothing's changed with respect to where we feel like we can take the operating ratio long term, which is part of the reason why we repeated the goal of being able to achieve a sub-70 annual operating ratio.  But there's a few things to try to unpack from that question. And I would say that when we're initially in the upswing, get into the environment where we start seeing revenue growth again, eventually, when you get into it, that's periods of higher incremental margins for us, but you got to get to the point where you've got enough revenue to kind of recover some of the fixed overhead costs that -- and the growth, improvement or increase rather in some of the other variable costs that go along with preparing for growth.  And we've already instituted some of those costs. For example, we've added about 500 people since September of last year. We were averaging 51,000 shipments per day in September last year, and now we're at about 48,000. So we've tried to continue to do all the things to get ahead of anticipated growth, and we're having to manage all of those costs, and we do. We manage the efficiency of all elements of our operation and trying to manage and match all of those costs with our revenue trends. But I would say that the uncertainty for the second quarter is just whether or not revenue will continue to accelerate or what we end up seeing if we continue to improve from here, that's going to be an improvement in operating density, and that will drive further improvement in our direct cost performance.  If you pull our operating ratio in the first quarter apart, I think you may have said it in the inverse, but our direct cost, which are all the costs associated with moving freight, most of which are variable, we're about 53% of revenue. Our overhead costs, which are more fixed in nature, is between 20% to 21% of revenue.  So those costs are somewhere around $300 million, a little bit higher than that in the first quarter. That $300 million is going to be there in the second quarter and it's probably going to be closer to $305 million, plus or minus. So you've kind of got that base cost to bounce around. But on -- and those being at 20% to 21% to one of your other points, yes, that's been as low as 16% in the past when you're really leveraging up, in particular, all the investments that we've made in capital expenditures and driving improvement there.  On the direct cost side, though, that 53% just as late as the third quarter of last year, those costs were around 51%. And that was still in a tough operating environment. So we definitely have got further room for improvement from a direct cost basis. And then obviously, there's a lot of leverage there on the overhead side. And those factors are what gives us confidence that we can get the operating ratio back to sub-70.  But we're not going to make decisions that would help cost in the short run that may jeopardize the opportunity in the long run. The reason we've been able to outgrow our competitors in strong growth periods like 2018, 2021, where our tonnage growth can be 1,000 basis points or more higher than the industry is because of the decisions we make in tougher times. We've got the financial strength to be able to invest in service center growth to be able to invest in our equipment to invest in employees and do all the things to be ready for that growth. And that's why oftentimes in those strongest growth periods, we're growing double-digit volumes and a lot of our competitors are flattish in those periods. So all those same strategic advantages, the pre-investment ahead of the growth curve, all of those continue to be in place, and we'll get the most leverage on them when we get into a real accelerating and growth environment again. Amit Mehrotra : But Adam, if I could just quickly follow up on that for a second because the strategy seems to be we're going to sit around and wait for somebody to get screw up, and that's when the market share opportunity is going to come. And that maybe have been the case in the last 10 or 15 years, but what's plan B? Like what happens if no national player screws up because everybody is focused on service and they actually deliver, what is the plan of action then? Adam Satterfield : Look, we're not just sitting back doing nothing. We're fighting every day to get better and working with each one of our customer accounts to make sure that we're in there. We're having conversations about how we're going to be able to grow with them. But we also don't have to feel the need to go out and try to chase volume, which many of competitors have done in the past, and then they get their network full and they're unable to grow.  So the point that I was making earlier about there's not been as much growth when you look at what has happened sequentially over the last couple of quarters from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.  I mean, when you look, I see that our share has improved from second quarter to fourth quarter, from third quarter to fourth quarter as well. So we're doing this in an environment that is not creating a lot of freight activity. I think that when we get out of this environment, I think that the time to challenge our model would be if we're in an environment where there is robust economic growth, and we're not able to achieve anything, but we are a long ways from there. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Morgan of Barclays. Eric Morgan : I wanted to follow up on the demand environment and in particular, how you would characterize the depth of this to your slumping volumes because obviously, the industry is underperformed industrial production quite a bit since early '22. But if we benchmark 2019 and try to kind of look through the pandemic, both are kind of somewhat flat. So just curious if we think we've overcorrected and could see a bit of a catch-up on the upside, if there is some macro improvement? Or if you think maybe we're more an equilibrium now and should see more of kind of industrial production type growth from here? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I mean certainly in the past 2 years have felt more like 2009 recession. When you look back last year and see double-digit tonnage in some periods and overall for the year, we were down 9%. It was a very tough operating environment. But again, we continue to try to power through it and position ourselves for future market share opportunities. And I think that's what we've done, managing all of our other incremental costs along the way to keep producing what is by far and away the best operating ratio in our industry. And so I think that when you get back to an environment where transportation in general, the truckload market, in particular, has been incredibly weak.  And I think there has been some spillover of volumes that have gone into that industry, just given the overall weakness there and players that are willing to move freight take some maybe large heavy-weighted LTL shipments for cost or less than their cost to operate just to kind of keep the trucks rolling. That's been another challenge, if you will, that we've had to contend with.  But that will all change as the economy improves, just like we've seen in prior cycles. And I think that our industry will be tight once again. I continue to believe that despite some other carriers adding service centers that we will be a capacity challenged industry in the future as well.  And ultimately, all of the service centers and door capacities that existed with Yellow, not 100% of that is going to come back into the market, as we've already seen with the process that it's played out over the last 9 months.  So those are all things that we think will end up creating opportunities for us, again, and I think that once we have that tailwind coming at us from an overall industry demand standpoint that we'll be able to capitalize and be able to significantly grow our volumes like we've been able to do in the past and then leverage that growth through the operating ratio.  And if you look back in any period in past, when we've lost the operating ratio in any given year or period and go back to 2009 and look at that, we lost -- the operating ratio deteriorated 270 basis points that year. Once we get the power of leverage in the model, we more than recover anything that we've lost. In that example, in 2010, when things really were robust again, we were able to improve the OR by 360 basis points.  So I feel like though from getting to the improvement cycle that it feels similar to 2017, where things are kind of on the edge of getting ready to start showing improvement again. And hopefully, we'll continue to see some growth as we go through the middle part of the year, some year-over-year growth and further sequential improvement and then things really start taking off and we'll go from there.  But that's -- the good thing about our mid-quarter updates is we're going to give it to you as we go along. So you'll see the final April results we'll put in our 10-Q, the final May results from a revenue standpoint will publish. And you'll know it is developing versus me having to look through the crystal ball and predict when we're going to see the big inflection in revenue coming. Operator : The next question comes from Bruce Chan of Stifel. J. Bruce Chan : Jack, congrats and Adam, I didn't take you for a Swiftie, but maybe if I can borrow a line from her as well, just a question about the tortured pricing department here. We've heard from a couple of shippers that there's one last push going on for lower rates, especially some of those that may be negotiated in the first quarter of '23. And kind of felt like they missed a little bit of the ride there. Have you seen any of that? And specifically, have you seen any pull forward in bid activity early in the year? Any extra color on the pricing trends for this year, certainly helpful. Adam Satterfield : Yes. I've got a teenage daughter, so I can't help but hear certain types of music in the house. But on the pricing front, we've not really seen any material change in activity or bid activity. And for us, it's pretty consistent through the year in terms of how bids come in. And so pretty much just business as usual there. And again, like we said earlier, continuing to get the same types of increases on a core basis that we've seen in the past. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Unknown Analyst : This is Adam [ Rusckowski ] on for Ken Hoexter. The team and Jack, I hope the other side is treating you well. So why don't you get back to the excess capacity comment you noted about 30%. Could you remind us of the current capacity expansion plan maybe in the near term or over the next couple of years? And then average headcount was up slightly sequentially. How should we think about the headcount run rate for the balance of the year? And maybe could this serve as a potential cost lever? Adam Satterfield : Yes. From a headcount standpoint, I mentioned that we've added about 500 people since September of last year. So I feel like we're in good shape there. The other thing is that we are running our truck driving schools. And so some of the people that we pulled from a platform position and put them into a truck in the fall to respond to that sequential acceleration in business, we've been able to backfill those platforms roles with the hiring, but also have trained more drivers to have those employees and drivers and ready reserve, if you will, to respond to an increase in demand if it continues to accelerate from here. So it's pretty much in balance right now with the change in full-time employees with shipments. And that's something that generally is balanced over the long term. But I feel like we try to get a little bit ahead of it, but we're cautiously optimistic about and has been for the last quarter. So that was why we went ahead and tried to invest there in that employee growth, but we'll continue to watch and we're a little bit ahead of it.  We've got different levers that we can pull if volumes are accelerating to where you don't have to hire on a one-for-one basis with growth. But we're in a good spot. May be kind of flattish from here. But depending on we see further acceleration coming through, say, now to anticipate through September, then that might require some further hiring. But no real immediate need at this point to do anything in a material way. I feel like our employee count is pretty well balanced with the volumes that we're seeing. Maybe Marty will address the service center capacity. Kevin Freeman : Yes. From a capacity standpoint, we always try to maintain at least 25%. And with the 30% that we have now, some of that comes from what we started as a -- enlarging some of our docs that we had experienced some tight door pressure in which we keep a door pressure report going on a monthly basis. But some of those things are finishing up from expansions in 2022, that's the reason for the 30%.  But we always try to keep excess capacity because we're confident this economy is going to turn for us and if not this year, beginning in next year. So there's nothing worse than getting an influx and promises from customers for additional business and not having enough capacity to handle it. So that's why we try to keep that 25% to 30% at all times. Operator : The next question comes from Stephanie Moore of Jefferies. Joseph Lawrence Hafling : This is Joe Hafling on for Stephanie. I hate to ask again on the capacity question, but you've mentioned a couple of times how you think that the strategy of the past would continue to work and the environment itself will become tight. But with sort of all the rest of the national players essentially copying the Old Dominion playbook and trying to keep a 20% to 30% excess capacity figure themselves, how are you thinking about keeping incremental capacity or adding incremental capacity? And do you think that the industry overall today with everybody trying to be like Old Dominion, does that lead to the industry just having excess capacity more than there ever was in the prior decade? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I think that at the end of the day, capacity is not what wins business. It allows you to achieve market share initiatives. So having capacity doesn't necessarily mean that anyone is going to be able to grow, it just gives the ability to grow. Service is ultimately what wins share and relationships in this business as well. And I think that we've been able to strengthen our customer relationships over time, our sales and our pricing teams, the relationships that they formed with our customers, the consistency of our business practices, the consistency of our yield management practices as well. All that goes into forming strong bonds between us and our customers.  And so we continue to look at ways that we can add further value to our customers' supply chains. And we look for ways that we can continue to execute on a continuous improvement process, which is a central element of our foundation for success. So we've got a better service product than anyone else in our industry. We're proud that we've won the Mastio Quality Award for 14 years in a row and the service gap between us and the others actually got wider in last year's analysis.  So that's something that we remain focused on and keep trying to do things that our customers are asking from us and to be able to deliver that superior service at a fair price to our customers as well. So the competition that is trying to emulate us, I guess that's one to say about imitation being the most sincere form of flattery.  We'll continue to watch and see what they're doing, but it's something that people have been trying to emulate for years, and we're not sitting still to let someone try to come up and catch us. We're working hard every day to get better to make sure that, that service gap and the overall value gap that we add continues to get wider. Joseph Lawrence Hafling : Great. And then maybe just on that point, have you heard any maybe anecdotes from customers lately on any service issues? Or is the environment just still too weak right now, so that's really become an issue? Adam Satterfield : I haven't heard anything out of the ordinary, things that we wouldn't normally hear. But the reporting -- we've had some improvement in our -- the national account reporting that we get with wins and losses. And service issues are starting to increase, I would just say, generally. We're starting to see those start to pick up. So just something that's kind of on the press pace of one other item that's kind of changing in our favor. Operator : The next question comes from Jason Seidl of TD Cowen. Jason Seidl : A couple of quick questions here. Number one, when we're thinking about sort of either the tonnage or market share, it seems that pre-pandemic, it was more of a just-in-time supply chain, and that shifted a little bit to just in case now. It seems like we're probably moving back a little bit more towards the JIT. Is this something that just sort of favors your operational model and service standards? And if it does, should we expect you to sort of get back to sort of the old ways of Old Dominion of sort of being the market share leader? Adam Satterfield : Yes, I think so, Jason, I agree with you. And I felt like post-pandemic, we were going to stay in more of an adjusting case type of inventory management style. But once things get tight and you start managing cost, you have to look at all elements and managing tighter inventory is one way for shippers to improve their overall bottom line.  And so we've seen that trend kind of work its way back to the JIT. And we've had anecdotal feedback from customers that have come in and visited us as well that may have had elevated inventory levels that they have now worked through. So hopefully, that will be a good thing for us.  And it generally is, obviously, if you're managing tighter inventory, you've got to rely on a shipper that can deliver on time and without damage. If you don't have excess inventory sitting around, you can't afford to have a shipment come in that's completely damaged and you've got to deal with a return and reorder type of situation.  And so that has supported our ability to win market share over time. It's something that we think will continue to allow us to win market share as we go forward and it works both with our industrial and our retail customers. But on the retail side, with the on-demand and in full programs that many retailers have put in place to manage their inventory, that's a tremendous opportunity for continued growth in our business as well.  And we're able to meet the expectations of those retailers and take the vendor-controlled freight and make sure that we hit those delivery windows, and we're doing at 99% of the time and without any type of damage. So we're minimizing in some cases, millions of dollars of chargebacks for retail-related customers that are delivering into those big box retailers with those on-time and full programs in place.  So a lot of good opportunity when we look down the long-term curve, and it's why we're so confident in our ability to keep winning market share into the future. I feel like we continue to have a long runway for growth. And that's what dictates and determines our capital expenditure program. We look at where we see growth coming from, a lot of that is based on customer conversations that we're having for how their business levels are going to be changing into the future as well and that dictates how we continue to expand out our network.  So as long as we have line of sight into the next 5 years of growth, and that's generally what we're kind of pre-investing for, we will continue to invest the money into our real estate program and further expand the service center network. But it's all grounded on a line of sight in the market share opportunities. It's not just a build it and hope they come. Jason Seidl : Right. That makes sense. And if I can just follow up with a clarification something. You talked about your growth rates month-to-date in April. But did I miss -- did you guys give how that compares to historical averages? Adam Satterfield : In terms on a sequential standpoint or... Jason Seidl : Yes, because I think you mentioned the sequential gain in tonnage in April, but I don't know if I missed the historical average comp. Adam Satterfield : Yes. So far, I mean, obviously, we're not completely done, but we're somewhere around 48,000 shipments per day. So just up slightly from where we were in March. And we'll see hopefully, that will increase a little bit that average count, if you will. But when we look at what normal seasonality, the 10-year average is a 0.4% increase from March into April for shipments.  But recall that we had a Good Friday is in there in March this year. So in years where that is the case, it would be a 2% increase from March to April. So right now, trending lower than that 2% growth, but when you look back at kind of what we were able to achieve in February and March, again, consistent growth.  And on the tonnage side, we saw just call it 2% sequential growth from January to February and then about 2.5% from February to March, demonstrating a little bit of pickup in weight per shipment there that kind of help that metric. And that metric was essentially in alignment with the 10-year average or rather the adjusted average that reflects Good Friday being in March.  So it's good to see that we're finally seeing month-over-month improvement there versus I've mentioned before from April of '22 through December, we were kind of in a declining environment and then just flat from December at 47,000 shipments per day, December '22, all the way to August when we had the big industry event and that acceleration that we saw pretty much a step function change that happened on an immediate basis. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Brian Ossenbeck : So Adam, I just wanted to ask a little bit more about how you view the truckload market here. I know in the past, you said you thought some other freight moved over. I think you mentioned it earlier. But how much of that went over I guess, with the disruption with Yellow, do you still think that can come back to LTL and tighten it up? So is that kind of above and beyond what you normally see from a cyclical perspective? And maybe on a related topic, are you seeing anything interesting in terms of April shipping weight per shipment? Is that sort of a leading indicator that you're watching to see for early signs of stabilization improvement? Kevin Freeman : Yes, this is Marty. I agree with Adam that some of this Yellow freight did move over to full truckload carriers in the form of stop-offs where they take 3 or 4 shipments along with a 75% load and charge a couple of hundred bucks to do stock offs. They don't really like to do that nor do their drivers like to do it, but I do believe this moved over there because of the slowness in the truckload market this year and last year.  And I also agree that this will move back to LTL carriers once the truckload market picks back up. So -- and I suspect that will happen at the same time the LTL market starts to flourish again. So that will come straight back to the LTL market. Brian Ossenbeck : Any thoughts on weight per shipment and how that's trending and how we should expect that throughout the rest of the year? Adam Satterfield : Yes. We hope to see it continue to increase. That's typically an indicator of an improving economy as well. Like I mentioned, an increase from February to March, it's increased a little bit from March thus far into April as well. So that's something that we're probably on the low end of the scale in terms of how that metric changes.  It got a little skewed, if you will, with post Yellow and some of the incremental freight that we saw there. But historically speaking, in a strong demand environment, we've been closer to 1,600 pounds as an overall average. We're still down around 1,515 pounds and so we definitely have got some room to grow there. And that, too, creates and that's part of the leverage that you get from an operating ratio standpoint is weight continues to increase, you're getting more revenue per shipment, and that will help overall offset and kind of close that gap that we've seen with cost per shipment over the past years. The call relatively speaking, is -- should be very similar, but you're just getting more weight and more revenue per load, if you will. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Thomas Wadewitz : I wanted to -- it seems to me like the -- I guess, the freight environment improvement is a key catalyst for what you're going to see on the tonnage side and give you a chance to benefit from the capacity and service you can offer. What have you seen in terms of industrial customers versus the kind of retail and consumer customers where there's any kind of difference in behavior or trend or optimism. And I guess related maybe more to the retail side. It's been surprising that container imports have been pretty strong for a number of months. And yet the domestic freight environment seems like it's still pretty soft. So I don't know if you have any thoughts on what might be going on there if there's some inventory. But I guess any color on differences in customer segments or maybe why the imports aren't translating to domestic activity so much. Adam Satterfield : Yes. Overall, the retail continued to reflect -- or the industrial rather reflect the weakness that we've seen in the industrial economy. And in the first quarter, we had 1% revenue growth, but it was actually a slight decrease when you look at just our industrial-related accounts group together. So a little bit better performance on the retail side to offset that in the first quarter.  But again, hopefully, that's something now that we've seen ISM trend back above 50%, it had been below 50% for 16 months. I mean just this long, incredibly slow environment that we've been slugging through. But generally speaking, that indicates that improvement in that industrial environment, if we can stay above 50%, it should be coming, and that could be sort of in that May time frame.  So it's something that we'll continue to watch. But the retail continues to perform. We've also seen an improvement in the business that's managed by third-party logistics companies. And that's kind of in the early stages as well, but seeing some improvement there. I think is a good sign. Oftentimes, the 3PLs that have the systems, they're able to identify some of those top-off shipments that Marty was referencing earlier by being able to look through their entire inventory of capacity versus shipments.  And so if we're starting to see some growth there again with those and maybe some of that type of truck versus LTL swing might start reversing course. But again, I think it's just a lot of things are kind of in the early stages that we got to keep watch on and I don't want to get overly caught up in and -- but keep our fingers on the pulse, if you will, and continue to watch the trends and see if it manifests into increased LTL demand overall for which I think that we will more than be able to win our share. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Scott Group : So Adam, I know we're at the hour, there have been a lot of questions on price already, but -- so some of this may be repetitive. But like obviously, this these LTL stocks are getting hit pretty hard today, but the April yield numbers, they are what they are. But I just want to make sure, are you -- it doesn't feel like it, but are you in any way communicating any kind of change in the underlying pricing environment here, the competitive dynamic? I know you don't share pricing renewals every quarter like some of the other LTLs but maybe this quarter could be helpful. Are they slowing? Is it -- what's changing in your mind? Adam Satterfield : Yes. And again, to repeat, nothing is changing with respect to the core contract increases that we're achieving and that we're targeting. We continue to target cost plus increases, and we're getting those. It's just a little bit different in the mix of freight that we're seeing. We've seen a little bit of a decrease in length of haul.  Some change in increase in weight per shipment, like I mentioned, all those factors kind of lead to a lower revenue per hundredweight. So just looking at things on a pure per hundredweight basis, it's gone from, just call it, 6.5% growth in the first quarter to 4.5% excluding fuel so far in April.  But we've said before, hundredweight can move around quickly, and that's why internally, we focus more on revenue per shipment than anything. That's what we pick up every day, our shipments, and that's what we've got to figure out what's the cost to pick up a shipment. What's the cost of line haul a shipment, cross-docket. Everything that we do is driven on a per shipment basis. And I mean I think we can get back to having a positive spread of revenue per shipment versus our cost per shipment performance. So that will continue to be the initiative. I don't see anything changing with respect to the pricing environment and nothing changing that we've seen as we've gone through renewals and bids and so forth with respect to the other carriers in the industry.  And obviously, we'll see with their reports when they come out. But we've not seen anything change in that regard. It's just some mix changes that are impacting our revenue per hundredweight metrics thus far into April. Scott Group : But just so I'm clear, I don't think you guys talked about revenue per shipment accelerating with this mix shift or maybe it is, I just didn't hear that. Adam Satterfield : No, but it's staying consistent with where we were. The rev per shipment performance in April thus far is pretty consistent with what we just had in the first quarter. We were up 3.8% revenue per shipment in the first quarter, excluding the fuel surcharge. Scott Group : Okay. And then just one more question. You talked about like just the power of leverage. Now if I take what you're saying about Q2, you're sort of saying mid-single-digit plus sort of top line growth and flattish OR, right? So historically, we get mid-single-digit top line, and we see real OR improvement. How come -- maybe it's just a timing issue, how come you're not suggesting we see that the power of that leverage right away in Q2? Adam Satterfield : Well, I think that's something that obviously depending on how much volume growth we actually see in the quarter or not sequentially. We've invested significantly in many factors that we detailed earlier that create short-term costs. So if we can see some further improvement and if weight and shipments really accelerate kind of from here forward, and obviously, there's a lot of leverage that would therefore come from that.  But that's something that if we're -- if we continue to grow revenue, it's kind of a 6% year-over-year rate like we saw in April, then we tried to give a factor of, okay, maybe we'll only see 150 basis points of sequential improvement, which would still be a year-over-year improvement where we were in the second quarter last year.  But I think it's just going to move on a sliding scale, if you will, based on how much revenue comes in. And typically, like I mentioned, the revenue growth is between 8.5% and 9% to 8.7% from the first quarter to the second quarter. And we're just not there yet. And hopefully, we see further sequential improvement in May and June. And obviously, we give those -- we'll give the update for May, with our mid-quarter update as we go along.  But the improvement that we see in the operating ratio is typically 350 to 400 basis points of improvement. A lot of that improvement comes by way of the direct costs. It's mainly the salaries, wages and benefits and are op supplies and expenses, and that's coming from the improvement in operating density and taking advantage of all that incremental freight that's moving through the system.  So if all those things do develop, then obviously, we can produce further improvement in those direct costs. And like I mentioned earlier, from a headcount standpoint, I feel good about where we are. So it's not like we've got to scale up even more in terms of our hiring practices. But we'll probably be working more hours and doing things like that with the existing workforce. So there's opportunity to scale there. But like any other period, it's just going to be top line dependent for how much growth do we see and how much of that incremental growth will be able to put to the bottom line. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Kauffman of Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Kauffman : And Jack, congratulations, really looking forward to working with you in this role. A lot's been asked, so I just want to take a step back. It's been a weird couple of years, right? We had COVID, big up, big down, inflation. We've had inventory destocking. We've had the Yellow closure. We've had a lot of growth in private fleets. All of this, I think, makes it difficult to predict what's going to happen with business. But eventually, we do anniversary all these impacts and things start to resemble what might be considered a more normal operating environment. When do you think we get back to that? And where is your vision most foggy relative to what it would be without these oddities that have occurred? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I don't have my Carnac the Magnificent happier handy to be able to predict on when things are going to change, but that's probably the most buzziest thing is when will the inflection point happen. We -- obviously, it's called a cycle for a reason, and we will get back into a robust demand environment at some point. And when we do, we will be able to take advantage of that. And we've built the company up. We've been growing our company for years and continue to believe that we've got a lot of growth opportunity as we look out into the future. So obviously, we put on a lot of growth. We're able to grow our revenues, $1 billion in each of 2021 and 2022 and then ran into the slowdown in the economy.  So we've been making our way through that very well, very proud of the operating ratio that we were able to produce last year in a challenging environment. And we're still in an environment that we're not out of the woods yet, if you will. We still had in the first quarter, a 3% reduction in tons per day and essentially had a flat operating ratio, but we're able to produce positive earnings per share as well.  So I feel good about the base level of operations where we are today and being able to build on what we've established. So there's a long runway for growth out there when it comes to a top line standpoint that we believe for our business. And we've got further room to improve our operating ratio as well. And so that will allow us to achieve our vision of achieving long-term profitable growth that drives an increase in shareholder value.  So all those same elements are in place. There may be some different logos that have been moving around on service centers and different customers, given all the disruption that's taken place over the last 6 to 9 months. But OD stands ready, and we'll continue to add value to our customer supply chains and we feel like we'll be able to drive significant growth in our business as we go forward. Jeffrey Kauffman : As funny as you were talking about the service centers, I was just thinking you can add all the service centers you want, but that doesn't make your service or your culture equivalent. Adam Satterfield : And that's a great observation. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Marty Freeman for any closing remarks. Kevin Freeman : Yes. I'd like to thank all of you today for your participation, and we really appreciate your questions. If you have anything further, please feel free to give us a call, and we'll be glad to answer it. And I hope you have a good rest of the week. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Marty Freeman, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer for opening remarks. Marty, please go ahead, sir. Marty Freeman : Good morning and welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me today on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion's second quarter results represent our third consecutive quarter with year-over-year growth in revenue and earnings per diluted share despite the ongoing sluggish in the domestic economy. These results were made possible by the hard work and dedication of the OD family of employees who continue to execute our long-term strategic plan during the second quarter. I'd like to congratulate our outstanding team for maintaining our commitment to providing superior customer service at a fair price as well as our disciplined approach to managing yield, our laser focus on operating efficiencies and controlling our discretionary spending. Delivering superior service at a fair price is the cornerstone of our business model and our unmatched value proposition has continued to differentiate old Dominion Freight Line from our competition. I'm pleased to report that during the second quarter we once again provided an on time service level of 99% and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1%. Mastio: Our strong track record of industry leading service also means our customers view us as a trusted partner, which supports our consistent cost based approach to pricing. Our long-term yield management strategy is designed to help offset our cost inflation while also supporting further investments in the capacity and technology that our customers expect. We have been one of the only LTL carriers to constantly and consistently invest in new capacity over the past 10 years, which has supported our ability to almost double our market share over the same period. We are committed to constantly investing ahead of our anticipated growth curve, which is another differentiating quality for old dominion and what has been and what we believe will continue to be a capacity constrained industry. Over the past 10 years, we have invested over $2 billion in our service center network and we plan to invest another $350 million on real estate this year. These investments have positioned us to grow with our customers over time through the ups and downs of the economic cycle, which hasn't been the case with most of our competitors. Maintaining excess capacity in our service center network, which is approximately 30% at the end of the second quarter, does create some short-term cost headwinds during periods with slower demand, but we are confident that the capacity will be critical to support our customers when the economic environment starts to improve and business levels reaccelerate. With all that said, our network investments are not being made simply to handle the overflow during stronger periods of economic activity. Instead, as we look into the future, we believe demand for service sensitive LTF capacity will continue to grow. We believe that the combination of our best-in-class service and disciplined investments in network capacity position us to capture even more of the growing market in the years ahead. Over the last decade, Old Dominion Freight Line has won more market share than any other LTL carrier by consistently executing our strategic plan and remaining focused on long-term opportunities instead of short-term challenges. While we continue to wait on a recovery in the domestic economy, we believe the investments in our network, our technology, and most importantly, our people will continue to drive value to our customers. As a result, we believe we are the best positioned carrier in our industry to win market share over the long-term, while further enhancing shareholder value. Thank you today for joining us this morning and now Adam will discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail. Now, Adam? Company: Our strong track record of industry leading service also means our customers view us as a trusted partner, which supports our consistent cost based approach to pricing. Our long-term yield management strategy is designed to help offset our cost inflation while also supporting further investments in the capacity and technology that our customers expect. We have been one of the only LTL carriers to constantly and consistently invest in new capacity over the past 10 years, which has supported our ability to almost double our market share over the same period. We are committed to constantly investing ahead of our anticipated growth curve, which is another differentiating quality for old dominion and what has been and what we believe will continue to be a capacity constrained industry. Over the past 10 years, we have invested over $2 billion in our service center network and we plan to invest another $350 million on real estate this year. These investments have positioned us to grow with our customers over time through the ups and downs of the economic cycle, which hasn't been the case with most of our competitors. Maintaining excess capacity in our service center network, which is approximately 30% at the end of the second quarter, does create some short-term cost headwinds during periods with slower demand, but we are confident that the capacity will be critical to support our customers when the economic environment starts to improve and business levels reaccelerate. With all that said, our network investments are not being made simply to handle the overflow during stronger periods of economic activity. Instead, as we look into the future, we believe demand for service sensitive LTF capacity will continue to grow. We believe that the combination of our best-in-class service and disciplined investments in network capacity position us to capture even more of the growing market in the years ahead. Over the last decade, Old Dominion Freight Line has won more market share than any other LTL carrier by consistently executing our strategic plan and remaining focused on long-term opportunities instead of short-term challenges. While we continue to wait on a recovery in the domestic economy, we believe the investments in our network, our technology, and most importantly, our people will continue to drive value to our customers. As a result, we believe we are the best positioned carrier in our industry to win market share over the long-term, while further enhancing shareholder value. Thank you today for joining us this morning and now Adam will discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail. Now, Adam? Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Marty and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the second quarter of 2024 of $1.5 billion was a 6.1% increase from the prior year. The increase in revenue was due to a 4.4% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight and a 1.9% increase in LTL tons per day. Our operating ratio improved to 71.9%, which contributed to the 11.3% increase in earnings per diluted share to $1.48 for the core. On a sequential basis, our revenue per day for the second quarter increased 2.6% when compared to the first quarter of 2024 with LTL tons per day increasing 3.3% and LTL shipments per day increasing 3.2%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes an increase of 8.7% in revenue per day, an increase of 5.8% in tons per day, and an increase of 6.5% in shipments per day. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the second quarter were as follows. April increased 0.4% as compared to March, May increased 0.1% as compared to April, and June increased 1.9% as compared to May. The 10-year average change for these respective months is a decrease of 0.4% in April, an increase of 2.7% in May and an increase of 2.3% in June. I would like to note, however, that in years when Good Friday occurs in March, as it did this year, the average sequential change in LTL tons per day from March to April is a 2.6% increase. For July, we expect our revenue per day will increase by approximately 4% to 4.5% when compared to July of 2023 assuming the remaining days of the month follow normal historical trends. The growth rate in our revenue per day through the first half of July was relatively consistent with the second quarter. The comparisons have now become a little more difficult, however; as the final week of July last year was when we began to see freight diversion from a large competitor that ultimately filed for bankruptcy. We will provide the actual revenue related details for July and our second quarter. Form 10-Q. Our operating ratio improved 40 basis points to 71.9% for the second quarter of 2024 due primarily to the quality of our revenue growth and continued focus on operating efficiencies. Our team continued to do a great job of managing our direct variable costs during the second quarter, which allowed us to improve these costs as a percent of revenue. Our overhead costs, however, continued to increase as a percent of revenue despite our best efforts to minimize discretionary spending. As we have often said before, the two main ingredients to long-term operating ratio improvement are the combination of density and yield, both of which generally require a favorable macroeconomic environment. While we continue to execute on our yield management initiatives, it will likely take an improvement in the domestic economy before we see sustained momentum in shipping demand that generally leads to incremental market share opportunities and operating density. We remain confident that once we have both of these elements working again in our favor, our team can produce further improvement in our operating ratio and make progress towards our goal of achieving a sub-70 annual OR. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $387.8 million and $811.7 million for the second quarter and first half of 2024, respectively, while capital expenditures were $238.1 million and $357.6 million for those same periods. We utilized $551.8 million and $637.1 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the second quarter and first half of 2024, respectively, while cash dividends totaled $56.0 million and $112.6 million for the same periods. This year-to-date total for share repurchases includes $40 million that is deferred until the final settlement occurs on our current accelerated share repurchase agreement, which would be no later than November of 2024. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2024 was 24.5%, which was lower than originally expected due to the benefit of certain discrete tax items. The effective tax rate for the second quarter 2023 was 25.4%. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25% for the third quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jordan Alliger : Yes hi, good morning. Thanks for the update. Hey, I wonder, as you often do, is it possible to get some sense for, given the context of revenue per day and what you're seeing in the economy, how things could look seasonally, 2Q to 3Q in terms of the operating ratio? Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Yes, sir. Unfortunately, we're still dealing with an economy that's not contributing too much to us right now with 55% to 60% of our revenue being industrial related. The ISM continues to be below 50, and I think that's 19 out of the past 20 months. So it's hard to say what will happen from a top line basis and as you know, the revenue will dictate a lot of the performance, at least when we go sequentially. But I feel like some things have -- there have been some bright spots to look at in terms of the trend that we saw through June and so far this month in July, from a revenue and a volume standpoint. So we'll see how that continues to play out as we progress through the quarter and as we always do we will give our mid quarter update with the august performance once that is finished. But based on kind of where we are today, normal seasonality is typically about a 50 basis point increase sequentially from the second to the third quarter, and I think that's achievable. It's certainly what the goal would be, and I think that regardless of which way the revenue goes, if we stay kind of flattish like we've seen from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint, typically the average sequential change in revenue is about a 3.5% increase from the second to the third quarter. So wherever we fall along that spectrum from a top line basis, I still think that something along the lines of that 50 basis point sequential increase plus or minus of course, we generally give ourselves kind of plus or minus 20 basis points. But I think that's something that's certainly very achievable for the third quarter. Jordan Alliger : And just as a quick follow up, if I could just on the demand, you mentioned the sub-50 ISM and new orders index as well. I mean, as you sort of look ahead and talk to customers, I mean do you feel that there could be finally some change in that as we move through the year or is it tough to tell still? Adam Satterfield : Well, I think it's still tough to tell. I mean, I feel like things are starting to thaw a little bit. Again, I felt like we had a good performance through June. We finally had some, some good sequential increase there from a volume standpoint. And so a little bit of acceleration and somewhat similar to what we had in the final month of the first quarter with March there, but a nice increase from the May to June period. So it's something that we'll continue to watch. We've got the third quarter here, and then we typically go through the seasonally slower fourth quarter and first quarter. But hopefully some things are building. I think when you look at some of the macroeconomic factors would suggest that maybe some of the things that the Fed would watch would indicate that we may be closer to the interest rate environment may be improving a little bit and seeing some cuts out there that would certainly help from a business standpoint. So it seems like we're coming close to the end of a long, slow cycle, and we'll just have to continue to watch and see what's presented to us. But it certainly feels like we're seeing a little bit more opportunity out there than what we have been seeing. Jordan Alliger : Thank you so much. Operator : The next question is from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Yes, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Maybe Adam I wanted to ask one on the pricing side. I think the mid quarter update suggested pricing was stable. June actually seemed to have improved a bit. I guess how has pricing continued into July? Are we seeing any changes? And stepping back just from an industry standpoint, demand remains tepid to your point, can the industry support further GRIs and other rate increases in the back half of this year as comparisons get more difficult? Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Yes, I think what we've seen is just a continuation of executing on our long-term yield management philosophy, and we continue to target increases that offset our cost inflation and support the continued investment in capacity and technologies that our customers expect from us. And our yield trend in June and what we're seeing thus far in July is pretty similar from a year-over-year standpoint. If you just sort of look at normal seasonality and revenue per hundredweight, at least excluding fuel, normal sequential would imply that for the full quarter it would be up 4% to 4.5%, that metric, and some of that will be some mix change that we'll go through more so in August and September. If you think last year, following the disruption to the industry, our weight for shipment decreased quite a bit as we moved through August and September last year. Overall for the third quarter of 2023, it was down about 30 pounds versus the second quarter of 2023. So had that reduction in weight for shipment, and I would like to see that at least our weight per shipment has been stable. If that continues to increase further and a reflection, if there is any improvement in the economy, then that just becomes more challenging from a mix standpoint. But so far, what we've seen in July is pretty consistent with where we were in the second quarter, in June in particular. So we'll continue to see how that plays out. Daniel Imbro : Thanks so much. Best of luck guys. Operator : The next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Chris Wetherbee : Yes. Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe, Adam, if you could talk a little bit about weight per shipment trends. It's pretty flattish the last couple of quarters and certainly sequentially from 1Q to 2Q, just kind of your general thoughts on how you see that playing out. Obviously that could be part of just a sluggish economy as we're moving forward here. But if we can get a sense of maybe what you're seeing in July if there's any change in that. Adam Satterfield : Yes, no real change in July, still kind of continuing to bounce around that 1500 pounds mark. And to me I think that's what we've seen. Obviously we saw the unique change that happened last year right at the end of July going into August. And that took our weight down quite a bit like I just mentioned. But it just feels like we've been bouncing along the bottom and I think that's an indicator really where the industrial economy has been as well. So I think that should be one of the first signs and early indicators. If we start seeing some incremental weight on each shipment that we're picking up, that orders might be picking up and that would obviously be good for a lot of measurements. If we can get more weight per shipment, generally that's going to lead to the improvement in operating efficiencies and generally that leads into improved volumes in general if the underlying economy truly is improving. So all things that we are very prepared for in terms of the capacity in our service center network, the capacity of our people and our fleet, we are primed and in position to respond whenever the market does. In fact inflect to the positive. Chris Wetherbee : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Adam, just a couple of follow-ups if I can. First, the 4% to 4.5% revenue, any sense of breaking that down between tonnage and then yield? And then I just want to make sure I'm understanding your commentary about the 50 basis points worse, which is normal. Are you saying even if we don't get the full typical 3.5% sequential revenue increase, we can still stay with the normal or degradation and it's not worse. Is that the message that you're giving? Adam Satterfield : Yes, I think to answer that question first, yes I think that we're going to go with the 50 basis points being the target. And again, keep in mind, just like we said last quarter, it's put a plus or minus around that. I am not being that specific, anything can happen. But I think that our team is continuing to do a great job with managing cost in this lower volume environment, and we will continue to do so as we progress through the third quarter. And so obviously it's a little bit easier if we've got some revenue contribution, we typically have an increase in certain cost elements as we progress through the quarter. We're continuing to execute on our CapEx plan. So we will have incremental depreciation dollars in the third quarter versus the second. We have a wage increase that will go out the 1st of September as well as it always does, so you get one month of that. And so we'll continue to monitor and measure operating efficiencies and we've been seeing some improvements there and have some other offsets as well. Continue to manage every discretionary dollar that's going out the door in managing to the business levels that we're seeing. So we'll continue to do all those things, but certainly hope that we'll see a little bit of incremental revenue improvement and that will make things easier, obviously, but we're going to continue to manage and have that hanging out there as our goal to achieve. Scott Group : And then any just quick thoughts, record buyback in the quarter, is this this a change in sort of capital returns? Is this a new sort of run rate to think about going forward? Adam Satterfield : No, it's no change. I think it's similar. It was a record level, as you say, but you go back a couple of years ago and when our stock performed similar to the big drop that we saw during the second quarter, if you go back to 2022, we spent $1.3 billion in total that year, so had some pretty hefty quarters that was just spread more through the year. But our stock was off 20% to 25% from 52-week highs going back to the last quarter's phone call and earnings call and so as we've done in the past, we stepped in and were more aggressive with our repurchases. Now the stock price has recovered a bit and so be going back more so to kind of our normalized grid based approach to repurchasing shares. But we just stepped in a little bit more aggressively with the cash that we had on the balance sheet and purchased more during that second quarter, including an accelerated share repurchase agreement as well, and which we still got a little bit of about $40 million that was deferred on that agreement, that should settle sometime late third quarter or early in the fourth quarter. Scott Group : Thank you, guys. I appreciate the time. Operator : The next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. This is probably the first up cycle in a while, maybe ever, where it's not just you who has the excess capacity, but a lot of your peers do as well. I think you kind of alluded to that in your prepared remarks as well. Do you get a sense that their approach to having this excess capacity and dealing with the drag on incremental margins is similar to your own or do you feel that they may be going to looking to deploy that capacity a little bit earlier than you guys? Adam Satterfield : Yes, I can't answer for what they're going to do with any measure of any excess capacity any individual carrier has, but with respect to just looking at the industry broadly, I feel like that we're going to be a more capacity constrained industry than we were previously. If you go back, we estimate that shipping volumes are down about 15% from the peak back in 2021. And when you look at the number of service centers that have settled from that bankruptcy proceeding, not all are in operation yet, but probably at least 10% and maybe more capacity will be coming out of the market. So, all those shipments that were being picked up and delivered by that carrier they are LTL shipments. They will come back to the market and our market will recover to the levels where it was previously and I believe will continue to increase further. So that's why we continue to believe and continue to invest ahead of our anticipated growth curve. We don't see anything that has changed with the opportunities that we have for long-term market share opportunities other than perhaps maybe they've gotten stronger. As more shippers look for high quality service carriers, inventory management continues to be an operating focus, especially in a higher interest rate environment, I think it puts the burden on shippers to select high quality carriers and there's none better than old Dominion. So we look at the market generally and believe we've got as strong an opportunity that we've ever had and we think we're better positioned than any other carrier to capitalize on and improve in the industry. Ravi Shanker : Understood, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Thomas Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead. Thomas Wadewitz : Yes, good morning. So, Adam, I wanted to see if you could give us, I apologize if I missed this, but I think just like the July tonnage and shipments, I think you talked about revenue terms but not the tonnage and shipments. I don't know if you want to give us like normal seasonality, July versus June or year-over-year, but some kind of framework for thinking about shipments and tonnage in July. Adam Satterfield : Yes. The breakdown, if you will, of the revenue, it's definitely in flux. I mean, like I mentioned, we were in the first part of this month, we were growing at a similar rate from a revenue per day standpoint is where we were for the second quarter and kind of that 6% range. And obviously the comps have changed pretty considerably, mainly starting this week in particular. And so it's going to cause a little disruption to what the tonnage numbers look, what we're seeing today, we can extrapolate out and we do where we think we'll finish. But I think there's going to be a little flux with respect to what those final volume numbers and yield numbers might look like given the drastic change in business levels and mix that we saw in that last part of the month of July. But at this point, I would say that that in that 4% to 4.5%, I would say that the volumes are probably about flattish and that could be plus or minus, one way around that and that flatness. And then from a yield standpoint, again pretty consistent with what we just saw in the second quarter. And right now it's looking a little bit stronger, but we'll see where those final numbers land and of course we'll put the final details out there. But just from a pure revenue standpoint, though, and just looking at revenue per day, July and October are the months that we see decreases in as we go month-to-month and progress through the year. And what we're seeing from a pure revenue per day standpoint is it's pretty consistent with what normal seasonality would otherwise be, which is a drop off somewhere in kind of the 2.5% type of range and that's pretty consistent with what our five year average has been there. So we'll look to see that we get some recovery back in August, which is normal and then September, as you know, is pretty much our strongest month of the year. So can we see stronger acceleration going into the end of the quarter? I would hope so. We saw strong performance in March, strong performance in June, and if that can repeat, we'll see where we land. But that's kind of the lay of the land and what things are looking like at the moment. And of course, we'll update, as I mentioned earlier, with the final July and then the mid quarter update with our August trends. Thomas Wadewitz : Okay, yes thank you for that. Just one other quick one on headcount, how are you thinking about headcount sequentially? Are you in kind of a flattish volume environment? Are we modeling headcount down a little bit sequentially or are you kind of keeping it flat and keeping some capacity for when the volume improves? Adam Satterfield : Well, I think we're in a good spot from an overall headcount standpoint. At the end of June, we're 150 to 200 people ahead of where we were in September of last year when we were handling 51,000 shipments per day, so we're in a good spot there. It drifted down just normal attrition kind of taking place through the second quarter. And if that continues to occur as we go through the second half of the year, we're always balancing the changes and so forth, generally in alignment with what our shipment counts are and how they're changing. So it'd be something that we continue to watch and deal with. But at this point we're getting closer to where you generally have the seasonally slower parts of the year once we get into 4Q and 1Q, but we're keeping our eye out for what 2025 might look like and you don't wait until it's coming at you. You've got to get ahead of the curve, if you will and that's why this year we invested so much, and we always are investing in our people and restarted our truck driving schools and so forth and it continued to increase the number of employees with their CDLs to be ready for when our customers call on us and they need capacity, we want to be in a position to be able to respond with a yes, we can help you versus trying to play catch-up and be reactive. Thomas Wadewitz : Great. Thank you for the time. Operator : Jon Chappell : Jonathan Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Adam, you know as well as anybody the bear thesis about capacity coming online, whether it's the terminals that were auctioned or the organic growth by some of your peers and what that may be the pricing, sounds like early stages of 3Q pricing has been relatively consistent, but as we think about the anniversarying, the Yellow bankruptcy starting in 4Q most especially from a yield perspective, is there any reason why you wouldn't see typical seasonal trends in yield beyond this summer, whether that relates to capacity or any other factors in the market? Adam Satterfield : Like I said earlier, maybe to just elaborate on that, but we're continuing to see good yield performance and that's what we expect. I mean this is something that we work on day by day. Our sales team and our pricing and costing teams are all working together and working with our customers to ultimately provide value to their supply chains. But our yield management philosophy is to attain increases that not necessarily are market driven in a sense of the markets in our favor or not. It's what's our cost inflation looking like? And then what are the continuing needs of our business. And that's been a long-term philosophy that is consistent and has worked for us and so that's what we would continue to expect as we move forward as well. We're negotiating and working every day and would expect that as any contracts are coming due, that we will work through and need to obtain increases on those, so regardless of what other carriers and specific issues or areas or whatnot may be going on, we expect that we'll continue to see a disciplined environment in the industry and that's what we've seen thus far. So we'll just continue to manage through that and keep sort of focusing on what we do and what we can deliver and continue to add value to our customer supply chains. Jonathan Chappell : Okay. Thank you, Adam. Operator : The next question is from Eric Morgan with Barclays. Please go ahead. Eric Morgan : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask one on cost inflation. Your comp per employee has been up maybe mid-single digits or so for about a year now. Just wondering, as you think about another wage increase later this quarter and as broader inflation measures are trending down a little bit, should we start to see that moderate and maybe how does that factor into the sequential OR outlook for 3Q? Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Well, generally speaking, when you look over the longer term, when you look at our cost per shipment, if you will, wage cost per shipment, it's generally going up about 3% to 3.5% and more in line with what the wage increase that we give every year has been. There's been inflation that we've seen in our benefit cost, and we experienced some of that as well in the second quarter. And those fringe benefit costs include multiple factors, some of which are improvements to the overall comp program that we offer to employees and things like paid time off benefits that we've improved over the years and the quality of our group health and dental programs as well. So, I mean, those are incremental changes that we're always having to manage. And maybe there's a little bit more variability in terms of when you're self-insured on the health program, you can have changes in one quarter versus the next that aren\u2019t necessarily going in alignment with what shipment volumes may be changing. But looking over time, that's just something that we would expect will continue to change and reflect the improvements. In terms of the benefit program and comp program that we offer employees. But 65% of our costs are salaries, wages and benefits, so that's generally been the biggest driver of our total cost for shipment inflation. That's averaged 3.5% to 4% over the long-term as well, so that all goes into it. We've had a lot of other incremental inflationary items, things like the cost of our equipment, maintenance costs that have been up double digits on a per mile basis the last few years, insurance costs that is a problem for the industry, that have been up double digits for multiple years in a row. All of those things we contend with and that's why there's got to be an ongoing focus on operating efficiency and discretionary spending, and we're managing our costs day by day in good times and bad. If you wait until it's too late, if you wait until they're bad times, you got to have that focus going every day or you may not even know where to start. So that's something that we're always looking at. How can we offset all those other costs to basically keep our cost inflation in check and then, as you know, the yield management philosophy is we try to achieve 100 to 150 basis points of positive spread over top of that cost inflation metric. So that keeps our pricing levels in check with the rest of the industry as well. So it all kind of goes into it, but it's a day by day fight to try to keep our cost inflation minimized as best as we can. Eric Morgan : I appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Bascome Majors : Adam, it's encouraging to hear that some signs of seasonality have stuck with you through July so far and I appreciate the framing of typical 3Q seasonality on both the top line and the margin side. Can we look ahead to 4Q without necessarily blessing whether the market suggests we'll be above or below, but how do you frame seasonality for your business into 4Q both on top line and a margin basis, looking back historically as we try to level set our views? Thank you. Adam Satterfield : Yes, so as I've said a couple of times, the fourth quarter and the first quarter are seasonally slower periods, if you will. The fourth quarter, from just a pure revenue per day standpoint, it's just a slight drop off. And then you go into the first quarter and revenue is down, maybe down in the fourth quarter 0.5% sequentially versus the third quarter, and then you drop on average about 1.5% going into the first quarter. From an operating ratio standpoint, the fourth quarter is typically about 200 to 250 basis points higher than the third. And a lot of that is the revenue level softening a little bit. We've got three months of that wage increase. And that normal change, if you remember from last year, we always have actuarial assessment of our insurance reserves in the fourth quarter and those adjustments can go one way or the other and I generally view those as a reconciling item to whatever that normal change is. And last year was an unfavorable adjustment to that insurance and claims line. A few years prior they had been favorable adjustments. So kind of throw that out of the window when just looking at what is that normal cost progression change. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ken Hoexter : Great, thanks and good morning. I guess maybe I need to check numbers a little bit. I think we've got a 10-year average in second quarter or to third quarter of a 10 basis point improvement, not a 50 basis point decrease, so I just wanted to double check that. And then as you start to lap the Yellow freight data, last year you went from down upper teens on revenue per day and mid-teens tons per day to kind of much smaller losses. I guess given that backdrop, how should we think about the market kind of tonnage per day growth? I know you've talked a lot about revenue per day, but how do we think about the tons per day shift as we move into the third or into the back half of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter? Adam Satterfield : Yes, and I'll come back to that. Let me just address the second quarter to third quarter change. You're right, the pure math is more about a 10 basis point change, but there are a couple of years in there that skew that. In 2023 last year obviously we had a major acceleration in revenue that allowed us to improve the operating ratio 170 basis points from 2Q to 3Q and then 2020 was similar where you had the COVID cliff that happened and then the reacceleration of business levels. So when I just look at more of a normalized kind of progression, that's typically what we'd expect, unless you've got something unusual going on that would drive some change there. With respect to the tonnage question and shipments, obviously as you said, we had the acceleration that was meaningfully happening last year. If you recall, we were at 47,000 shipments per day, really from December of 2022 through July of 2023, and immediately stepped up to about 50,000 in August and then accelerated further to 51,000 in September. So, step function change that would be well above anything that was really happening with the underlying economy, if you will. So, if we can see some type of normal acceleration, if you will, just like from a tonnage standpoint, our 10-year average from July to August is six tenths of a percent increase there and then about a 3.5% increase in September. So we'll see how that goes. But right now, even if we hit those, it would look like you would have a negative change in those volumes. But overall, I think it's just as we look at things sequentially, maybe more so than just a year-over-year, given that challenge is what can we achieve relative to what normal seasonality would be and what we've seen at least so far through July. From a tons per day standpoint, just from a pure quarter, we're typically up about 1% when we gave the numbers earlier, but in the second quarter, that average is just call it 6% and we were up 3% just sort of rounding numbers. So we were up kind of half of what normal seasonality would suggest. So we've got to make up some ground. Like I said earlier, we always lose a little bit of business in July, and that's normal. And so if we can have kind of a little bit of acceleration through August and then see some acceleration into September, we were almost at normal seasonality in the June period. And the same thing with March, you've got to adjust for the Good Friday, but we're about at seasonality in those stronger growth months of the quarter. So if we can make some progress in August and then see some sense of that strong acceleration through the month of September, I think we'll be okay. And we've position ourselves well, whenever we come out of this true economic downturn, where we're operating at a 72, essentially, and 71.9 [ph] I guess I should take credit for every basis point we have in terms of where we've operated. And when I look at the breakdown of our operating ratio in the quarter and where we are from an overhead standpoint relative to our direct variable costs, I'm really pleased with the improvement that we've made with our direct cost performance. And that just gets into the day-to-day management within our operations in the field, primarily. But everyone is contributing to that overall operating ratio. But our overhead costs have increased. They were 20% to 21% of revenue in the most recent quarter. Those costs have been down to around 17% in the past. So once we get some true density coming back into the network, we've built our network and our system to accommodate more than 50,000 shipments a day. So once we get back into 50,000, 55,000, 60,000, whatever that number is, that's where you'll really see the power of operating density in the model. And you move that scale from 20% to 21% back towards 17% that puts us back in with an overall with the 6 handle on it, back where we were in 2022. So I think we're in a great spot and have managed through this downturn very well and has certainly put ourselves in a great position to capitalize on the market when we actually start seeing some economic wins at our back. Ken Hoexter : Thanks for the time, Adam. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, Adam, maybe you can elaborate a little bit more on what end markets or maybe customers are seeing some of that strength at the end of the last two quarters in March and June. Is there anything to read into that? Does it give you any sort of forward looking to the back half of the year or next year? And then just kind of another follow up on competition and extra capacity coming online are you seeing anything as these new facilities come back online, anything that you would call out from either service being disrupted by some of your competitors or are they being a little bit more aggressive to maybe fill some of those doors and pricing more to capacity and not necessarily cost? Marty Freeman : Good morning, this is Marty. I'm going to answer your customer question. I'm still heavily involved with a lot of our top customers and the feeling out there is not all doom and gloom. In fact, our top 50 customers are up mid-single digits year-to-date. So we're getting a lot of positive remarks, especially from our larger customers and they as well see some positive things for the rest of the year. So we're very positive of and that those things will continue. And as Adam said earlier, they feel, and I feel if we can see some interest rate drops toward the end of the year, I think we'll really accelerate. So we're looking forward to that and prepared to handle it. So it's not all doom and gloom out there, trust me. Adam Satterfield : Yes. And on the competitive side, we've not seen, I don't think, any material change in the sense of, if someone has opened one service center in whatever market, any type of real impact. And as you can see in our yield trends, things continue to be consistent with our performance. That's just something we'll continue to manage through and monitor. But given the cost that went into purchasing many of these facilities, we'd be a little surprised to see someone going out and having to be aggressive to try to fill it up. And at the end of the day, those service centers served the market for a reason. They were in existence. And those particular markets had a customer base that their sales rep called on and there are LTL shipments that are out there. And as I referenced earlier, I mean, the market is down overall and we estimate that it's down about 15% from back from in 2021, but that's something that will recover. Those LTL shipments, those customers will continue to have freight that needs to be moved through an LTL network. And I think that will end up creating opportunity for us, for the industry in general, to refill those facilities, if you will, once they come online. But to me, it creates maybe even more of an opportunity for Old Dominion specifically. Marty Freeman : I agree with that. There are still over 130 facilities that haven't been sold. So that's actually less capacity when things pick up than we had when YRC was still in business. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, thanks very much, guys. Operator : The next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Stephanie Moore : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to touch a bit on some of your network investments and maybe some of the terminals that have been opened so far this year. So may be if you could give us an update on the new terminal openings or door additions year-to-date thus far? And then an update in terms of your plans for maybe the back half of this year, if there's been any kind of maybe postponement or pause, just given the state of the underlying macro, any color there would be helpful? Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Yes, we've opened three service centers this year and we're continuing to execute on our CapEx plan. The current estimate is to spend about $350 million this year, at least on the real estate component of that program. So our plan is we look at the network. We look at the service centers that we feel like need some measure of capacity. And when we look kind of over the next five years, and what the anticipated growth curve may be and the efficiency of the network comes into play as well, the location of where these facilities are and so that kind of goes into the overall plan. And we're a little bit heavy right now, frankly. It's not unusual when we go through a slower economic environment to get a little ahead of the curve. Our long-term strategy is we like having 20% to 25% excess capacity in the system. We're at about 30% today and that's okay. We're comfortable with that. Now, what that may mean is exactly what you said. There may be facilities that are in process today. We will finish those facilities, and if the demand environment doesn't dictate that we go ahead and open them immediately, we'll finish the construction, we'll start the depreciation and so forth of those facilities. But we'll wait until there's stronger demand to really justify the opening and all the incremental overhead cost that goes along with those facilities once they're operational. Not just the overhead, but there's configurations to the line haul network that has to happen, and generally that negatively impacts load factors. So that's something that these other carriers that are opening multiple facilities will be facing the incremental cost there, which is another reason why we don't anticipate seeing reductions in pricing or any pressures there. But so that's something that just goes into it and we'll continue to look and evaluate, but overall continuing to plan and we'll continue to -- the investments that we make are really just based on what we think the market share opportunities are in each of the respective areas. And so we feel like we've got tremendous opportunity ahead and thus we intend to continue to spend 10% to 15% of our revenue revenues every year on total capital expenditures, the real estate, and then obviously on the fleet and the technology side as well to keep pace with our anticipated growth. Stephanie Moore : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question is from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Bruce Chan : Hey, good morning everyone. Adam I wanted to followup on the seasonality and the macro comments or certainly Marty, given your discussion with customers. But obviously there's a lot of moving parts this year with the geopolitical situation and with the election. There has been some talk on the 3PL side about volume pull forward. So maybe just wondering if you've gotten any indication from customers to that effect or if you think the demand and seasonality conversations seem to be pretty clear right now. Thank you. Marty Freeman : Yes. As I said before, about a third of our business is 3PL related and those are basically the top customers that I was referring to. And most of those that come in here are giving us new opportunities to go in with them and handle their business and for the most part, they're super positive. We have a set of 3PLs in here this morning that I've already talked to, and they're super positive and they've got growth opportunities. So, I'm positive as well that we'll see some positive results from these customers and hopefully next year in the geopolitical environment, if we see some change there, I think it will be even more positive. Adam? Adam Satterfield : No, I don't really have anything to add. I think that obviously, anytime there's an election year that creates uncertainty and usually puts pressure on the overall shipping environment, and we've seen that this year on top of a slower industrial economy in general. So, I think that's something that will just be one more measure of uncertainty that will soon be put to bed, whatever direction it goes. But I think just broadly speaking, if we start having clarity on some of the macro factors that are impacting business owners and the decisions that they make about expanding their businesses and so forth, and we can make changes from an interest rate environment that helps and helps people and the consumer. We're still a consumer driven economy and so that's so that's something that if we can keep a healthy consumer out there, they're buying things, that creates inventory that's got to be replenished. That's the customer call that comes into OD for a shipment to be picked up, so that will be the opportunity created. So it's something that we'll continue to measure and monitor and so forth. But as Marty mentioned, we're seeing improved performance with our 3PL customers right now. We had a little bit stronger retail related performance in the second quarter. Industrial was okay, but kind of reflects the industrial environment, like the ISM metrics that we talked about earlier. So, but all of that, it's called a cycle for a reason. And it's easy to get called up when you're in the down part of the cycle. We've managed through that. We've been in the down part of the cycle for a lot longer than I had originally anticipated, but it will turn back to the positive at some point and we're in a great position to capitalize when it does. Bruce Chan : Yes, thanks for that. Operator : The next question is from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Hey, Marty, hey Adam. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I just wanted to follow up, Marty, to some of your comments. You mentioned that you've been talking to a lot of your big customers and it's not all doom and gloom. I was wondering sort of what areas those customers just spread across the board is this more consumer versus industrial? And the other one would be, we've heard a lot about some business being pulled forward from peak season into the 2Q and I guess the startup 3Q here. I'm wondering if you guys have seen any impacts from that and how should we look at that going forward? Marty Freeman : Well, it's all over the board from a product or commodity standpoint. As you see on the news daily, your hospitality and your travel markets are the ones that's really up over the industrial sector. But the commodities and opportunities that we have from these 3PLs and other customers, it's just all over the board. Inventories are all over the board. You hear from some that say, we still have a little inventory from last year and others say our inventory is getting low. So we're going to start ordering product, whether that be domestically or overseas. It's just all over the board. But like I said earlier, I'm still, I'm very positive that things have basically bottomed out and I'm looking forward to better times. Jason Seidl : Okay. In terms of the pull forward, have you seen any impact? Adam Satterfield : We've not really heard any material discussion of any pull forward or whatnot at this point or at least I've not heard anyone, anyone from our sales team or any customer that we've had here in the office that's really spoken to that. Marty Freeman : Yes, me either. Jason Seidl : Okay, perfect. Gentlemen, I appreciate the time as always. Adam Satterfield : Thanks, Jason. Operator : And the final question today is from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much and thanks for squeezing me in at last here. Marty, bigger picture thought question, and I'm just curious, your view. If I look at the ATA/LTL tonnage index, it's down about 8%. And a year ago, before Yellow, the volumes of the publicly traded LTL carriers were tracking more closely to that. Since Yellow happened, the publicly traded group is showing kind of flat to up 2% tonnage, but the ATA tonnage index is still showing down about 8%. Is there something going on? Why would it diverge so much? And is there something going on maybe where the smaller LTL carriers might be struggling a little bit more than you and some of your larger peers? Can you help me kind of bridge this gap? Marty Freeman : Well, I think probably what you saw when YRC went out of business is that, customers were struggling to find ways to move that freight. And some of it went, and not a large portion of it, but some of it went to your smaller freight forwarders, airfreight forwarders, smaller logistic companies and I think that's where some of that has gone. And those guys basically don't have any assets, so they're handling it at a lower rate. And I think some of that business moved to full truckload carriers as the economy started to slow. And as I've said before, when your economy starts to pick back up your -- the LTL industry will benefit from that, even from the full truckload industry because we saw some of that freight move to those full truckload carriers as it relates to stop offs. And once those full truckload carriers begin to get busier and their capacity gets tighter, that freight will move back toward the LTL industry. So I think that type, the business moved a little bit everywhere based on price and so that's how I see it. That's the only way I can explain it. Jeff Kauffman : So the bigger point I'm going for here is, as you mentioned earlier, you got the PMI down in negative territory. Right now, industrial production is kind of flattish. You're 50%, 60% industrial. When we look at your tonnage growth of 2% and you're nothing chasing any Yellow business, the industry is probably a lot weaker in aggregate than what the five or six publicly traded truckload companies are reporting, that that 2% tonnage growth actually is stronger than the industry appears to be if we look at it through a broader lens, and not just the lens of the publicly traded guys. Adam Satterfield : Yes, like you said, I mean, it's hard to know as we don't have access to all the private carriers, if you will. But we think some of that business may have gone there. But I think everyone's just been facing the challenge of the slower economy and so that business, it's hard to trace through. When Yellow did 50,000 shipments per day and you just look at, I did the comparison of looking at second quarter 2023 numbers and most recently compared them to the first quarter of 2024 for at least the publicly traded carriers, which are 65% to 70% of the industry's revenue. But trying to trace through and figure out where all those shipments went and how they're being handled and in what mode are they being handled by is a tough task. But the thing that we take away and what I mentioned earlier is if economically it made sense for those shippers to move their freight within the LTL environment, sharing the cost, leveraging an LTL carriers network, sharing the cost on smaller shipment sizes with other shippers within the environment, all the benefits of moving freight by LTL that exist, which creates, we think, long term opportunity for our industry. Those shipments are going to return and they will be there and available again and so that's why we continue to believe that our industry will be increasing. We'll get back to the levels where we were in 2021 and I believe we'll grow further beyond there and we're in an environment that I think we'll end up with, who knows what the final capacity number will be. But at this point it looks like total industry capacity could be down 10% or maybe even more from where we were at that 2021 period. So you've got more volumes and less capacity overall that exist. And there may still be a little bit of shuffling around with those shipments and ultimately finding a home. Once the market tightens up and everyone gets really busy again, I think that's when you'll see who's really got the best long-term strategy. Who has got the best service, the best value, network capacity, people capacity, equipment capacity. I think when you look at all those factors and who delivers the best value I think the answer is clearly Old Dominion. And so that's why we're excited about what our long-term opportunities are and I think that we will continue to win market share and ultimately create incremental shareholder value. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you for your insight. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Marty Freeman for any closing remarks. Marty Freeman : Thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further and I hope you have a good day and a good rest of your summer. Thanks.

At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty Freeman, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. Marty, please go ahead, sir. Kevin Freeman : Good morning and welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. I am joining the call today from a separate location, therefore, please bear with us when we are taking questions if there are any connectivity issues. Old Dominion's financial results in the third quarter reflect continued softness in the domestic economy. Our revenue and earnings per diluted share both declined on a year-over-year basis during the quarter, although our market share and volume trends remained relatively consistent with the first half of the year. While the operating environment continued to be challenging. Our team did a good job of managing our variable cost and we also continue to control our discretionary spending. The deleveraging effect from the decrease in revenue, however, caused many of our cost categories to increase as a percent of revenue. This was the primary driver for the increase in our operating ratio to a 72.7 in the third quarter. We have been pleased with the consistency in our market share this year, which is consistent with our historical experience doing slower parts of the economic cycle. We continue to have strong customer retention trends and we are also winning new business. Our customers simply have had fewer shipments that they contender to us and our average weight per shipment has also remained at historical lows. The stability of our market share continues to be supported by the quality of our service and overall value that we offer to our customers. These are a few of the foundational elements of our long-term strategic plan. The OD family of employees continued to execute on these core principles during the third quarter as our own time service was 99% and our cargo claims ratio was a 0.1%. While we are incredibly proud of these service statistics, we would also like to remind you that superior service means much more than simply picking up and delivering our customers freight on time and claims free. There are plenty of other attributes that shippers consider when selecting a carrier, such as carriers' trustworthiness, ease of doing business, and the quality and responsiveness of customer service representatives. In fact, Mastio & Company measured 28 different service and value related attributes as part of its recent annual survey of shipper and logistic professionals. Mastio published the results of his 2024 study last week and we were honored to be named the number one national LTL provider for the 15 consecutive year. OD finished number one in 23 of the 28 evaluated categories measured by Mastio and maintained a sizable lead against our competition when it comes to the overall quality of service. I would like to congratulate the entire OD family of employees on this remarkable achievement and I would also like to thank this outstanding team for their commitment to our company and our customers. We continue to believe that consistency and quality of our service over the long-term has differentiated Old Dominion in the marketplace and driven our long-term profitable growth. While becoming the best carrier in the business was hard. Remaining the best carrier for 15 straight years is an incredible accomplishment and that is hard to put in perspective. Every member of the OD team has played a part in our success and I can assure you that each of us is incredibly motivated to keep delivering our promises to provide our customers with the highest standard of service. By continuing to provide best in class service to our customers day-after-day and year-after-year, we are also able to maintain our long-term and disciplined approach to pricing. We continue to focus on consistently improving our yields to sufficiently offset our cost inflation and support additional investments in capacity and technology. These ongoing investments have created incremental value for our customers in many ways, which has further enhanced our industry leading value proposition. Our customers have recognized our value proposition over time, which has allowed us to be able to earn more and more of their business. As a result, we have won more market share over the past 10 years than any carrier in our industry. While the economic environment has remained sluggish for much longer than we ever anticipated, we believe we are better positioned than ever to respond to the eventual inflection in demand that will occur as the economy improves. We have the capacity, the fleet and most importantly, the committed team of people to take advantage of an improving economic environment. Our unique company culture and each employee's commitment to excellence gives me tremendous confidence that we can also be the biggest market share winner over the next 10 years. This confidence is bolstered by the results of the most recent Mastio study as well as the ongoing conversations we have with our customers. By staying focused on long-term opportunities for additional profitable growth, we remain confident in our ability to create additional value for our shareholders. Thank you for joining us on the call this morning and now Adam will discuss our third quarter in greater detail. Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Marty and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue totaled $1.47 billion for the third quarter 2024, which was a 3.0% decrease from the prior year. We had one extra workday in the third quarter of this year, so the decrease on a per day basis was 4.5%. These revenue results reflect the 4.8% decrease in LTL tons per day that was partially offset by the 1.5% increase in LTL revenue per hundred way. On a sequential basis, our revenue per day for the third quarter decreased 1.9% when compared to the second quarter of 2024. With LTL tons per day decreasing 3.2% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 1.0%. For comparison, the 10 year average sequential change for these metrics includes an increase of 3.6% in revenue per day, an increase of 0.9% in LTL tons per day, and an increase of 2.3% in LTL shipments per day. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the third quarter were as follows. July decreased 4.4% as compared to June, August decreased 0.8% as compared to July and September increased 1.7% as compared to August. The 10 year average change for these respective months is a decrease of 2.9% in July, an increase of 0.6% in August, and an increase of 3.5% in September. For October, we expect our revenue per day will decrease by approximately 11.2% to 11.8% when compared to October 2023, with a decrease of approximately 9.2% to 9.8% in our LTL tons per day. As usual, we will provide the actual revenue related details for October in our third quarter Form 10-Q. Our operating ratio increased 210 basis points to 72.7% for the third quarter of 2024. As Marty mentioned, the decrease in our revenue had a deleveraging effect on many of our operating expenses during the quarter. This contributed to the 110 basis point increase in our overhead cost as a percent of revenue. In addition, and for the first time this year, our direct operating cost also increased as a percent of revenue when compared to the same quarter of the prior year. The increase in our direct operating cost as a percent of revenue was primarily due to an increase in cost associated with our group health and dental plans. As a result, our employee benefit cost increased to 38.6% of salaries and wages during the third quarter of 2024 from 37.3% in the same period of the prior year. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $446.5 million for the third quarter and $1.3 billion for the first nine months of 2024, respectively, while capital expenditures were $242.8 million and $600.4 million for the same periods. We utilized $187.7 million and $824.8 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, while our cash dividends totaled $55.6 million and $168.2 million for the same periods. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter, 2024 was 23.4% as compared to 24.08% in the third quarter of 2023. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be 24.5% for the fourth quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator will be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Eric Morgan of Barclays. Please go ahead. Eric Morgan : Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. I guess I just wanted to start on the near-term. sounds like October tonnage decline is getting a little bit worse relative to September. Is that being driven by, shipment weights coming lower? Kind of has been the trend here recently. And then, how are you thinking about operating ratio into year-end here? That'd be helpful, thank you. Adam Satterfield : Yeah. From a volume standpoint, the year-over-year our tonnage is in October. Take the midpoint of that range that we gave would be down about nine and a half percent. And obviously we've got many days left to finish out this month and so we'll see how the rest of the month finish is why we gave a little bit more of a range than we normally do. But if you take the midpoint of that in October, that's got our sequential change down. Just call it about 3.5%. The 10-year average sequential is a decrease of 3.1% and that's October versus September. So, it's actually encouraging to see what our volume trends so far this month have been. This is the first time that we've been, I would say relatively close to what our normal sequential changes have been in the first month of the quarter. So, we feel pretty good about how volumes are trending and continued strength in our yield performance that we've seen as well. So, we'll continue to watch that. But the year-over-year I think is just skewed a bit by, if you recall last year, we had a competitor that had a cybersecurity issue and we had some temporary freight coming into the system, if you will. So, we picked up some incremental freight there that was a bit unusual and caused outperformance from a seasonality standpoint that obviously is not there right now. But feeling good thus far about the October trend. Eric Morgan : Thanks. And just the operating ratio side of that, if you wouldn't mind. Appreciate it. Adam Satterfield : Yeah, I was going to try to leave that maybe for someone else. Those are two big questions packed into one. So just try to keep questions to one. But just to go ahead and address that because we know it's going to be a question anyways. The normal 3Q to 4Q regression is about a 200 to 250 basis point deterioration, and that's excluding any insurance adjustments. We do an actuarial assessment in the fourth quarter every year. Sometimes those are good guys. Sometimes like last year, I think we had about a 70 basis point headwind when it came to the actuarial adjustment. It was an unfavorable adjustment last year. So, I think when thinking about this fourth quarter, conservatively, I think we probably ought to slide that scale up about 100 basis points. And the reason for that would just be the continued risk from a revenue standpoint and the impact that would have on overhead expenses. We just saw that headwind play out in the third quarter kind of going back to the guidance that we gave at the end of the second quarter call, going into 2Q. Revenue came in softer and as a result our overhead expenses were about 40 basis points higher than kind of what we had anticipated at the end of the second quarter call. And then I think we also have a continued risk with respect to our fringe benefit costs. Those were higher than what the trend has been this year and higher than what they had been for the same period last year in the third quarter. And so, I think there's a continued risk those may stay a little bit higher in the fourth quarter. But both of those things are something that could trend better. I think if we have like I mentioned earlier, the October trend is starting out pretty good from a volume standpoint. So, if we can get our revenues back closer to seasonality, if you will, and obviously we'll give our mid quarter updates, then there can be some favorability there, but just some pluses and minuses. And I think from a conservative standpoint, probably better to just slide that scale up in terms of where things stand right now. Eric Morgan : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question today comes from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Jason Seidl : Yeah, thank you, Robert. Hey, gentlemen, good morning. Appreciate the time. You brought up Estes issues that they had last year that sort of grow sort of beyond normal tonnage numbers for you in October of '23. Should we expect then that by November and December the tonnage comps get easier so we're not probably really looking at sort of down as much as we're seeing in October? Adam Satterfield : Yeah, I think that's fair. I think the October, is definitely the toughest comp when I go back and look at last year's sequential performance in November versus October, our tonnage was down six tenths of a percent. And our 10-year average there is a 3.1% increase. And then December outperformed. We were down 4.8% in December of '23 versus November of '23. The 10-year average there is 7%. So, I think that this is probably the toughest comp, if you will, of the quarter in October. But depending on how November trends, if we get some acceleration back in the business. And then obviously December is always a tough month for everyone given the holidays and whatnot. But if we can kind of hang on, we had a little bit of outperformance there. So December will be a little bit tougher versus the November. But I think on the whole, as we go through this fourth quarter, this feels like we're finally getting to what we hope is a floor. We're encouraged about how things are trending. It's good to see the sequential performance thus far in October and obviously it got many days to get through this quarter. And 1Q is also tough to think about from a big picture standpoint. We've been underperforming normal sequential trends for about two and a half years now. So, it certainly feels like we're finally coming to the end of a cycle. We've got to go through these tough quarters, but we finally have seen, I think traction with respect to interest rates are declining. We'll have the uncertainty of the election behind us pretty soon. And so hopefully we get back to seeing some growth for our industry for which typically when the industry starts to inflect to the positive, that's when our model shines the brightest and we win the most share. So, we're looking forward to getting through this final quarter here of the year and starting out next year with hopefully some good strength. Jason Seidl : No, I hope so too out of it. And with the year-over-year comp in October for Estes, did that impact the weight per shipment at all? Could you remind us? Adam Satterfield : The weight per shipment last year? It was pretty much right in line with what our normal tenure average would be. So we were, in October last year we were down three tenths of a percent and then pretty much performed about in alignment with what normal weight per shipment would trend. Typically, you'll get a little bit of an increase in weight for shipment from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. And that's something that actually was a little bit of a surprise for us in the third quarter our weight for shipment ticked down a bit. And July was somewhat consistent. And I'm speaking of this year now, July was pretty consistent, consistent with our 10-year average. But then it dropped further in August, came back a little bit in September. But overall kind of underperformed what the weight would be. But at this point we've actually in October seeing a bit of an increase. So, typically the 10-year average in October, like I just said, is down three tenth. So, if we're seeing a little bit of an increase, that's obviously a good thing for business as well. We're getting more weight per shipment, going to have a little bit higher revenue per shipment as well. And that generally drives improved productivity also. And hopefully that generally has been a sign of hope with respect to the economy as well. So that would be another metric to continue to watch to see if we see things start to pick up for us. Jason Seidl : Right. Well, listen, I really appreciate the time and color guys. Operator : Our next question today comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Yeah, hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. I want to follow up maybe on the near-term trend. So, it seems like LTL yield growth has moderated a bit across the industry. I appreciate the tonnage update for October, I guess. Adam, could you share some color on how you see yields shaping up here into the fourth quarter and then more broadly, if the macro remains this week, I guess do you expect to see any irrationality in the market that would make it harder for you guys to keep realizing price increases above inflation or how is your price realization going as you talk to customers? Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Yeah, I was pleased with our yield performance through the third quarter. And it takes having superior service to support what we're able to achieve consistently year in and year out from a yield performance. And so, we're really, really proud of the service metrics we've been able to deliver. And just to repeat, winning that Mastio award for the 15 straight years, hopefully has put to bed some of the faults that that gap between us and our competitors has closed and so really pleased to see that performance with this year's results. But I think at the end of the last call we talked about normal seasonality with respect to our revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges. And that would have put us in the 4% to 4.5% range for the third quarter. And we came in at the top end of that range and granted we had a little bit lower weight per shipment as just was referencing with Jason. But so that certainly helped the revenue per hundredweight. But to me it just seemed like consistent performance through the quarter and that's what we would continue to expect. Our yield management process is we take a long-term and consistent approach that tries to offset our cost inflation and support continued investments in our network and in our technologies and so forth. So, if normal seasonality plays out for the fourth quarter, that would put that revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel, up in the 3.8% to 4.2% type of range. And we'll continue to watch that as we go through, but we expect to continue to get increases. We're seeing it, we've seen it throughout this year and really throughout the last two and a half years that we've been in this weak economic period and so just continue to execute on that consistent philosophy and we're getting increases as we go through bid renewals and that would be the same expectation as we go through this year and would be the same as we go through next year as well. Daniel Imbro : Appreciate all the color. Best of luck, guys. Operator : And our next question today comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. I just want to follow up on that last question. So, I think, Adam, your October update is that total yields were negative and I guess you're talking about yield ex-fuel up, call it 4%. So, this drop off in yield is entirely fuel. I know fuel is down, but I just want to make sure that that's right. And then just to ask it sort of directly, like are you seeing more pricing competition, irrational pricing? There's certainly more concern about that in the market right now. Are you guys seeing it or not? Adam Satterfield : Yeah. Just to address, October and we didn't give the exact number, but you can kind of back into it. the revenue per hundredweight with fuel, right now is trending down, but a lot of that is fuel related. Fuel at this point is down about 20% compared to October of last year. So, a bigger drop, if you will, compared to what we just saw in the third quarter and that should moderate as we progress through the fourth quarter. It was about $4.50 a gallon last year in October, but ended up averaging about $4.25 for the full fourth quarter of last year. So that's something that will moderate a bit and anytime looking at one-month trends as well, given some of that disruption that we had last year, you had some mix issues going on and so forth. So, we would still expect to see that sequential trend play out like I just mentioned, and overall yields ex fuel being up in that 3.8% to 4.2% assuming mix stays constant. if we see a continued increase in weight for shipment, that could put some pressure on the reported yields, that revenue per hundredweight, but that would be a good thing. So, that's what we'll continue to watch. But I think that, with respect to the overall environment, we'll have to wait and see what the other carriers report and what their commentary is like. I can only speak for us, but the environment has been pretty stable all things considered this whole year and we've been able to continue to get our increases. And I think that proves the value proposition that we have and what we can offer shippers and being consistent with our approach. So, it hasn't impacted us, hasn't impacted our market share. Our market share has been flattish which as Marty mentioned earlier, it's typically what we see through a slower economic period. And so, I feel like we're well positioned with what we've done, how we've executed, managed our costs, managed our operating ratio through this last couple of years and feel good about our positioning whenever we can turn the page back to having a little bit of economic tailwinds for a change. It feels like we've been running against the wind for a long time now and we're ready to see things start to turn around and give us a little bit of help from an economic standpoint. Scott Group : Makes sense. Thank you guys. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jordan Alliger : Yeah, hi. Morning. Yeah, I know from a high-level standpoint, hopefully we are bottoming from a trend perspective. I'm just curious, are there any pockets of your customer base, whether it be retail, manufacturing, wholesale or distributor, where maybe you could point to even being some favorable volume or is it pretty much not the case? And then secondly, if we have normal seasonality from October, I think we're kind of running normal September to October. If we run normal seasonality through the balance of this quarter, is there a way to think about where tonnage could shake out in aggregate year-over-year for the quarter? Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Yeah. From a breakdown of the revenue base, I mean, as you can imagine, we're seeing better performance with our retail related customers and continued weakness with our industrial related customers, which the industrial for us is 55% to 60% of our revenue. So that's certainly showing in our numbers and the decrease that we've seen. But I think ISM has been down for 22, 23 months now. And that's been the challenge that we faced over this last couple year period. But the retail has performed a little bit better. really the one thing that if you look for a bright spot would be our third-party logistics customers. 3PL represents probably a third of our revenue and we actually saw some revenue growth with our 3PL customers in the third quarter. So, to me that's a good trend because we've talked in recent quarters that we feel like there's been some modal shift that has been happening over the, I would say especially last year when that large competitor close their doors. I think people were just trying to find a home for freight and in many cases, many LTL shipments might have ended up in the truckload world. A lot of times we'll see that movement back and forth between modes, especially with the 3PLs. And so now that we're seeing an influx of business coming back in, I think whatever outflow was going, the tide is finally coming back in. And so, if we can see a continuation there, that should mean a good thing as we project out and start thinking about 2025. So that's probably the brightest spot to pick through the different customer base. Jordan Alliger : Thanks. And then again, just any thoughts on normal volume seasonality from here for the balance of the quarter where that could kind of maybe shake out for the whole quarter? Adam Satterfield : Yeah, I mean we're a long way from there. But if we were to hit normal seasonality, that would put tonnage per day down like 6.5% to 7% for the full quarter. If you just look at kind of bigger picture, revenue, revenue per day at seasonality would be at about $1.4 billion. And we've been underperforming seasonality like I mentioned, for the last couple of years. So, if you kind of take that normal rate of underperformance, at least where we were in the third quarter, it'd be down like $1.35 billion. So, it's something to just keep in mind as we progress through the quarter and give our full updates. obviously the revenue per day in October is, it should look the worst. And then hopefully things from a comp standpoint just start looking better overall as we get into November and we'll give our mid quarter update that will help you all clean up your models from there. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Operator : Again, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And our next question today comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Jonathan Chappell : Thank you. Good morning, Adam, you kind of mentioned at the end of one of your answers the uncertainty around the election. And this is a narrative that we've heard just a little bit recently about shippers maybe kind of pausing until there's a little bit more certainty. I know you have a very diverse end market of customers, but is there any way to kind of frame out what may be a temporary pause versus just the ongoing kind of industrial macro headwinds that you've been facing for the last several quarters? Adam Satterfield : Yeah, I think that, obviously anytime you have uncertainty and typically when you look in election years, they haven't been the best freight years at least in recent history. And so, I think that there have been plenty of headlines and we've had customer conversations as well where, people are being a bit conservative right now and until they know what, things may look like and what impact to their business, new policy directions may take. So, I think that's something that is temporary, especially right now. But at some point, people have got to get back to looking at their business and how ultimately, they want to figure out how to grow and expand and do the things that creates freight, that will create opportunities for us. So, I think that's something that, once we can get just this level of uncertainty, that's one more thing that has kind of been potentially holding the economy back, at least for the last quarter or so. So, we get past that and start taking interest rate cuts taking effect. I think people will get back as long as we have a healthy consumer and, we're a consumer driven economy and people are buying things, inventory balances get drawn down and there's got to be replenishment at some point. And so, we feel like that inventory scale has been drawn down. And once we sort of re normalize, if you will, we'd expect that we'll be able to pick up quite a bit of freight. Jonathan Chappell : Thanks, Adam. Operator : And our next question today comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ken Hoexter : Hey, good morning. So Adam and Marty, it sounds like a consistent top line, but fixed costs are starting to run. Is there anything you can or want to do at this point to cut those costs? Maybe shed some excess capacity? Seems like that's bearing down on the industry. And just to clarify your OR comment, was that 300 to 350 basis point sequential deterioration? So, you're talking about a 75 and a half to low 76 type of number for the fourth quarter? Adam Satterfield : Yeah, that's correct, Ken. That was the sequential guidance from the quarter that range. But, we're taking action every day and we keep our belts tight year in and year out in good times and bad. I think that if you don't know how to manage cost, if you don't manage cost in good times, you probably don't know where to start when times are tough. I think that's a lesson I learned years ago. So that's an ongoing focus for us and our team and we stay on top and have metrics from a productivity standpoint that we're always staying on top of. Our team's been very effective this year in that regard, especially when you've got a lack of density in the system. And we've expanded the system a little bit, opening five or six terminals this year. So, in the third quarter especially, we had an improvement in our platform shipments per hour. We had an improvement in our pickup delivery shipments per hour. So, some improvements there in the third quarter. Despite the volume weakness, our load factor from a linehaul standpoint has continued to face some pressure. But again, that's volume weakness and it pretty much was down in alignment with what the decrease in weight per shipment was. So, it's not atypical to see that type of performance. But to us, the most important thing is to keep giving service and running our schedules. And that's why in slower periods it can create a little bit of a cost headwind for us. But, we think it's more important to keep giving service now than ever. And so that certainly has supported the value proposition over time. with respect to our overhead cost. Yeah, those, those have been about $300 million to $305 million each quarter this year. And we look at ways and control discretionary spending. I think that in regards to cutting back on capacity, we want to keep our eye out for the long term. And we still believe in the fact that we've got a long runway for growth ahead. And that was why we expanded and executed on a CapEx plan like we did this year. Probably we'll cut back, would expect, cut back our capital expenditures into next year and grow into some of this capacity that we have. But we will look to continue to add to the network over time just due to the confidence that we have and what our market share potential can be. But probably tighten up our fleet and do some other things like that that will help with cost as we go forward. But the biggest thing will just be getting back to revenue growth. And when we think about you look at historical performance, whenever we do get into an upswing, we've had some significant revenue growth years and it's usually two years coming out of a down cycle. And whether you look at 2010, 2011, 2017, 2018, '21, '22, that's going to be where this investment through the cycle pays the biggest dividends for us. So, if we get back to having a stronger economy and get back to the market share outperformance like we've seen in the past, I feel really good about where our operating ratio is today and where it can get to with respect to those overhead charges scaling back down to where they've been as a percent of revenue, we're about five operating points. Overhead cost as a percent of revenue higher than where we were, say, back in 2022. So, there's a lot of opportunity to get us right back on path to achieve that sub-70 annual operating ratio goal that we still have. Ken Hoexter : Great, thanks. Appreciate the thoughts. Operator : Our next question today comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Thanks, morning everyone. Can you share a few more details on your thoughts on this Mastio survey? I mean, you've long said that you're not hearing from your customers, that the others are closing the gap as much to you guys, as much as maybe that the narrative is out there and can we see some of that in the results as well? But is there a risk that if they're not closing up on service, they can maybe get more competitive on price? Or does it just take time for that service gap to close? So what do you think happens from here? Adam Satterfield : I think that's a question for the other carriers, and I don't know what their strategies are. I know what we've heard they were, and that's why we were pleased with the results this year. And that sizable gap between our performance and the others was maintained. And so, we're not going to sit around and rest on our laurels, though. We're going to continue to look for ways that we can get better. And like Marty said earlier, there's more than just to service, than just picking up and delivering freight on time. And so, there's 28 different attributes that Mastio measures, and we want to be the best in each of those. And so, we'll keep working hard to deliver solutions for our customers. And so, we've had a, have had a proven strategy that has worked for many, many years. And, we want to keep that model going and keep producing the same type of profitable growth and shareholder value that executing on this same long-term strategic plan has produced for us over time. I think it continues to work in the future. Whatever temporary decisions other carriers make, we've dealt with it for years, and I think it's something we'll continue to be able to work against as we go forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Adam, I wanted to ask about the relationship between truckload and LTL that your comments about 3PLs was pretty interesting. We've historically seen share move back and forth, but I guess through this cycle it seems like maybe more share than normal has moved back to truckload. And obviously the pricing dynamic between LTL and TL is maybe as wide as it's been in terms of the relative price, I guess, does that change anything through the next up cycle or do you think it doesn't really take a significant upturn in truckload to be able to push volume back into LTL? Obviously, you mentioned that you saw a little bit that happening in the third quarter. Just kind of curious how you think about that relationship these days. Adam Satterfield : Yeah, I think that obviously last year was very unusual with what happened and helped support the truckload world, gets pretty volatile with respect to the volumes and the pricing and so forth. And I think it's because of how fragmented that industry is. And so that created some freight opportunity. And on the one hand, customers just had to get their freight moved as well. And Yellow was hauling 50,000 shipments per day, picking up and delivering 50,000 shipments per day, and that freight had to go somewhere. It went to a lot of the remaining LTL carriers, but much of that I felt like, went into that truckload world as well. And we've heard people talking about consolidating shipments if they could and using truckload for zone skipping and doing some different things to try to take advantage of that lower rate environment there. But at the end of the day, if a shipment is less than 10,000 pounds, it makes more sense to be in the LTL world. And I think that that freight will come back to us in due time. Those truckload carriers don't love doing multi stops. They can charge a stop off fee for it, but that really makes sense when they're designed to really go from a to b with a full trailer. So, I think that freight does probably swing back into the LTL world maybe a little more aggressively than what we've seen through prior economic cycles. When I look at overall the data that we get on the universe, LTL shipments are down. Tonnage is down about 15% from the peak in the second quarter, 2021. So, some of that was economic loss, but I think some of it is this modal shift that we've seen and heard about as well. So, I think that whenever that kind of wave starts coming back in, I think that'll be something that will be a good opportunity for us, but directly, but then indirectly as well, it usually is going to other competitors, and those competitors end up having service issues with existing customers, and many of those customers come to us as well. So, I think that whenever we see this cycle inflection, I think we've got multiple fronts that should help us from a volume standpoint. Chris Wetherbee : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick clarification, did you see any impact from the hurricanes on the network, either yours or some of your customers? And should that start to pick back up here, perhaps in the fourth quarter and then looking into next year, another way to look at pricing, I guess the NMFDA is looking at making some changes to the class system. I think it's going more dimensional based. It's related to the effect in the middle of next year. I don't know if you got any early comments on that in terms of implications for yourselves for the industry and perhaps the shippers as well. Thank you. Adam Satterfield : Yes. We definitely had some revenue loss related to the hurricane. And operationally, it presents some challenges as well. We were initially pleased that all of our employees got through, everything okay from everything we understand from a health standpoint as well as property standpoint. Our network was fine as well. I think we were lucky in the sense of none of our properties really suffered any significant damage. We were down for a bit, which is typical when you have big major storms like that move through, but have recovered since nicely. And there will be some ongoing disruption operationally, though, some of the interstate systems in Western North Carolina, that will continue to be impacted perhaps up to a year before some of those roadways are repaired. So that's something that our operating team though does a phenomenal job, our line-haul management team of looking and figuring out how we need to rework the system to make sure that we've got freight that if something has picked up in Eastern North Carolina going to California and any point in between, we get that freight move seamlessly and within our service standards. So pleased with respect to how the team responded to the challenges from those storms that came through. And remind me again, what was the second part of the question? Brian Ossenbeck : Yes. It's looking at the NMFDA, we're looking at some changes for the class system mid-2025, just thoughts on that? Adam Satterfield : That's, I think, a good opportunity for us. We already -- we've got dimensioners in most of our major service centers, and we're already dimensioning probably 75% of our freight today. And so that's something that we're already set up to be able to effectively accommodate. So, we'll continue to work with customers through those changes that got delayed a little bit into next year, but that's something that we'll be able to handle and may provide another strategic advantage for us against some of our competitors. Brian Ossenbeck : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Ari Rosa with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Ariel Rosa : Hi Adam, Marty, Jack, just curious to hear your thoughts on the buyback. It's up quite a bit from last year. You still have a fairly modest dividend at under 1% yield, and it looks like you're obviously directing most of your capital towards the buyback as opposed to the dividend. I'm just curious what the logic is for favoring the buyback over the dividend? And is there any indication that management essentially is saying that they think the share price is undervalued? Adam Satterfield : Yeah. Well, the buyback was the first type of capital return program that we started back in 2014, and that was when our cash flow model was changing, and we were generating excess cash, and we still look today for the first use of cash would be for reinvesting in the company with the strong returns on invested capital that we have at 30%. But secondly would be the buybacks, and that was, as I just said, what we started with. And then we implemented the dividend program in 2017 to kind of round out all the respective requests, if you will, and preferences of different shareholders. But the buyback is obviously a tax-efficient means and provides a lot of flexibility with respect to returning capital. When we still feel like we've got quite a bit of investment ahead of us, and we're generally still spending 10% to 15% of our revenues on capital expenditures every year, but having that flexibility on the buyback will allow us to step that CapEx number up meaningfully if we needed to, based on what volume demands were and market share trends continue to be. But yes, we -- in the second quarter was really when we spent the most on the buyback this year. And some of that was just due to the stock weakness. We generally are pretty consistent quarter in and quarter out, but sort of take a grid-based approach with the consistent investment that we make. Buy more when stock's lower and less when it's higher, but consistently returning capital. But then we'll step in as need be when we see some big weakness like we did in the second quarter, and we ended up spending over $500 million in that period. And that was consistent with what we did back in 2022 as well, where the stock was under pressure, and we spent $1.3 billion that year on the buyback program. So that would be what our strategy going forward. We'll always be looking at -- we forecast outward cash flow from operations and what we think the capital needs for CapEx would look like and look at what the fixed dividend is and then that balance becomes somewhat of a target to spend on the buyback program each year, but some years may be less and some years more like what we're seeing this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Stephanie Moore : Hi, good morning, thank you. I was hoping you could maybe shed some light on the potential cyclical freight upside? So just kind of thinking through the dynamics, obviously, with truckload, we've talked about and seeing pricing was really soft, but I think that's largely capacity driven, not so much demand on the LTL front, obviously, where you guys are playing it down, but it also seems to be down from pretty high COVID comps that you throw and obviously, the bankruptcy of Yellow. So, as we kind of think about this eventual up-cycle, what evidence or kind of are you seeing or you think you could see that would suggest that we actually see kind of an inflection or above-average volume growth? Or are we simply just kind of returning to kind of a normal trend line in demand? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I think that weight per shipment is generally one of the first things that we would start seeing, and that's something that we've been down at historical lows, with our weight per shipment down below 1,500 pounds now. We've been as high as 1,600 pounds in our past. And so, we start seeing an increase in weight per shipment. Generally, that's orders for our customers' products are picking up. And so, there's more widgets on every shipment, if you will. And then eventually, there will be sufficient quantities to where that turns into multiple shipments, and so you start seeing it go from there. But that's usually the first indicator is on the weight side. Stephanie Moore : Got it. So, I guess what you're saying is you do believe that you should see some reacceleration here and this isn't just a multiyear normalization pattern? Adam Satterfield : Well, I think that, for sure, we've been in a longer slow cycle than any of us ever anticipated. Typically, when we go through a down period, it's three to four quarters and to be into this now for so long is probably somewhat skewed, as you mentioned, by COVID, creating a lot of acceleration. I mean we grew $1 billion of revenue in 2021 and another $1 billion of revenue in 2022. So maybe now things -- we've gone through a longer slow cycle after seeing a big up cycle there. But like I mentioned, I think that we're down. The industry is down about 15% from second quarter of 2021. The industry, if you go back to '09, it was on a pretty consistent growth path from '09 to '21, and ATA continues to suggest that there's growth opportunities for LTL. And we believe that as well. And we've seen the trends developing over time with e-commerce that effect on supply chains. If we continue to see near shoring and reshoring activities, that creates a lot of freight demand and opportunity for LTL. And so, we benefited from that over time and would expect that both the industry and ourselves will benefit from those trends. So, I think we've got to come out of the ditch, and we will, based on all the feedback that we have from customers and continuing those conversations, I think we get right back to some normalization. And then we'll see the industry continue to grow from there, and we'd expect that our market share will continue to grow as well. And we've increased our market share. We were at about 6% share back in 2012. And we're at 12% to 13% today. So, we've been able to significantly increase share and been the biggest market share winner really over the last 10 years. And service is what wins share. You got to have capacity, and there's been a lot of talk about the shift in capacity from the Yellow service centers that have been reallocated. But only about half of those facilities have been reallocated thus far. But once demand recovers, I think that you're going to see a more capacity-constrained industry and our service, winning share again for us into the future. So that's why we're committed to executing on our CapEx programs. And trying to invest ahead of that curve. And we're there right now. We've got about 30% excess capacity. That's more than we typically would have in our service center network. But that's what gives us confidence that once we start growing again, we can see those really strong incremental margins that we've been able to produce in the past and produce a lot of profitable growth. But it's going to take that inflection in the economy before we can get back to seeing those strong revenue growth trends and operating ratio improvement. Stephanie Moore : I'm sorry, just Adam, real quick, operating days in 4Q, if you don't mind? Adam Satterfield : Yes, we have 62 days this year versus 61 in 4Q of '23. Operator : And our next question today comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Bascome Majors : Adam, as we think about the profitability of the business as we get into next year, in a world that's been at best seasonal and a lot of times, sub-seasonal from a demand standpoint for quite some time now as you noted earlier. Can you level set what your view of a seasonal margin performance would be in the first quarter and even the second quarter, just so we can check our models? Thank you. Adam Satterfield : Yes. The first quarter is typically 100 basis points increase. And -- but again, that's if there's no real major adjustment from an insurance standpoint, the actuarial adjustments that we go through in 4Q to kind of normalizing for that. And then the second quarter is where we get the improvement. And that's where revenue is accelerating generally, and our operating ratio typically improves 400 to 450 basis points in the second quarter versus the first. And obviously, when we get into a period where you have -- not that I'm calling this now, but if we get into an environment, if you go back into a few years like 2017, for example, where if you can get above sequential revenue growth, and it gives more opportunity. To put it to the bottom line, the way our cost structure is split out now in the most recent quarter in the third quarter, our direct cost as a percent of revenue were about 52% and our overhead costs were between 20% and 21%. So, it's all that leverage that we have on those fixed costs when you get into that revenue growth environment that allows that operating ratio to swing generally in outperforming normal seasonality, if you will, when you're in those first year or two of the up cycle. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead. Thomas Wadewitz : Yeah. Great. Thank you. So, I wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts on kind of where you think pricing bottoms and then if inflation is may be acting differently this cycle? It seems like that's been a source of some pressure on margins. So, if you see shipments stabilize when you go into next year, do you think about we need 4%, we just need to keep getting that 4% in order to stay flat on margin? Again, if backdrop is a stability in shipments, do you get any help on inflation easing? Or is it like -- just how you think about maybe it's like a price cost spread question or would you think about price relative to maybe what you got in prior down cycles? Thank you. Adam Satterfield : Yes. That's a good observation, Tom. I mean that variance in revenue per shipment and cost per shipment over time, we've targeted trying to achieve 100 to 150 basis points of spread of price over cost to support the investment in capacity and technology and so forth. And that's effectively reconciled with what our long-term annual operating ratio improvement has been as well. Kind of what I was just saying earlier was that first year of recovery, you get the benefit of the volumes coming in. And so, it helps you from a cost per shipment standpoint, on the -- from an overhead side, you start getting all that leverage. But this year, we had started out, after seeing some inflation on cost per shipment. Our target for this year was to see cost per shipment core, cost for shipment inflation in the 4% to 4.5% range. And I think that's where we'll end up averaging for the year. And so, we're kind of back to normal, if you will. Our longer-term average has been 3.5% to 4%. And so, the volume weakness has kept us tad north of what that longer-term trend has been. But we'll continue to execute on a bid-by-bid basis. I mean our philosophy is to look at each customer as their bids come due and look at what the opportunities are and the profitability of the accounts and try to ask for increases that will offset our cost inflation. And so that -- those are the conversations that we have, and that's what we'd expect to continue to have whatever year the up cycle starts. The benefit and how we usually have really strong performance is all the new customers that are coming on board. And usually, that drives that revenue and yield trend a little bit stronger as well. And so those will be things that we'll look for whenever we do eventually get into that next part of the cycle where we're actually seeing some increases. But I don't think to your question about the floor, we look at every quarter just like we've done this year. As we progress through the year, mix is constant, we're looking for increases because our costs aren't going down. And so, we're looking to get increases, and that's what we'd expect to see sequentially quarter after quarter. Thomas Wadewitz : And you don't see a reason to think inflation is different kind of next year versus what you saw this year? Adam Satterfield : No, I think that we've got the opportunity and again, just looking at it on a per shipment basis, if we can get into some volume recovery, that's going to be the best thing that will happen. I mean long-term operating ratio improvement is produced by two main ingredients : density and yield. So, we've lacked on the density side. We've been consistent with our yield performance the last couple of years, and that is what has supported our margins. But once we can get the contribution from density coming through the network, that should keep some of those costs low. It comes through -- as I was referencing earlier, our team has done a phenomenal job of managing through in a lower density environment, keeping our service metrics high. And keeping those direct costs, I mean, in the first and second quarter, we had improvement in our direct cost as a percent of revenue. So, we've done a great job managing through in this down part of the cycle. But that's going to create a lot of opportunity. If you got higher weight per shipment, that's going to be more revenue per shipment performance when the cost to pick up is probably the same. The cost to move across the dock is consistent as well. So those are all those factors that will go in and why we generally see the cost per shipment kind of outperforming the longer-term average, if they will, when we get into those parts of the cycle. And they offset -- we've had tremendous inflation over the last couple of years. 65% of our costs are salaries, wages and benefits. So that's the biggest driver. But as we run an efficient network and can eliminate miles from our system, that's time and that's fuel. But we've had tremendous inflation with the cost of new equipment. Our maintenance and repair cost, on a per mile basis, they've been up significantly. We've managed that a little bit better this year. But insurance cost in our industry, premium costs have been double digits. I mean this is something that all carriers are facing, and we're not immune to it, but we've been fortunate to have operating efficiencies to offset many of these higher inflationary items that we've seen when you go line by line on the income statement. Thomas Wadewitz : Right. Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Bruce Chan : Hey, good morning, guys. Just want to wrap up the weight per shipment discussion here. Marty, you mentioned that you were getting fewer skids per customer. Is your sense that, that's all related to market softness? Are you seeing any pockets of others may be gunning for customer wallet share, especially as they've been improving service? And then maybe this is a little bit in the weeds, but any comments on sales force incentives that may be aimed at more business from existing customers versus new accounts that you can share with us? Thanks. Kevin Freeman : Sure. Yes. The reduction in weight per shipment is definitely our customers just shipping less boxes on a skid. So, we see that -- as Adam said, we're positive that will pick up in the -- maybe the fourth and first quarter as Christmas comes around and you got quite a bit of holiday shipping coming up. So, we're cautiously optimistic for that. And as far as sales incentives, we incent our reps on a quarterly basis based on revenue growth, operating ratio and service. So, we paid out in the last quarter, and we look to pay out in this quarter. So, they're incented pretty well to increase their business, and that's their main goals. So, I've got confidence in our sales team to go out there and sell our value proposition and gain additional shipments. Bruce Chan : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Kauffman : Thank you very much and Congratulations on the Mastio accolades. I think all the good questions have been asked at this point, but I'd like to drill down a little bit on tonnage. We do follow railroads and some other industries where they say, okay, well, this part of the economy was a little weaker this quarter, this part of the economy a little stronger. I'm assuming that the truckload multi-stop is more of a retail versus an industrial product. But if you look across your customer base, I know your comment was mix is consistent, but some customers ship heavier stuff, some customers ship lighter stuff. Where are you seeing pockets of weaker-than-expected activity in your customer base? Where are you seeing pockets of stronger-than-expected activity? Adam Satterfield : Yes. I don't know that -- we get very granular with how we look at our business and slice it by SIC code that generally just try to group generally together with -- as industrial and retail. But I don't know that we've seen anything that has varied greatly what our expectations would be. I think that like I mentioned earlier, the industrial performance has been weaker. Last year, it was probably holding up a little bit better than some of the -- than what the ISM trend would have indicated. But I think just -- some of that was due to we were continuing to win new customers, and we were getting some of the new customer activity. And we're continuing to get new customers in every month. We look at our reporting and the business that we've won or that we've lost, and we're continuing to win new accounts. And so maybe some of those have been more on the retail side, and that supported why retail has outperformed. But we've got certain commodities that we hold, that obviously are going to stay, a few or hauling food products, those are going to be consistent through the cycle, pharmaceuticals, things of that nature. And so, we've seen pretty consistent performance related to what we'd expect. Probably the thing that has been most positive has been the consistency of our market share. And I've been really pleased that we've not lost really any customer accounts. We've not lost lanes from customers. So, we've been able to keep those relationships intact. And we're primed and ready whenever those customers call and if they've got two shipments per week, once the orders for their products pick up, those two turn into three to four to five to 10 and all of a sudden, instead of making the stock, we're dropping a trailer and getting a full trail load of outbound product from a manufacturing account, that's kind of how this thing will take back off again when we start seeing increased order activity. But it's going to take some time, I think, to get there. And -- but we're primed in position. We've had continued to stay engaged. Our sales team does with our customers and to understand what their needs are. We're in the midst right now of going through. We -- this is the time of the year where we build a very detailed bottoms-up forecast to help develop what our strategic planning process to prepare for next year and what that will look like. And so, we're very engaged with our customers right now to understand what their needs from us will look like as we go into 2025. But like I've said kind of in response to multiple questions, there's -- we're not out of the woods yet, so to speak, but there are some reasons to be optimistic based on what our trends have looked like thus far in October. Being closer to the seasonality with respect to tonnage of October versus September, that's the first time that we've been able to say that for some time and to see an increase in weight per shipment, those are all positive indicators. And for what may come for the rest of this fourth quarter and then we'll see what next year holds. Jeffrey Kauffman : Okay, thank you for that answer and that\u2019s my one. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Adam Satterfield for any closing remarks. Adam Satterfield : Well, thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions, and feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and have a great day.

As a final note before we begin, we welcome your questions today but ask that you limit yourselves to just one question before returning to the queue. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference call over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Marty Freeman. Marty, please go ahead, sir. Marty Freeman : Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be more than happy to take your questions. Old Dominion's fourth quarter financial results reflect continued softness in the domestic economy. While our revenue declined 7.3% in the quarter due to a decrease in our volumes, our market share remained relatively consistent while we continued to strengthen our customer relationships. Although our fourth quarter earnings per diluted share of $1.23 represents a 16.3% decrease compared to the same period a year ago, I am proud of how our team continued to deliver superior service while also operating very efficiently despite headwinds from lower density. The past few years have been full of challenges within our industry, especially given the sluggish macroeconomic environment that has continued far longer than most of us would have anticipated. Through all of this, we have remained committed to the key elements of our proven long-term strategic plan, and I would like to thank our OD family of employees for their unwavering dedication to our core strategic priorities. While we have focused on what we can control, providing superior customer service, remaining disciplined in our approach to pricing, and controlling our costs by maximizing our operating efficiencies and minimizing our discretionary spending, we have also continued to invest in our network, our technology, and our people. As we strengthen our balance sheet, it allows us to remain focused on long-term market share opportunities. The consistency of our execution through the ups and downs of the economic cycle has been a key element in our ability to win market share through the years. Our customers know they can rely on us to be there for them and help them keep their promises to their customers. I am proud to report that once again, this was the case in the fourth quarter as we provided our customers with 99% on-time service and a cargo claims ratio below 0.1%. By consistently providing our customers with best-in-class service, we are adding value to their business, which in turn supports our yield management initiatives. Our long-term consistent approach to pricing, which focuses on individual customer profitability, is designed to help offset our cost inflation and support future investments in our capacity and technology. In the face of this challenging demand environment, our team has worked hard to control our costs and preserve our profitability by looking for ways to operate as efficiently as possible. As a result, over the past two years, our direct operating expenses have declined as a percentage of revenue despite headwinds from lower network density and continued cost inflation. This shows the flexibility of our network as well as the commitment of our entire team to match our direct operating costs to our business levels. Importantly, our efforts to control costs have not prevented us from continuing to invest in our business for the long term. We spent $771 million on capital expenditures in 2024, which follows the $757 million in capital spending we executed in 2023. These figures include $664 million we have invested over the two-year period in the ongoing expansion of our service center network. We opened four new service centers in 2024, and we also have several other facilities under construction or nearly complete that we can open quickly once the demand environment supports it. We have over 30% excess capacity in our service center network, but we know how quickly the market can change. These ongoing investments have created some short-term headwinds to our overhead expenses due to higher depreciation costs. That said, we are willing to incur these costs in the short term so that we are in a position to grow with our customers and support them with the capacity and technology they will require in the years ahead. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of our OD family of employees, I am cautiously optimistic as we start the fiscal new year. While we cannot predict when we will see an inflection in demand, we are well-positioned to respond to an improved operating environment when it materializes. Over the past decade, our consistent execution and commitment to superior service have allowed Old Dominion to win more market share than any other LTL carrier. We are confident that by continuing to implement our proven strategic plan, we are positioned to continue to win market share and drive increased value for our shareholders over the long term. I appreciate you joining us this morning. And now Adam will discuss our fourth quarter in greater detail. Adam? Adam Satterfield : Thank you, Marty, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue totaled $1.39 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024, which was a 7.3% decrease from the prior year. Our revenue results reflect an 8.2% decrease in LTL revenue per hundredweight. We also had one extra workday as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. On a sequential basis, our revenue per day for the fourth quarter decreased 2.7% when compared to the third quarter of 2024, with LTL tons per day decreasing 3.0% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 4.6%. For comparison, the ten-year average sequential change for these metrics includes a decrease of 0.3% in revenue per day, a decrease of 1.2% in LTL tons per day, and a decrease of 2.9% in LTL shipments per day. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the fourth quarter were as follows : October decreased 3.0% as compared to September, November increased 0.7% as compared to October, and December decreased 4.0% as compared to November. The ten-year average change for these respective months is a decrease of 3.1% in October, an increase of 3.1% in November, and a decrease of 7.2% in December. For January, our revenue per day decreased by 4.2% when compared to January of 2024 due to a 7.1% decrease in our LTL tons per day that was partially offset by an increase in our LTL revenue per hundredweight. LTL revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased 4.5% in January. Our operating ratio increased 410 basis points to 75.9% for the fourth quarter of 2024. The decrease in our revenue had a deleveraging effect on many of our operating expenses during the quarter, which contributed to approximately a 300 basis point increase. Within our overhead costs, our miscellaneous expenses as a percent of revenue increased 110 basis points, due primarily to lower gains recorded on the disposal of property and equipment during the fourth quarter of 2024. We generally expect our miscellaneous expenses to average approximately 0.5% of revenue, so these costs were more normalized in the fourth quarter of 2024. Our direct operating costs, which are generally variable in nature, also increased as a percent of revenue when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Contributing to the increase in cost was a 100 basis point increase in our insurance and claims expense as a percent of revenue, which was primarily due to changes in the adjustment recorded for our annual third of accident claims. We were otherwise pleased with our team's effort to control our direct costs in relation to current business levels while also maintaining tight control over discretionary spending. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $401.1 million for the fourth quarter and $1.7 billion for the year, respectively, while capital expenditures were $170.9 million and $771.3 million for the same periods. We utilized $142.5 million and $967.3 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the fourth quarter and the year, respectively, while our cash dividends totaled $55.4 million and $223.6 million for the same period. We were pleased that our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share for the first quarter of 2025, which represents a 7.7% increase compared to the quarterly cash dividend paid in the first quarter of 2024. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2024 was 21.5% as compared to 24.1% in the fourth quarter of 2023. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be 24.8% for the first quarter of 2025. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Operator : If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, at this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question today comes from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Marty and team, good morning. Marty, you guys talked about tonnage being down 7.1% here in January, but, you know, it's obviously been all over the news about the really bad winter weather conditions in parts of the country that, quite frankly, aren't prepared for bad winter weather. How should we think about sort of that tonnage number going forward as we move throughout the quarter? Should we expect that to get a little bit better? Or how much was weather impacted? Marty Freeman : Well, you know, we go through bad weather every January and February, it seems like in my career. And, you know, we get most of that revenue back when customers are closed down due to bad weather or causing carriers can't pick it up. It usually comes back in a couple of days. Some of it, you know, could be, you know, moved over to full truckload if they're able to, you know, build a full load from the ship dock. But most of that comes back. But, you know, to answer your question, it would depend upon, you know, what the weather is going forward. You know, we had some unusual weather here in the south where we live, and we never seen cold temperatures like that. We had a couple of snows, but I don't look for that to be a big issue with us going forward from a weather standpoint. And so I'm optimistic. We're almost out of the woods. It was seventy degrees here yesterday, so we love that. Jason Seidl : We're getting the bad weather up here. You guys give us any numbers in terms of the amount of terminals you guys had that closed down in January maybe versus the prior January to give us a better feel? Adam Satterfield : Yep. We don't normally get into that level of detail, Jason, but, you know, we obviously had service centers that were disrupted, as Marty said, and, you know, I think we always think about trucking as an outdoor sport. And so when we look at things like our ten-year averages, you know, there's gonna be bad weather that's built into those ten-year averages. We had bad weather in there in January last year. But we're pretty pleased with how we performed and what our volumes looked like in January overall relative to December. Our tonnage was a little bit under. We used the five-year average in December and January. We outperformed the five-year average in December by about a hundred basis points, and we underperformed by about a hundred basis points the five-year average in January. Usually, look at the ten-year average going forward. So tonnage ten-year average would be up one and about one and a half percent in February over January, and then the ten-year average in March would be a four point nine percent. So I think the key would be just we continue to perform and look and see how business levels deal throughout the month of February. And, obviously, this optimism we're hearing from customers and things like ISM finally going above fifty. And do those things really translate into increased business levels and see the acceleration that you would otherwise typically see or what we have seen over the last ten years. Jason Seidl : Yeah. Well, I got my fingers crossed for you guys. Appreciate the time. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jordan Alliger : Yeah. Hi. I guess maybe it makes sense to sort of ask since we talked about tonnage a little bit on the operating ratio and putting all the puts and takes together with tonnage and trends in January, how you're thinking about 4Q to 1Q seasonality on OR? Thank you. Adam Satterfield : Yeah. From an operating ratio standpoint, normally, we'd expect about a hundred to a hundred and fifty basis point sequential increase in the fourth to first quarter. For this year, I'm expecting that we'll probably be up kind of flat to up fifty basis points in the first quarter relative to the fourth. And, you know, we've got that insurance that was called out in the press release. We should see some improvement in those costs as a percent of revenue. I'd expect those costs to be closer to about one and a half percent of revenue in the first quarter or so. You know, that kind of otherwise would offset that normal sequential increase that we've seen. And so kind of that flat to up fifty, I still think, you know, we've got a little bit of a risk to revenue in terms of we're not quite yet there. We haven't had a period where we've been at seasonality for a full quarter. So we'll see, you know, what transpires as we continue to go through the rest of this quarter, but if we have a little underperformance there, then that puts a little bit more pressure on our overhead cost. I'm also expecting that our op supplies and expenses as a percent of revenue will be a little bit higher in the first quarter relative to the fourth as well. So but, you know, just like we did in the fourth quarter, really pleased with our performance there. We outperformed on a core basis what otherwise that normal seasonality would have been. Despite the, you know, what the top line dictated for us there and, you know, I think that just is a testament to our team and, you know, the focus that we have every day on managing our operating efficiencies and continuing to keep our belts as tight as we can and controlling discretionary spending. So had very good cost performance and control through 4Q and would expect that we'll see some of that continue into the first quarter here until we really get back to more of a robust revenue environment. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe if I could ask on pricing, kind of get a sense of maybe how you're seeing the environment. Fourth quarter revenue per hundredweight came in, you know, reasonably good. Sounds like maybe a little bit of an acceleration in 1Q, but could maybe help us sort of understand a little bit of what's going on from a pricing perspective, what you're seeing in the market? Adam Satterfield : Yeah. We're still getting good price increases. The revenue per hundredweight came right in line with pretty much that range that we gave for the fourth quarter. It was up 3.8% excluding the fuel surcharge. And so we were right kind of in line with where we thought we'd be from a normal seasonality standpoint. Starting out in good shape at the beginning of the quarter with what we've seen thus far in January, being up 4.5%. But normal seasonality would be we'd be up about 3.6% to 4% in the first quarter. So we'll see. We saw a little bit of a drop in weight per shipment from December into January that kind of helped that metric. I'm hopeful that we'll see that weight per shipment, you know, reaccelerate. And that's pretty standard to see January's weight per shipment be a little bit lower. But hopefully, we'll see that accelerate as we go through the quarter. That'd be more indicative of an improving economic environment. But, yeah, that's kind of what we've seen thus far at this point through January, outperforming that range that we somewhat expect from a normal seasonality standpoint. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jonathan Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Jonathan Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Marty mentioned in his prepared remarks several other service centers that are under construction or near completion. As we think about, you know, the outlook for this year, maybe not identifying the inflection yet, do we expect, you know, four service centers or less in 2025? And, you know, if we do get that inflection second half of the year, customer optimism seems to be on point. How many service centers are pretty close that you could bring on pretty quickly to kind of keep the spare capacity where you'd like for it to be? Adam Satterfield : Yeah. A lot of that's gonna be demand-driven, John. You know, we're at 261 service centers today, and we continue to execute on our long-term CapEx plan, really over the balance of the last couple of years, like Marty mentioned. And so we had four openings overall last year. And, as we look out this year, we're a little north of 30% from an excess capacity standpoint. So, you know, unless demand really dictates, we don't have to open any. In that regard, and we would be diligent in looking at the properties that we may finish construction on. And making that decision operationally whether or not we want to turn that new location on, if you will. And there's a lot of cost that goes hand in hand with a service center opening. It's not just the facility cost themselves, but it's working them into an operational plan and the impact of line haul operations and all the other incremental costs. So all of those would be factored into the decision as to whether or not we would want to open. But we've got, I think, several that are near completion now, and I think we would have several more. So that we could finish here in 2025. So that number that you mentioned, you know, we could open that many if demand dictated, but we're just gonna be, you know, sort of prudent with making those decisions. But what we can say is, you know, I think we've done continue to execute according to what our long-term plan has been, and that's making the investment anticipated growth curve. We're confident in our continued opportunities ahead for market share, and we want to make sure that we prepared our network and our people to be ready when those volumes do in fact return to us and should return at a very strong incremental margin. So, you know, that's something that we're in great shape for. And we'll continue to, you know, evaluate those projects, but we can handle a lot of business right now, but we want to be prepared. You know, you think back to how things changed quickly in 2021, 2022, we put on a cumulative $2 billion of revenue over that two-year period. So I think we're in a great spot from a network standpoint that we could go through a robust economic expansion and put on a lot of good, strong revenue. Marty Freeman : And John, to add to Adam's comments, two of those facilities that we're working on now and trying to complete are hub facilities, which will actually lower our cost in the future from a line haul standpoint. So we're still very excited that those things are near completion and that'll give us some further savings down the road. Jonathan Chappell : Great. Thanks, Marty. Thanks, Adam. Operator : The next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Adam, maybe to follow-up on an earlier comment you made. So demand has remained muted, but we did see PMI kind of return to expansion this month. Can you just talk about how long it typically takes for that to show up in terms of more shipments moving into the network? And what are the earliest of your business that do typically inflect higher in a cycle? Are you seeing any encouraging demand from those customers when you look across your portfolio? Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Yeah. We actually, in the fourth quarter, saw our industrial business, for the first time in a while, outperform our retail-related business. And the revenue performance with those industrial-related customers is actually a little bit better than the overall company performance. And, you know, I think that kind of goes hand in hand with the enthusiasm that we're hearing from customers today. And, you know, albeit it's everyone, I think, is being a little bit cautious with it. But we saw the acceleration in ISM in December and didn't quite break the fifty threshold, but we felt like based on customer conversations that we would see it bust through fifty in January, and, you know, that's where it ended up being. So, yeah, I think that we'll just continue to stay engaged with those customers and obviously be there for them when they need us. And we'd love to see increased business levels with our industrial-related customers. Typically, it's a couple of months lag when we see that performance with ISM. In terms of the acceleration coming through, I'd say, for the industry overall. But certainly, we're in a great spot to take those increased shipments, you know, if they materialize. Daniel Imbro : Appreciate all that color. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Morgan with Barclays. Please go ahead. Eric Morgan : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask another on operating ratio. Just given the cost performance this year and where you see pricing trending, and I don't know, maybe you see a little bit of DNA or less of a DNA drag with CapEx coming down, do you think you can get to margin improvement this year if we are kind of in a steady state macro, or do you think you need to see some positive inflection here? Adam Satterfield : Well, I definitely think that's gonna be dependent on the top line. Revenue. And, you know, we've talked about a lot of the OR degradation that we saw this past year, it really was in the overhead expenses line. We actually generated a slight, but just a little bit of improvement in our direct cost as a percent of revenue for the full year. So I was really pleased again with our ability to control what was controllable in a low-density environment while actually improving our service standards. So that's a testament to our operations team for how they handled and managed through this. So really pleased with that, but we did see the inflation there and those overhead costs, and, you know, they've been averaging about $300 million per quarter overall, plus or minus, kind of $5 million. And when you go through that allocation. So, you know, we've got to get back to a point where we've got some top-line growth. I think that if we can see some return to seasonality, then that's certainly possible. I think if you match seasonality or kind of trace it through the four quarters of this year, I can see back to or you get into the back half of the year in particular, fourth quarter, you can see some nice improvement overall in revenue, and I think that, you know, if we do our job and continue to control our cost, you know, it's certainly possible to get back to an environment where we can have some improvement. But, you know, I kind of look at this as it's gonna be a multiyear type of story in the sense of when I think we see the economy really rebound and you go back to some prior periods, like 2017, 2018, you know, it's gonna happen at some point, and it's called a cycle for a reason. Right? So whenever it does come through, you know, what's the leverage can we get on the revenue growth? And, you know, I think we can look at the breakdown of our operating ratio for the year and think that if our total direct cost for the year were between 52, 53% of revenue, overheads 20% to 21% of revenue. You run the math, that's a pretty strong incremental margin if we can just manage those two components. And that's where we'd expect to get the most leverage. If our overhead costs are about 21% of revenue, they've been 16, 17% before, so we can swing that pendulum back to the lower end of that kind of 500 basis point range that we tend to trade in. And see some really strong performance that should get us right back eventually towards our goal of producing an annual operating ratio below a 70. Eric Morgan : Appreciate the color. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So I just want to come back to the NMSTA, they're working through some changes to the class system. The proposal was out late last week. So got your thoughts on this last time, but I want to come back to it. I know you did mention a vast majority of your freight already, but that we've seen a little bit more on the table, terms of the proposal, what do you think the implications are for yourselves, your shippers, and for the broader industry, assuming this goes forward as proposed. Thank you. Marty Freeman : Yeah. I personally think it's a big to do about nothing really because, you know, basically, what they're wanting to do is go from a class rating system to a density and cube rating system. You know? So that doesn't necessarily mean that the shippers have to do that overnight. You know, they have the choice to go to that if they want. So I don't see that being a big deal. And how that will affect the carriers. Certainly, we would like to work towards that because it gives the carriers a better system to rate the shipments and cost the shipment, but I think it's probably a lot of hype over nothing for the time being. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. Appreciate that, Marty. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ken Hoexter : Hey, good morning, Marty and Adam. Just maybe just sounds like a deceleration in the market if you're saying you're maintaining share volumes down seven percent, eight percent versus I think you were talking maybe more mid-single digits last quarter. Can you talk about that and your market share? Do you usually maintain it point in the downturn, you only get the pickup in the upturns? Then, Adam, just a real quick clarification. I think you mentioned OR up fifty to a hundred basis points. I thought last time you had mentioned the normal 1Q seasonality was a hundred to a hundred fifty. So does that mean you're looking to beat historical trends, or has the historical trend changed? Or just trying to get an update there. Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Yeah. Let me make sure I clarify that. So the normal increase is a hundred to a hundred and fifty basis points. And I was saying that we should be flat to up fifty basis points from the reported operating ratio in the fourth quarter and part of that is the benefit of that insurance and claims expense that was 2.9% of revenue in the fourth quarter. We expect that to revert back to around 1.5% in the first quarter. So you got some benefit there and then some increases that I had mentioned earlier. But you're right. The normal average is a hundred to a hundred fifty basis points of an increase there. You know, in regards to your market share commentary, you know, I think that the thing that we've been looking at overall, obviously, there was a lot of disruption over the last couple of years. We're trying to look at share. Of just comparing the publicly traded carriers. So we've had to try to look more at the entire universe and some of the data that we get that includes private carriers overall. And so we would say that in 2023 and 2024 as well, from all the information we get, it looks like we have maintained market share. And, you know, that's effectively what we target doing. In a weaker economic period, we want to maintain our market share, continue to maintain discipline. With regards to our yield management philosophy as well, and then being in a good spot to start growing when the market does again. And, you know, I think that's what you see in the expansionary markets. We've outperformed the at least the public carriers. Buy anywhere from, you know, six hundred to eight hundred basis points, if you will. So I think that we'll see that play out again. And, you know, only time will tell in terms of how the others are able to reshuffle capacity, if you will, and when the market continues to improve and the freight comes back. And overall, we see the industry volumes are down probably about fifteen percent. Versus where we were in 2021, 2022. So I think that's created some of those capacities that's out there, but that'd be all about who can control it. Without any type of growing pains and, you know, referenced it earlier, but we put on two billion dollars of revenue cumulatively over that 2021 and 2022 period. So I think we've got a proven team that can go out and execute and put on a significant amount of revenue growth, that'd be a top ten carrier just putting it on organically. If at least what we did in 2021 and 2022. Ken Hoexter : Great. Thanks, Adam. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Adam, last quarter, you sort of gave us a range of revenue outcomes. I don't know for the for Q4, right? I don't know if you have a similar thought around Q1. I'm just trying to understand if is revenue starting to outperform seasonality or if this is just sort of the OR comment is more about sort of the Q4 starting point. And then the yields ex-fuel are sounds like accelerating a little bit in January versus Q4. Is that a mixed dynamic or is that pricing starting to reaccelerate again? Adam Satterfield : Yeah. So in the first quarter this year, we would for to start, we've got one less operating day. We'll have sixty-three days in the first quarter this year versus sixty-four last year. But I guess the way I framed up revenue last quarter, you know, was kind of creating, okay, if we performed that seasonality, you know, what would that look like? And if we did that, in the first quarter, I think we did $1.38 billion of all-in revenue in the first quarter. But then kind of on the other, I gave if we in the fourth quarter, I gave if we underperform seasonality like we had in the third and the fourth quarter, what would that lower end of revenue range look like. And, you know, we did perform a little bit better in the fourth quarter than we did in 2Q and 3Q relative to what our ten-year averages were. But if we underperform seasonality kind of at that same pace, of the fourth quarter. Then first quarter revenue would be $1.34 billion. So maybe said more succinctly, somewhere a billion three four, a billion three eight would put us somewhere in normal seasonality range to kind of consistent underperformance like we had in 4Q. And I think that that's kind of like I was saying earlier, it's just we've typically you see a big acceleration in revenue. It starts, you know, here in February and then a big acceleration in March. And so, you know, that's still yet to be determined if we'll see that type of seasonal increase. Yeah. We're cautiously optimistic, I would say, in the sense that we felt like a year ago when we were sitting here, we felt like we were gonna see things turn to the positive. So, you know, we're being diligent and preparing for it. But we definitely want to see it transpiring before we get too far ahead of ourselves in terms of talking about what the top line and the operating ratio might otherwise be. That yield question that you asked just to kind of follow on to what I had said earlier. It's up 4.5%. Normal seasonality would imply that revenue per hundredweight X fuel would be up 3.6% to 4%. So it was a little bit of a drop-off in our weight per shipment. From December to January. So a little bit of mix. That kind of helped that number. But like I mentioned earlier, you know, I'd rather see our weight per shipment increasing and put pressure on that number, you know, naturally, then and get us back into that range, if you will, because that'd be more of a sign on the economy getting better, and we should see that follow through both with weight and shipment velocity as well. But, you know, we continue to do our thing in terms of executing on our long-term yield management philosophies and looking at individual account profitability and just trying to achieve increases that offset our cost, but also continue to the investments in new service centers and new technology that ultimately are designed to improve our customer service or enhance operating efficiencies that ultimately would allow us to better serve our customers. Scott Group : Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Bruce Chan : Yes. Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. Maybe just, you know, to get your thoughts around the big competitor spin-off that was announced at the end of the year last year, I know there's a pretty long runway on that, but maybe, you know, you could give us some color on how you see that affecting the competitive dynamic if it's maybe increasing on the margins or if you're confident that there's enough opportunity for everybody with potential cycle recovery. Adam Satterfield : Yeah. I think that, not to speak for another company, but I mean that company we've been competing with for years. And so, you know, it's something that we'll have to continue to keep watch of and see what their new go-to-market strategy might be if there is any change to it. But I think otherwise, as a standalone and brighter light, maybe shining on business, would expect to see, you know, continued discipline there. But, you know, I think that we've got when you look at us compared to each of our larger national nonunion companies, you know, you look on the Mastio surveys and we've won the Mastio quality award for sixteen years in a row, and that's something that we continue to focus on. We want to stay as the industry leader there in terms of total service but better yet, the ultimate value that we can deliver to our customer. And so I think it's that value proposition that really gives us the opportunity to keep getting share as we look out into the future. And, we've won more market share than anyone else over the last ten years, and we think we're better positioned than anyone to win more market share than anyone else going forward, but, you know, I think the opportunities there for the industry. Like we've said time and time again, there's opportunity for more than just us to grow. And we've been competing with other carriers for years that have been trying to grow their business, and we've been able to compete very effectively. And, you know, I still believe that we're a capacity-constrained industry. I think it was commonly understood that our industry was capacity-constrained in 2022, and, you know, I think that's something that's it's almost like daylight savings time you can't the old saying about taking two inches off a blanket and so you know, sewing it on the other end of the blanket. Give you a longer blanket. And when you had a carrier that exited the business, and only half of their service centers have been reallocated to other carriers, just because the logo changed on the door doesn't mean there's more capacity in the industry. It's actually less. So I think when we see volumes actually normalize and start growing again and taking advantage of the e-commerce opportunities, near-shoring opportunities, freight that lends itself to the LTL movement. I think that's when you'll see the entire industry start to grow again and us winning more than our share of the market. Operator : The next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Bascome Majors : Thanks for taking my questions. You talked earlier about looking at your market share from a broader data set including some of the private carriers. Can you talk about what segments of the market you think are gaining and losing share now that we've kind of settled out from all the noise of the yellow redeployment and the SD Cyber attack that were in comps for a while? Adam Satterfield : Yeah. I mean, it's kind of hard to parse through, and we don't get that granular detail for us and the industry. But we get a lot of detail and continue to see consistent performance throughout each of our operating regions. And, you know, I think we've seen, you know, in some cases, the retail was had been outperforming. And that was somewhat related to the weakness of the industrial market. And, you know, ISM had been below fifty for twenty-five out of twenty-six months, I think. So, you know, we saw that reflected in our business levels over the last couple of years. But all in all, as we've talked on each call, we've been able to maintain customer relationships, and we've not really lost any major customer accounts. It's just our customers have had fewer shipments to tender to us. But I think that that's probably allowed us to maybe see that better performance on the retail side. As you go forward though, I think that we should see our industrial business start picking back up again. We have already started seeing business that's managed by third-party logistics companies. That business is performing better over the last couple of quarters. And it's also we've seen an increase in weight per shipment with those 3PL customers as well. So, you know, we've talked before about we feel like, and Marty mentioned it, about some consolidation of loads that have probably moved into the truckload world. And shippers taking advantage of that environment where the capacity was there and the rates were really low. It seems like maybe the rate environment's improving a little bit in truckload and so we had back. Some of that freight should swing right back into the LTL. So, you know, I think we got multiple fronts that should create some volume opportunities, be it continued growth with 3PLs, industrial strengthening, the overall industry, strengthening and, you know, that truckload market as it gets better, that's gonna create LTL opportunities. But also, we've got a structural advantage against our other competitors. Many of our competitors use an awful lot of truckload substitution for their line haul network. And so when that rate environment starts increasing, their cost will be increasing so that they typically have to raise rates much higher than us in that type of environment. So, you know, I think that's gonna create some volume opportunities for us as well. Bascome Majors : And if I could ask a brief follow-up, there's a lot of focus on the largest player in the space as they become a standalone business over the next twelve plus months. How do you make sure you retain your talent as they're looking for new leadership? Marty Freeman : I think I'll answer that question. I think that you have to maintain that doing the same thing we've done for years and that's the OD family culture. You know, we treat our employees, our sales reps, very well. We pay them well. They have quarterly incentives. And I'm not overly concerned that that's gonna affect us in any way. Bascome Majors : Thank you, both. Operator : The next question comes from Thomas Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead. Thomas Wadewitz : Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Mike Tran on for Tom. So as we think about potential improvement in the macro, how do you view the impact of weight per shipment increasing on revenue per shipment? I imagine it's not a one-for-one impact, but is there a rule of thumb where you say, you know, fifty or sixty percent of the increase in weight flows through to higher revenue per shipment? Adam Satterfield : Yeah. That's a hard one to answer when you're, you know, spreading it over fifty thousand shipments per day. But, you know, I think generally speaking, obviously, the improvement that we'd see in weight per shipment leads to increased revenue per shipment. And so, you know, generally, that's gonna be, you know, better for the bottom line, if you will. The cost, all things considered, if it's just a few more widgets on every pallet, the cost to handle might stay the same. But, you know, it's I don't know that there's necessarily a one-for-one relationship that we can share. Overall, it obviously will be a good thing that we've been suffering. Our weight per shipment has been pretty low. In January, we were 1,489 pounds. And, you know, back in the 2021, 2022, and prior expansionary type periods, we've been around 1,600 pounds. And so there's a lot of good things that come with that higher weight per shipment. You know, it translates into better line haul efficiency. There's just a lot of efficiencies that come with that increased weight. So it's something that we certainly will continue to watch. And, like I mentioned earlier, that's usually a good sign of an improving economy overall. You know, and then typically, we'll lead into increased shipments with customers as well. And so just all kind of works to our advantage, you know, from a leverage standpoint. Mike Tran : Makes sense. Thanks, Adam. Operator : The next question comes from Ariel Rosa with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Ariel Rosa : Hi. Good morning. So I wanted to ask about inflationary cost pressures. Maybe you could just discuss kind of what you're seeing across the board, particularly insurance. We've heard from a number of carriers that they were seeing a lot of pressure on that insurance line item. And, obviously, here, in the fourth quarter, you saw a little bit of a step up there, which sounds like goes back in the first quarter. But maybe from a structural standpoint, you could talk about just where you're seeing inflationary cost pressures, level of confidence to get that back in pricing. And then just a clarifying question if I could on Bascome's question. Wanted to make sure I understand there are not non-compete clauses or anything like that with regard to any employees, whether senior management or salespeople, or is it just a function of the culture and the comp being sufficient that you're confident you can kind of retain the talent that you have. Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Yeah. Let me see if I can keep up with everything there. But from an inflationary standpoint, you know, we end up last year about where we thought we'd be from a core cost inflation. We had anticipated that after a couple of years of increases that we would see things kind of revert back closer to our long-term average, which would be cost per shipment in the 3.5% to 4% range. So we were a little north of that overall in 2024. And kind of expect to see a little bit higher cost inflation in 2025 as well. You know, thinking it may be more in that kind of 4% to 4.5% type of range. So just a little north of that longer-term average. But that's something that we'll continue to work on, obviously. But we've been seeing, you know, inflation in many items, health care costs, you know, fringe benefit cost overall, would expect to see a little bit increase there. The insurance specifically that you had asked about, that's been a challenge for years in the transportation industry for large companies in particular, and I think it hits, you know, the entire LTL industry, but probably the large truckload carriers as well. It's been incredibly difficult to maintain the insurance levels that we like to have. We've taken increased premium cost in the double-digit range for probably the past six years, and that's taken on a little bit more self-insured risk as well. And so that's something that, you know, we always try to manage through in our team. Legal and risk has done a great job to be able to continue to maintain the insurance coverage that we do have in place. But it's something where our accident frequency ratios are at an all-time best and, you know, we obviously invest in a lot of equipment on our trucks to try to mitigate accidents, and we invest an awful lot of money in training our people as well for safe driving practices. So that's definitely a key to our foundation for success. But that's something that I think continues to be a challenge until we can see tort reform in this country. And it's something that at some point has got to happen. You know, it's just it's crazy. Some of the cases that you can kind of read about that have happened to some of the carriers out there. Marty Freeman : And our sales turnover, to answer that question for you, is less than 1% a year. And most of that comes from retirement or promotions into operations or management. And it's not unusual for us to have other competitors to seek our salespeople, and they're smart to do that. Because our salespeople are trained to sell value, service, and not price. And we're proud of that fact. So again, you know, we hang on to our salespeople. They love working at Old Dominion because we treat them fair and pay them well. So that's the least of my concerns at least in our salespeople to a competitor. Operator : The next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thanks. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the insurance question. Is there anything more you guys can do from a balance sheet deployment standpoint to maybe kind of do more of that in-house? Or have you sort of maxed out how much you can do there internally to maybe offset some of that inflation with third-party insurers? And also quickly to follow-up, I think, Adam, you said earlier that you pointed out that only half of the yellow volume had come back online and so that's net reduction capacity, but you have also seen a lot of organic capacity growth in the industry over the last year and into 2025. Are you concerned that, you know, that might come in and backfill for the yellow capacity that's not yet come back online? Adam Satterfield : I think it's something that, you know, obviously, we'll continue to watch. What's going on in the industry. And like we've said, you know, I think it's gonna take going through an up cycle to really prove this is not the first time that in my career that I've heard that, you know, that other carriers are wanting to grow or they're adding capacity and that the growth story is gonna be over. I can recall hearing that back in 2016, and we've done a pretty nice job of being able to grow revenue from that point forward. But, you know, it's something that we obviously pay close attention to, and a lot of our confidence about market share comes from customer conversations more than anything. You know, staying in front of our customers, knowing how their business levels are changing, you know, what their strategies going forward are gonna be and how we can add value to their supply chains. And so, you know, we don't add capacity until we're confident that we're gonna be growing in the markets where we're expanding. And that's always been a key part of our expansion strategy. So, you know, I think that with getting to the up cycle, and then, that's probably gonna be the easiest answer to talk about, you know, where is industry capacity versus what our industry volumes looking like. But I don't see any change when we look forward. In terms of what our market share potential might be. Now versus the thinking that we had in place back in 2021, 2022. So we still feel like we've got a long runway for growth and a tremendous amount of opportunity out there ahead of us. And in regards to the insurance question, you know, I think we've done a really nice job in terms of managing those insurance costs. When you look at insurance and claims, on the income statement, it's pretty much been anywhere from 1.1% to 1.3% of revenue if you look back over the last kind of five to ten years, if you will, and it's something, like I mentioned, that we have had to take on some increased exposure. In terms of what our self-insured retention limits are and that's something that, you know, we spend a lot of time going through and planning. With our legal and risk teams to looking at and evaluating what type of risk do we want to take as we build out our insurance tower. And so, you know, there's a lot of strategy that goes in behind that. Obviously, there's no perfect answer. You look at things in hindsight and say, okay. We did this, and here was the result. You know, this year, we just had a bigger step up in terms of that the annual actuarial assessment that we complete in the fourth quarter. And took a little bit larger, you know, entry, if you will, to adjust those existing reserves on the existing claim. So but we do expect, you know, I think last year, we averaged about 1.2% of revenue for the insurance and claims, and I think that's probably gonna go up to closer to the 1.5% like I mentioned. So we'll see a little bit more inflation there. But all in all, I think we've done a very effective job of managing our cost for our insurance program. The other interesting thing that what goes in that line and where you've seen it improve over the long term is, you know, that insurance and claims line. That's our auto accident claims as well as our cargo claims ratio and, you know, our cargo claims ratio, which talked about for years, how we've generated improvement there and had got that balance down to point one. Well, it actually rounds to point zero point zero for this quarter. We just said below zero point one percent, but, you know, we talked about wanting to be on time and claim free. And in the fourth quarter, we were essentially claims free. So very proud of that achievement for the team as well, and it takes off a lot of investment in claim prevention and training and something we're really proud of. Ravi Shanker : Wanna ask you if you can get better than zero point zero, but thanks for the time. Operator : The next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Joseph Lawrence Hafling : Great. Good morning. This is Joe Haflin on for Stephanie Moore. Thanks for taking our questions at the end here. Maybe more of a thematic question. You mentioned, you know, maybe the tailwind of near-shoring. How do you guys view the Old Dominion network in relation to potentially sort of near-shore or on-shored production and manufacturing facilities? And maybe a curveball question, but we've been so focused on the organic growth front. Is there anything from an M&A standpoint as you guys look at the future of LTL that would maybe you in terms of beefing up your service offerings? Adam Satterfield : Yeah. You know, M&A hasn't been a priority for us. Our last acquisition was 2008. So we just feel like we've been able to grow organically with really strong return on invested capital. And so, you know, that will most likely be the focus as we go forward. Being focused on what we do best, which is LTL transportation and, you know, again, like I've said earlier, I think there's a lot of opportunity for the industry. And certainly, we feel like we can benefit the most given the quality of our network, the quality of our service, and a value proposition that's unmatched in our industry. And to that end, you know, we've got 261 service centers throughout the US. So we cover all locations, all ZIP codes, and so as plants are being built or expanded in the US, it creates an awful lot of opportunity. It creates opportunity on the inbound side where we're hauling parts and pieces and chemicals and so forth, raw material inputs, for the manufacturing process. And then we've got the opportunity on the outbound side to take those finished goods and allow the shipper to leverage our LTL network. We can drop a trailer at a customer location. They fill it and, you know, it's seamless through our LTL network. To get it to all points around the US wherever their customer base might be. So a lot of opportunity on both inbound and outbound as we see the potential for more manufacturing in the US. Or even, you know, from a near-shoring standpoint, if there is more in Canada or Mexico or whatnot, you know, we can get those goods as they come cross-border instead of goods coming into a port, it's more likely that we would get them cross-border and the freight could stay within an LTL network to get final destination. Versus being in a railcar and being pulled maybe to the middle part of the country before we would get our hands on it. So it just creates a little bit more opportunity across all fronts. Joseph Lawrence Hafling : Got it. Thanks so much. And just to just talk about, how much is cross-border as a percent of revenue for you guys? Could you remind me? Thanks. Adam Satterfield : Yeah. It's a pretty small percentage overall, less than five percent. Joseph Lawrence Hafling : Thanks so much, guys. And congrats. Operator : The next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tyler Brown : Hey, you guys obviously covered a lot. But, Marty, do you think a little bit of an off-the-wall question, but do you think that the change in the administration could be an opportunity for the ATA or really the broader LTL industry to revisit broader use of triples? I know that you used them out west, but that seems like a sizable opportunity. That's surmise linehaul's probably your largest functional cost bucket. Marty Freeman : Yes. I think that, Tyler, I think that yet to be seen by the new administration. I do see some positive things down the road for the new administration. Taxes is one of them, but as it relates to triples, other than Pacific Northwest, you know, that should have to be unseen. I think that's something that they talk about all the time at the ATA. I'm not sure, you know, how easy that will be to do. You know, one of the hub centers I mentioned earlier that we're building now, we'll be able to haul Rocky Mountain doubles on the turnpike, which will help our line haul from that aspect. But I think the jury's still out for triples in other areas, but hopefully, I would like to see that in some of the less congested areas in the future. Tyler Brown : Perfect. Thank you, guys. Operator : This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Marty Freeman for any closing remarks. Marty Freeman : Thank you guys very much today for your questions. We appreciate it, and please feel free to give us a call after the call, and we'll be glad to answer anything we didn't cover today. So thank you, and have a good week. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
