Prim - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Member of Risk & Compliance Committee Tony L. Wormington - President Analysts : Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division Michael Landau - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Operator : Good day, and welcome to today's Jack Henry First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to introduce Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Kevin D. Williams: Thank you, Latoya. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for the Jack Henry & Associates First Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO, and on the call with me today are Jack Prim, CEO; and Tony Wormington, President. The agenda for the call this morning will be as follows. Jack will start with an overview of the quarter from his perspective. Tony will then provide some operational highlights of the quarter, and then I'll provide some additional comments regarding the press release that we put out yesterday after market close. Then we will open up the lines for Q&A. I need to remind you that remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties. And the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our recently filed 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jack Prim. John F. Prim: Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2014. We are pleased to be able to report a very solid performance for the quarter. We saw a balanced performance, with continued strong sales across all brands driving 9% organic revenue growth and leading to a record revenue backlog. Our payments businesses continued to grow above industry average growth rates. Strong execution and expense control allowed us to expand our gross and operating margins nicely. Based on discussions with bank and Credit Union customers at our recent user conferences, we continue to believe that we will see slow but steady improvement in the economy in their businesses and, consequently, in our own. It was a good start to the year. We look forward to continued progress. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tony to provide some additional information on the business. Tony L. Wormington: Thank you, Jack. We remain very pleased with the contributions from all components of the support and services, which increased 10% in the quarter compared to the prior year quarter. The largest contributor continues to be our electronic payments revenue, which grew 15% for the quarter compared to the prior year period. Our outsourced data and item processing services increased 14% over the prior year quarter, and our in-house annual maintenance fees increased 2% over the prior period. In addition, our onetime implementation revenues were up 9% for the same period. Our electronic payments transaction volumes continued to experience very strong growth in the quarter. JHA Payment Processing Solutions transaction volumes for ATM, debit and credit processing were up 19% over the prior year quarter. Bill payment transaction volumes increased 16% over the prior year quarter. Financial institution merchants installed and utilizing our Enterprise Payment Solution increased to approximately 60,000 merchants, representing a 41% increase compared to the prior year quarter. Merchant-related transaction volumes increased 21% over the prior year quarter. Jack mentioned our banking educational conference the week of October 21. The event was well attended, with a comparable number of attendees to the prior year. In closing, I would like to thank our customers, our associates and our shareholders for their continued loyalty to JHA. I'll now turn it over to Kevin for a further look at the numbers. Kevin D. Williams: Thanks, Tony. Our total organic revenue increased by 9%, as Jack mentioned, for the quarter compared to the same period a year ago. Our license revenue decreased by 8% for the quarter, which -- this continues to be a lumpy line in our financial statements, compared to the prior year and represents 4% of our total revenue for the quarter. Our support services increased 10% for the quarter compared to the year ago and now represents 91% of our total revenue. The support and services break down into the 4 components, as we've mentioned before. Implementation services, a onetime fee, was $22.8 million and increased 9% for the quarter. Our electronic payments were $109.5 million for the quarter, which is an increase of 15%. Our OutLink data processing of $55.8 million was an increase of 14%. And our in-house maintenance was $81.5 million, with an increase of 2% compared to prior year. Our hardware revenue increased 6% for the quarter compared to prior year and represents 5% of our total revenue. Recurring revenue, which, again, is our electronic payments, our OutLink and our in-house maintenance, experienced a growth of 9% for the quarter compared to the prior year and represents 80% of our total revenue for the quarter. Consolidated gross margins improved to 44% for the quarter compared to 43% in the same quarter a year ago. License margins decreased to 88% this quarter from 92% a year ago due to increased sales of third-party software during the quarter. Our support and service margins improved to 43% compared to 41% last year due to continued strong growth in our payments and OutLink offerings while, at the same time, continuing to contain costs and leverage our infrastructure. The hardware margins improved slightly to 24% from 22% a year ago due to sales mix. To break this down into our 2 reporting segments, our Bank segment gross margins remained steady at 42%, and our Credit Union segment margins increased to 47% from 44% a year ago, which is primarily due to the increase in OutLink and our data processing and payments in the Credit Union segment. In the Bank segment, license margins decreased to 84% from 91% a year ago. Support and service margins for the Bank segment were steady at 42%. And the hardware margins in this segment improved to 23% from 21%. In our Credit Union segment, license margins were steady at 93%. Support and service margins improved to 44%, as I mentioned, due to the increase in data processing and electronic payments, which is driven by growth -- pardon me, and hardware margins increased to 26% from 25% last year due to sales mix. Our total operating expenses increased 6% for the quarter compared to prior year, with increases in all components of our operating expenses, sales marketing, R&D and G&A, which all increased about the same percentage. As a percentage of total revenue, operating expenses decreased slightly to 17% from 18% last year for the quarter. Our operating margin for the quarter increased to 26% from 25% a year ago, and our operating income increased 15% for the quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.5%, which is in line with the guidance we provided at the last earnings call, which was down slightly from 36% a year ago, which is primarily due to the timing of the R&E Tax Credit reenactment in January 2013, with no guarantees that we'll reenact it again this year, and it expires on 12/31 of this year. It's a tough comparable we -- in the second half, when we've got the full impact of the non-retroactive reinstatement this last fiscal year. Our EBITDA increased to $103.3 million for the quarter compared to $91.9 million a year ago, or a 12% increase. Depreciation and amortization expense of $25.9 million this quarter, with $13 million in depreciation and $12.9 million in amortization, compared to $24.2 million in depreciation and amortization this quarter last year. Included in the total amortization is amortization of intangibles from acquisitions, which was $5.2 million for this quarter, which is down from $5.6 million in the same quarter last year. Our operating cash flow for the quarter decreased slightly to $97.7 million from $101.8 million a year ago. Free cash flow for the quarter, calculated as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, of $7.3 million, which is up slightly from $6.8 million last year; capitalized software of $14.1 million, up slightly from the $11.6 million last year; and dividends of $17.1 million, up from $9.9 million last year. Our free cash flow decreased to $61.9 million compared to $73.4 million a year ago, which, obviously, the biggest contributor to this decrease in our free cash flow is the large increase in dividends that we did this last fiscal year. This equates to free cash flow per share of $0.72 for this quarter compared to $0.85 last year. Our in-house backlog, which represents contracts in hand for software, hardware and implementation services yet to be delivered is at $116.9 million, which is up 27% from last year. Outsourcing backlog, which is for the remaining life for current data and item processing contracts, was $386.3 million and up 17% compared to year ago. Total backlog up 19% compared to year ago and, remember, there is nothing in our backlog for any of our electronic payments businesses, which currently represents a little over 37% of our total revenue. We will reiterate the guidance that we provided previous for FY '14 as the first quarter was pretty much in line with our expectations. Top line revenue should continue in the upper-mid- to high single-digit growth range, with some ongoing leverage to our margins during the year. Obviously, as we all know, there could be some fluctuations due to sales mix. The results of this continued revenue growth and continued margin leverage should be operating income growth in the low to mid-double digits, which, obviously, this means continued leverage to our margins compared to prior year of probably about 100 bps for the year, which we saw that in the first quarter of the year. Our effective tax rate should remain at about 35.5%. Since we cannot predict the reinstatement of the R&E credit, obviously, if that gets reinstated, it will have a significant impact on our effective tax rate at the time the law passes. Therefore, as a result of this, our EPS should grow pretty much in line with the operating income growth in the low double -- low to mid-double digits due to the decreased interest expense primarily offset by the increased tax rate, because we paid our term note off at the end of last fiscal year. That concludes our opening comments. With that, I'll now open it up for questions. Latoya, would you please open the lines up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Dan Perlin of RBC. Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : I just wanted to ask a couple of quick ones. There seems to be increasing kind of talk around branch automation and branch transformation. And it's just not clear to me kind of in detail what role you guys play in that environment if, in fact, it does accelerate this year. Could you just kind of outline that a little bit? John F. Prim: Yes, Dan. This is Jack. Certainly, we have a number of branch automation solutions, whether it's teller automation or account-opening automation solutions. Most of the financial institutions have some type of a system in place for that. I think most of the talk around branch transformation really has more to do with the layout of their branches, the utilization of their staff typically empowering -- so rather than just have a traditional teller, there -- they might have somebody with a lot more ability to handle multiple issues, possibly make small loans up to a certain amount, those kind of things. So I think it's more of a branch reconfiguration typically into smaller space and redeployment of staff. There's some technology in some cases that's used, where somebody can kind of do self-service via video, kiosk or screen of some type back to a remote call center. So again, from the standpoint of a lot of additional upside in terms of additional product sales that we would have to facilitate that, the -- they're currently using the -- our products that would help to automate branches just -- probably just reconfigure and deploy them in a slightly different way. Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then the other thing is, and this is more of a bigger-picture question as well, it just seemed like the pace of core conversions is accelerating, and we even saw, again, this morning, I guess, with Zions Bank. And so just wondering, what are you seeing from your clients, what are you hearing from them? Is that, in fact, true like have we reached the point now where this acceleration is going to really start to kickstart? And obviously, guidance kind of doesn't build that in necessarily, but I would just be interested in your thoughts given the position you have in the market. John F. Prim: Yes, Dan, we -- look, I would tell you that the crediting side of the business has been pretty frothy for a couple of years and remains at comparable levels to what we have seen. So I wouldn't say that it's picking up over there, but it's a nice environment there. I think it's tough to draw too much of a conclusion from a single quarter. I would tell you that if you could draw a conclusion from a single quarter, this first quarter on the banking side for us would indicate that yes, we think there's maybe a bit of pickup. But I'm a little reluctant to, as I said, take one quarter and project that out for a full year or longer. I think we're definitely seeing some activity, feel like we're very well positioned to compete if decisions do pick up. And there may be some substance to that feeling that it's picking up, but it's a little early to make that call, in my opinion. Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just a last question I have. You guys have delevered the balance sheet very quickly. I'm wondering, as you think about capital redeployment for M&A potentials, do you see things on the horizon that you want to fill into your product portfolio? The technology changes that are taking place from kind of mobile commerce and banking seems to be one area of enormous focus and attention? Or are there partnerships that you feel like you could forge instead of M&A? And I'll jump off. John F. Prim: Yes. Dan, we certainly have -- there's been a fair amount of M&A activity in at least the last year, and we've looked at probably all of the significant deals that took place. The challenge for us is that those acquisitions solve a different problem for somebody else than they do for us. And apparently, that problem was -- that enabled them to pay considerably more money for some of those acquisitions than we felt like they would be worth to our company. We continue to be interested in acquisitions. Again, we're not -- we have a history typically of not overpaying for acquisitions. If we can find something that delivers the right capabilities at a reasonable price, we'll do that. If we're not able to do that, as always, we'll redeploy that cash in the form of dividends and share repurchases. I would say that whether it's investing in additional mobile capabilities or looking at acquisitions in that area, that is certainly something that we are receptive to. But again, nothing concrete that I could talk about today. Operator : The next question is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : I guess first question may be for Kevin. A little bit of help on the Credit Union gross margins, which really picked up both sequentially and year-over-year. And I suspect these are kind of record levels. Could you just give us a little bit more color on what kind of drove that and whether it's sustainable? Kevin D. Williams: Yes, they were record levels, and I'll tell you that the license revenue within Credit Unions was pretty comparable where it was last year. The big driving force was in the support and services, where I believe we had a record for implementation services because there's just an enormous amount of activity going on in the Credit Union space right now. So that, obviously, any time you get higher implementation revenue from the resources, that's going to have a significant impact on margins. But also just the increase in our maintenance data centers and electronic payments, both on those sides are both in the double digits as well in revenue growth. So all of those are going to drive the margin. So are they sustainable at 47%, Glenn? Probably not, but I think they probably will stay in the 45% to 47% range for the year. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then a good segue maybe talking about the competitive environment within the Credit Union market, obviously, with Fiserv having bought Open Solutions earlier this year. Can you just maybe give a kind of an update on what you're seeing competitively? Has it gotten more competitive, stable, less competitive or maybe just some commentary around that? John F. Prim: Glenn, I would say that it's maybe a little more competitive. I think the focus has been on going back to the customers that had signed up for the now discontinued system and convincing them to move to the open offering. So I think there's been a fair amount of activity in that area. Not a lot of new wins that I'm aware of that weren't part of the family, one family or the other. But again, our activity remains quite high over there. We feel good about the -- some of the opportunities that we're currently engaged in. Certainly, I think that it likely will become more competitive once the integration of the 2 companies is done and the story is more clear. But so far, we're still doing quite well in this segment. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Okay, then just the last question for me, and I'll hop off. But the OutLink business, I think, was a 14% growth this quarter. And last quarter, I think it was north of 20%. And before that, you kind of had been caught high single to low double digits. Are we sort of at a new sort of somewhat higher level for the time being or maybe get for Kevin... Kevin D. Williams: Well, if you remember... Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Go ahead. Kevin D. Williams: If you remember, Glenn, last quarter, we talked about some unusual onetime events that happened in the quarter, which really drove the growth in that quarter. This quarter, I think is probably more of a norm. There was some termination fees in there, but it was like $800,000 or more than it was last year, so very little impact on it. I mean, like, it would have impacted down to a 13% growth to 14% growth. So I think it's pretty much a more normalized growth rate that we're seeing this quarter, which is due to a couple of things. I mean, one, 96% of all of our new core bank deals last year went outsourcing. Out of 24 new deals, 23 went outsourcing. On the bank side, close to 50% of the new core deals, out of 35 of them, roughly half of them went outsourcing. Plus, we had 50 existing in-house customers last year who decided to go to outsourcing. So all of those things are continuing to drive the growth more into outsourcing. And to be quite honest, I'm pleased that our in-house maintenance continues to grow even at 2% clip with some of the headwinds that we're seeing from all of our banks and Credit Union customers without having to commit [ph] to outsourcing. Operator : The next question is from Peter Heckmann of Avondale Partners. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : Kevin, could you update us on -- within bill pay? I believe you're doing a data center migration there. Has that been completed? Kevin D. Williams: Peter, I'm trying to remember. I think we still got a little bit of work to do on that -- on the data center migration for bill pay. We've got several data center migrations that we're in the middle of doing right now. Some of those have been completed. And we did a number on the item processing side of our business. Those are complete. We've got several more in the queue. I think we've got a little more work to do on the bill pay data center conversion. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then could you help me remember some of the larger multiyear project that you're doing on the software development side and when we would expect some of those to get into general availability? I'm just trying to handicap a little bit and look out maybe another year in terms of when that capitalization software might even out. Kevin D. Williams: Well, probably the biggest one, Pete, is -- well, it's actually really 2 really big ones. One of those experienced on the bank side, which we are now in -- I think release 3 will be coming out the first part of next year, which will be the last really big one, and these just coming out in our normal annual releases, Pete. So there's no -- it's not like we're building it all up and it's all going to dump out at one time. These are complete rewrites of the user interface for our core and all of our complementary products, and it's going out in piecemeal. So like the first piece was like some tools behind the scene. The second piece was core and our CRM solution and finances and some of our other products. And then this first release was going to entail a whole bunch more of our complementary products since they all look and feel the same, which kind of changes our support methodology. But that is a big one, and there's probably about 1 more year of that one. The other one is kind of the technology upgrade for Episys, which that is a -- that's a 6-year project. I think we're 3 years into it. So there's probably another 3 years or so on that one, and, again, that one's going to come out just in annual releases. So it's not going to be a -- this huge, great, big, new product, but it's allowing us to continue winning new deals. I mean, I will tell you that the technology roadmap that we laid out for Episys is why we were able to get American Airlines Credit Union to convert over us, which is over a $6 billion credit union. If we would not have had that technology roadmap, I'm not sure we would have gotten them. So it -- these are huge projects that are ongoing. I will tell you there's an enormous amount of development going on in everything mobile right now. So I don't know when developments are ever going to stop, Pete, because we just got to continue providing additional new products for all of our customers. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then just, you may have said it and I may have missed it, but were there any insurance recoveries in the quarter from the flooding incident? Kevin D. Williams: No, there we're not. We are in some negotiations with them, so there could potentially be some in this next quarter. I am still negotiating with them, but there is also nothing built into the guidance I've provided either. So if we do get some, it will be a onetime hit. Operator : The next question is from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo. Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I had a couple of questions around payments. I know you gave this out at the -- a little bit of color at the annual analyst day. But I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit of additional update on, as you look at the bill payments portion of electronic payments, sort of how to think about the penetration rates of banks that are currently with you on iPay and their consumer activity. And then I -- and then in -- just in general, how many more banks are -- or sort of you feel are addressable to bring over to iPay that might be using a different third party for bill pay? That was my first question. John F. Prim: Well, Tim, the adoption rates are going to be lower in a typical community financial institution compared to what you're going to have at some of the large institutions like Wells Fargo, Bank of America. Now I think that some of the reason why we're seeing really solid growth rate is in -- is growing user adoption and better utilization of bill payment. We are continuing to add new financial institutions to our bill pay product. I think in the credit union industry, it's probably 95-plus percent of credit unions have a bill payment solution. It's probably low 90 percentile on the banking side. But there is a reasonable amount of churn out there. Remember, that we not only market our bill pay solution to our own customers and to other customers -- other core customers directly, but we have a number of partners, whether they're Internet banking providers or other core system providers, that don't have their own bill payment system that are partnered with us and market our solution to their financial institution customers. So we gain customers, new financial institutions replacing other bill payment solutions via that channel as well. So we think there's still very solid growth opportunities for us in the bill payment market. Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : If I could just stay on that for a second. Within your iPay customer base, is there sort of a reference set of banks you would look at and say, you know what, here are big institutions that have been on the platform the longest or we think have done the best job, and sort of here's where they're at in terms of consumer penetration and usage? And could the vast majority of the remaining portion of our base is at half that, 1/3 of that, just sort of -- just the way to think about like the greenfield that sits within the existing base of FIs versus those that have really figured out the equation and have done tremendously well? John F. Prim: Yes, it's a good question, Tim. I don't know that I can quote you any kind of accurate numbers off the top of my head. But I do think in a ballpark kind of an estimate, if you look at our top performers, to say that the average performer is potentially at half that rate is probably not much of a stretch to believe that, that would be the case. Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then the second question around payments was, you recently added, I think, Laura Kelly to your board, who's got obviously a lot of payment experience. You had brought Tom Wimsett on a while ago. I'm just curious, if the addition of Laura as well as Tom -- does that signify further aspirations around what you think you can do in payments? Or was that more representative of we actually have a big payments business. We should probably have some board members that understand it. So I'm just trying to sort of figure out what those moves were about. John F. Prim: Yes, I think it's a combination of both, Tim. I mean, our payments business, as you know, is over a $400 million-a-year business, and there's obviously a lot of talk around emerging payments and new payment forms. So I think it's a combination of wanting to make sure, given the size and the growth rate and the future potential of that business, that we had folks helping us make the right kinds of decisions about areas of payments that we should be in, shouldn't be in and basically bring us a very deep industry perspective, which Laura Kelly and Tom Wimsett both do. Operator : The next question is from David Togut of Evercore. Michael Landau - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : This is Mike Landau in for David Togut. What was capitalized software in September quarter? And how does that compare to the quarter 1 year ago? And I -- any revision on where you think software capital will land for the fiscal year would be helpful. Kevin D. Williams: Cap software, as I said in my opening comments, for the quarter was $14.1 million compared to $11.7 million last year. So this quarter is -- somewhere in between those 2 is probably a reasonable run rate for the year. It's probably going to end up somewhere around $52 million for the year in total cap software. Operator : And the next question is from Brett Huff of Stephens Inc. Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division : A couple of quick questions. We're talking about M&A and capital deployment, and I'm thinking about the payments question that was just asked. As you guys think about future proofing your business or even thinking about payments as a big opportunity just to even accelerate the growth you had, the -- when you guys bought iPay, folks thought it was expensive. It turned out to be a really good deal. Would you view other payments businesses appropriately given -- I know that you guys are parsimonious with your capital, appropriately so. But how do you think about payments given that even okay payments businesses may be relatively expensive? John F. Prim: Well, I would not disagree with your assessment, for starters. Yes, I think, Brett, we just kind of tend to look at the individual opportunity and what we felt like it was going to do for us near term and long term. Would we pay up for a payments business as we did with iPay that we thought had the right long-term potential? Yes. Would it potentially be at a multiple that would seem somewhat out of bounds for the kind of multiple where we would have -- let's say if we were looking at an acquisition of another core processor, there's no way the multiples that we would pay for any core processor out there would be anywhere close to the multiples that you're likely to get for, frankly, a mediocre payments company or particularly in the mobile arena in any event. So yes, I think we would look at those on a case-by-case basis. If we felt like there was something there that offered us good long-term potential and we had to pay up for it, we would explain that at the time of acquisition as to why we did it and go forward from there. But would not shy away from an acquisition solely for high valuation and particularly in that arena, that arena being mobile. Kevin D. Williams: Yes, and one more comment, Brett. I mean, if you think about when we did iPay, we did pay 16x trailing EBITDA, but their EBITDA was also growing at 43%. So there's a number of factors you have to look at other than just an EBITDA multiple when you're looking at an acquisition of a payment-cycle-related company versus a core, as Jack mentioned. Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division : That's helpful. And then on -- given that HFS has traded hands now and is owned by a Canadian parent, I mean, is there going to be any change to the competitive set you see from them? I mean, did you see them often before, and do you think that'll change going forward? John F. Prim: Brett, I would say that we did not see them that often, and I don't know of any reason why that would change the -- I don't think the ownership of HFS was a problem per se or a problem that's been resolved. So I think we'll see them out there occasionally, but they are not the folks that we are going to be running into on a more frequent basis. Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division : And then last question for me. On the bank headwinds, the bank closure headwinds, the M&A headwinds that existed 2, 3, 4 years ago, I remember you guys had quantified a pretty big drag to organic growth. Have we lapped most of that now? Or are we still getting some of the benefit of that in the very good organic growth that you guys are seeing? John F. Prim: I think we've probably lapped most of that, but again, we had at a fairly sizable customer last quarter, I think it was, that failed, a $3.5 billion bank. Those hurt, but I think, by and large, we're most of the way through that at this point, Brett. Kevin D. Williams: Yes, I think what we're seeing now is more of the resurgence of the typical M&A activity, which is kind of replacing some of the headwinds that we saw from the other. But that's more of a typical 3% or 4% consolidation that we've seen since the '80s. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the next question is from David Koning of Robert W. Baird. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Yes, yes, and just my first question, EFT, it slowed very mildly. I mean, midteens is really good relative to almost anybody else out there. I'm just wondering if you did see at all what Visa and Fiserv and Vantiv have kind of talked about late September, maybe a little into early October just a bit slower volumes and then it sounded like by mid-October, it picked up a little bit again. But I'm just wondering if you saw some of those same trends. Tony L. Wormington: Yes, this is Tony, David. We did see above-average growth in the quarter, but we did see a slight deceleration at the end of the quarter. That really didn't impact the results significantly. The slight deceleration has continued into the early part of the current quarter for the month of October, but we don't expect any significant impact, only a slight deceleration in terms of volumes. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Yes, okay. That sounds like what others said, too. Okay, that makes sense. Secondly, just to review guidance again, I think you talked about this a lot last quarter, if I remember right, but the up to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion is off of a GAAP basis, including the Lyndhurst expenses last year. Kevin D. Williams: Yes, yes. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Yes, okay, okay. That's good. Kevin D. Williams: Because as I said, Dave, there was enough interest reimbursements and some unusual onetime revenue hits that we got last year that it essentially offset the Lyndhurst impact or within a couple of million dollars of it. So for the full fiscal year, the -- if you took all of onetime, put them together, it wasn't a huge impact on our margins. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Right, right, okay. And then it looked like in the press release, you talked about the capitalized software expenses. But there was also a new category I don't remember seeing before, internal use software. Is that something that'll continue kind of around that $3.2 million level that it was last -- this quarter? Kevin D. Williams: It was a little higher this quarter, Dave, and that's something that we have always kind of had out there, but our auditors thought that we should disclose that. So that's kind of a new thing, and it was a little higher this quarter. But it'll be an ongoing disclosure item going forward now. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Did you used to just lump it within the capitalized software? Kevin D. Williams: Yes. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over for closing remarks. Kevin D. Williams: Thank you, Latoya. Again, we want to thank you, all, for joining us today to review our first fiscal 2014 results, which we were very pleased with. And we want to tell you we will continue to do what's best for all of our customers and you, our shareholders. And we thank you for joining our call again. With that, Latoya, would you please provide the replay number? Operator : Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay. And the number is -- one moment. That number is (800) 585-8367 or you may use (855) 859-2056 or (404) 537-3406. And that does conclude our conference for today. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Prim - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Member of Risk & Compliance Committee Tony L. Wormington - President Analysts : Brendan Hardin Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division Michael Landau - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division Operator : Good day, and welcome to today's Jack Henry Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to introduce Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Kevin D. Williams: Thanks, Tyrone. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for the Jack Henry & Associates Second Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. My name is Kevin Williams, CFO. And on the call with me today are Jack Prim, CEO; and Tony Wormington, President. The agenda for the call this morning will be as follows. I'm kicking off. Jack will start with an overview of the quarter from his perspective, and then Tony will provide some operational highlights, and then I'll add some additional color around the press release that was put out after market close yesterday. First, I need to remind you that remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties. And the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. With that, I'm now going to turn the call over to Jack. John F. Prim: Thanks, Kevin. Good morning. We're pleased to announce a record quarter for revenue, operating income and net income. As you recall, a year ago, we incurred significant charges due to Hurricane Sandy-related events and the subsequent recovery that significantly impacted our New Jersey item processing facility. The receipt of funds in the most recent quarter for our related insurance claims clutter the year-to-year comparisons more than they would already have been, but I'm sure Kevin will be able to clear that out. My comments related to the financials will exclude Sandy-related impacts, although we have provided both in our press release. We saw solid organic growth of 9% and maintained strong gross margins even though the high-margin license fees declined in the quarter. The credit union segment in particular had a solid margin performance, as license fees declined 14% from the year-ago quarter, a quarter which had been up 42% compared to its prior year. Solid expense control, with operating expenses increasing 6%, allowed operating margins to increase to 27% from 26% in spite of an increased disaster recovery infrastructure-related spending. Solid sales performances across all 3 brands, with strong core and complementary sales in the banking and credit union segments, and a strong outside-the-core base performance by the ProfitStars team led to an 11% increase in the backlog. Related to the Hurricane Sandy event, as promised a year ago, we have undertaken significant reviews of all company disaster recovery plans and operations and, where appropriate, implemented changes to ensure that this would be a onetime event. We have maintained ongoing communications with our customers and the regulatory agencies to make sure they are fully informed of our progress. I'd like to thank our over 5,000 employees for their continued efforts, on behalf of our customers, that allowed us to deliver these solid financial results. With that, I'll turn it over to Tony for some additional business updates. Tony L. Wormington: Thank you, Jack. Good morning. We remain pleased with the contributions from all components of support and services, which increased 10% in the quarter and year-to-date compared to the prior year. The largest contributor continues to be our electronic payments revenue, which grew 12% for the quarter and 13% year-to-date compared to the prior year periods. Our outsourced data and item processing services increased 11% over the prior year quarter and 12% over the prior year-to-date period. Our in-house annual maintenance fees increased 6% for the quarter and 4% year-to-date over the prior periods. In addition, our onetime implementation revenues were up 8% over the prior year quarter and 9% over the prior year-to-date period. Our electronic payments transaction volumes continued to experience nice growth in the quarter. JHA Payment Processing Solutions transaction volumes for ATM debit and credit processing were up 16% over the prior year quarter. Bill payment transaction volumes increased 7% over the prior year quarter. Financial institution merchants installed and utilizing our Enterprise Payment Solutions increased to approximately 65,000 merchants, representing a 45% increase compared to the prior year quarter. Merchant-related transaction volumes increased 20% over the prior year quarter. In closing, I'd like to thank our customers, our associates and our shareholders for their continued loyalty to JHA. I'll now turn it over to Kevin for a further look at the numbers. Kevin D. Williams: Thanks, Tony. Again, our total organic revenue growth increased by 9% for the quarter compared to the same period last year. To break that down a little further : Our license revenue decreased by 2% for the quarter and represents 4% of our total revenue. Our support and services revenue increased 10%, as Tony highlighted, and represented 91% of our total revenue. To break the support and services down a little bit, as I have in the past : Our implementation services, or those onetime implementation revenue was $22.6 million for the quarter, which was an increase of 8%. Our electronic payments, which we've talked about a lot and continues to grow very nicely, was $110.6 million, it was a 12% increase. OutLink data, item processing was $58.1 million or an 11% increase. And our in-house maintenance of $82.9 million, which is a 6% increase for the quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Our hardware revenue increased 1% for the quarter, or relatively flat, and it still represents 5% of our total revenue. Recurring revenue for the quarter, which is our electronic payments, OutLink data process and in-house maintenance, experienced a growth of 8% for the quarter compared to last year and represented 78% of our total revenue for the quarter. Consolidated gross margins were steady at 44% for the quarter and last year's quarter. License margins increased to 93% this quarter from 91% a year ago, obviously due to less sale of third-party software during the quarter. Our support and services margins were also steady at 42% for both this and last year's quarters. However, margins decreased slightly to 29% from 31% a year ago due to sales mix. In our banking segment, our gross margins remained steady at 44%. And our credit union segment margins were also steady at 45% for the quarter. In our bank segment, license margins increased to 91% from 86% a year ago. Support and service margins for the bank segment were steady at 43%. And hardware margins decreased slightly in the bank segment to 31% from 33%. In our credit union segment, our license margins were steady at 96%. Support and service margins improved slightly to 42% from 41%. And our hardware margins remained level at 25% in the quarter compared to last year. Total operating business decreased 21% for the quarter compared to prior year on a GAAP basis, as Jack highlighted. However, this was impacted a little bit by Superstorm Sandy that occurred in this quarter a year ago. In the prior year, we had a $13.7 million charge in operating income. In this quarter, we had a $2.9 million recovery of interest settlements, which is the last of the insurance claims and settlements. Excluding these onetime events, our operating expenses would have actually increased 6% for the quarter. And as a percentage of total revenue, operating expenses would have been 17% of total revenue, down from 18% a year ago, if you consider these onetime impacts. Our operating margin for the quarter increased to 28% from 21% a year ago, as reported. However, without the onetime impacts created by Superstorm Sandy, it improved 27% from 26% a year ago, which is relatively in line. Our operating income increased 40% for the quarter compared to last year's reported and 10% without the impacts of Sandy. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was at 35.2%, which is up significantly from last year's effective rate of 30.6% this quarter. If you remember, last year, we had the relief of about $2.8 million or a $0.03 EPS impact of previously unrecognized tax benefits from closed IRS audits that occurred in the December quarter of last fiscal year, which obviously we didn't have those same impacts this year. EBITDA increased to $109.9 million for the quarter compared to $83.9 million a year ago, or a 31% increase or actually a 10% increase without the impact of the onetime charges and impacts of Sandy. Depreciation and amortization expense was $26.2 million this quarter, with $13.2 million depreciation and $13.1 million amortization, compared to $24.2 million in depreciation and amortization this quarter last year. Included in the total amortization is amortization of intangibles from acquisitions, which was $5.2 million for the quarter, down from $5.3 million in the same quarter last year. Operating cash flow year-to-date increased to $131.3 million from $119.2 million a year ago. Free cash flow year-to-date, calculated as operating cash flows less CapEx of $21.9 million, which is up a little bit from $19 million a year ago; cap software of $29.1 million compared to $23.8 million year-to-date last year, which the quarter was essentially flat sequentially; and dividends of 31 -- or $34.1 million, up from $19.8 million last year, which obviously this is due to the 74% increase in dividends that we did in 2 increases last spring, free cash flow decreased to $49.0 million compared to $56.6 million last year. And obviously, the base contributors to the decrease in free cash flow is a large increase in dividends that we did last fiscal year. This equates to free cash flow per share $0.57 this quarter compared to $0.66 last year. As Jack mentioned, we continue to have record backlog. Backlog was $122.3 million, which is up 36% from last year. Outsourcing backlog, which is the remaining live current data and item process contracts, was $381.5 million, which is up 5% compared to last year. Total backlog was up 11%. For guidance, we continue to release [ph] the guidance we've previously provided for this year. The second quarter and the first half were pretty much in line with the guidance we provided. Top line revenue should continue in the upper mid to high single-digit revenue growth, with some ongoing leverage to our margins. The results of this continued revenue growth and slight margin leverage should provide operating income growth in the low double digits for the year, which we have seen in the first half of the year. Our effective tax rate should remain at about 35.5% since we cannot predict the reinstatement of the R&E credit. Therefore, EPS should grow pretty much in line with operating income growth in the low double digits for the entire fiscal year. Also, just to remind everyone, in our third fiscal quarter, comps will be as difficult as our second quarter fiscal comps were easy. Last year in our third fiscal quarter, we had 5 quarters of the R&E credit catch-up which was reenacted in that quarter, which we will not have this year. As well, last year, we had insurance reimbursements from lenders in that quarter that we will not have this year as all instructions have now been settled. With these combined was an approximately $0.06 EPS positive impact last year, which means that on an adjusted basis or on an apples-to-apples comparison, the consensus estimate of $0.55 that's currently out there would represent a 17% increase in EPS. So just FYI. That's pretty solid increase on an apples-to-apples comparison. Not saying we should change that outlook but just wanting to highlight that you -- or make sure that you all have that in your models as we look at the third and fourth quarters. With that, that concludes our opening comments. We're now ready to take questions. Tyrone, will you please open the call up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question is from Brendan Hardin of Northcoast Research. Brendan Hardin : I guess I have a question regarding the electronic payments. You provided another strong quarter with that. I guess, based on our backlog and pipeline, I guess, do you see this growth sustainable? Kevin D. Williams: Well, first of all, we don't disclose any of our electronic payments in our backlog. That's one thing that's not in backlog, but I will tell you that our electronics payments backlog is very strong. We continue to have a very strong backlog of implementations out in the future. So I think that we will continue to see very strong growth in electronic payments. I think this quarter is down slightly, which I think that's probably more reflected with the long-term growth, but I think that, that growth is very sustainable for the foreseeable future. Brendan Hardin : And just a quick follow-up. I guess, do you see any acquisition opportunities? Or would you say prices are still a little too high for your preference? John F. Prim: Brendan, it's Jack. We continue to look at the opportunities out there, but I will just tell you that a lot of the recent deals have gone for prices that, while they may have worked in somebody else's model depending on what problem they were solving for them, they didn't come close to working in any of our models. So we'll continue to look at those. And there could be some things we would look at and, in some cases, pay up for if it met a sufficiently strategic need. But some of the more -- some of the larger acquisitions that have taken place out there didn't fit into any of those categories. So certainly have the cash, certainly have the free cash flow to look at something substantial, but there's got to be a reasonable return in our estimation. Operator : The next question is from Peter Heckmann of Avondale Partners. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : Can you just give us an update? We're seeing clearly a flurry of press releases here. It appears that the tenor of the competitive environment in the credit union side has upticked a little bit with some of the consolidation in the space. How do you the feel the credit union landscape looks for you in terms of growth? Where do you think Jack Henry is going to continue to grow? You've had some real significant successes over the last decade in gaining share in the mid- to large-size credit unions. Do you think any of the changes competitively are going to slow that ability to continue to gain share? And if you could comment if pricing is a component of some of the competitions you're seeing in the market today. John F. Prim: Yes, Pete, the -- you're right. I mean the credit union segment has just been very strong for us, and we believe that, that will continue to be the case. We think it'll likely, at some point, get a little bit more competitive with some of the acquisitions that have been done over there. But frankly, we closed 16 new core sales in the quarter. Every 1 of those was a competitive takeaway. We continue to be, with our Episys platform, the platform of choice for the larger credit unions. We have considerably more billion-dollar-plus credit unions installed on that platform than any other platform. In fact, if you combined other vendors' billion-dollar-plus credit unions across their multiple platforms, it would barely be in that same range. So we feel like we've got the right product for that marketplace and that it will continue be strong. We do expect that environment probably will get a little more competitive, but we like our -- like the opportunities that we see out there right now. Pricing has not been, for the most part in the credit union segment, a major issue. I would say, not anymore major than it has been. It's -- there's not a significant change in what we're seeing in the area of pricing competition, but it's been pretty aggressive for quite a period of time on both the banking and the credit union segments of the market. So the core business, of course, a continued strength, as just talked about in the credit union space, we think there are some good opportunities on the banking side as well with increased activity in and among some of the mid-tier banks, the $1 billion to $20 billion kind of the evaluations taking place. And you won't close 16 of those in a quarter, but 1 or 2 here and there can make a nice impact. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : Definitely. Definitely, okay. And then there's been maybe a modest uptick in M&A amongst the bank industry. Do you see -- I guess, in your internal models, do you see bank M&A starting to pick up here over the next year? And if so, how do you anticipate that might affect your business? John F. Prim: I think it's certainly possible that we could see some uptick. We've benefited from a couple of those here recently that -- we think there will likely be some continued activity. Certainly, have been predictions for quite a long time, some of them ridiculous in terms of the level of consolidation that some people expect to see in the marketplace. I think, at the end of the year, you can compare this year to every year for the last 10 or 15 and you'll probably see a net reduction in the number of financial institutions of 3% to 3.5%, and again which is a very consistent number you could see year in, year out for the last decade, if not the last 2 decades. That's where we think it'll be. Now will the size of the banks that are showing an interest in consolidation change? I mean, there -- looked like it was maybe going to be the small banks because compliance costs and other things were going to make it difficult for them to compete. Now there's been a little more activity in the last quarter or 2 from banks in the mid-tier-size range. I think that's going to shift around a -- some. But again, at the end of the year, you can add it all up and I think you're going to see a 3% to 3.5% net reduction, which we've managed to cope with quite nicely for several decades. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : Yes, sure. No, that's fair. And then last question and I'll get back in the queue : Can you just give us an update on the landscape in bill payments, talk a little bit about your current installed base of core institutions? How many of those are now using Bill Pay from you? And what will be the further opportunity to gain wallet share there? John F. Prim: Yes, I don't know if I have the numbers, or Tony may have them, related to the number of installations at my fingertips. But we continue to see strong growth. We certainly see heightened competition, particularly for -- if you'll remember, when iPay was an independent provider, their core agnostics still are, and had a lot of customers that were using competitive core systems. We've seen kind of some stepped-up aggressiveness from one or more core providers who kind of want to bring that business back into the fold, along with their core, but we continue to win some of their customers on a go-forward basis as well. So I would say the competition has probably picked up a little bit for -- primarily for that reason, but we've got a new refreshed version, refreshed user interface version, of our product that we're rolling out to our customers now and we think will continue to help us compete very effectively for new bill payment and competitive replacement bill payment opportunities. Operator : The next question is from Michael Landau of Evercore. Michael Landau - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Sitting in for David Togut. Just a little bit of a follow-up. Would you guys be able to quantify the impact on 2Q Symitar bookings from Fiserv's recent acquisition of Open Solution? John F. Prim: Well, I would tell you that it has -- I don't know that I could quantify it. I would tell you that we have not seen any slowdown. If anything, we've seen activity pick up since that acquisition. Now again, I think that will change. I think that the initial efforts there had been to go back and resecure the business that they had signed to the discontinued platform that they had. So I think that's where their initial efforts have been and focused along with normal integration activities that take place with a significant acquisition. So I think, once they've kind of gotten their arms around that, that they could very well be, that there'll be more competitive attention focused on the marketplace, but I think our perspective is it's pretty clear that there's really only one viable go-forward solution at this point, and that would be the D&A product. There's a lot of credit unions out there on legacy products that are not in that spot. And we think that -- even if they do have some success in some of the new opportunities with the D&A product, that there will be potentially enough other credit unions looking on some of those legacy platforms that aren't getting the level of R&D and enhancements that they like to see. The -- we believe the credit union segment could have a pretty good level of core replacement activity for the foreseeable future. Michael Landau - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : That's great color. Would you be able to quantify the expected growth in your customers' IT budgets for 2014? John F. Prim: Michael, I really couldn't. I mean there's a number of surveys that have been out there by various folks that depending on sample size and validity of the survey, you could be looking at 3% to 5% probably. But I'm just -- that's not my estimates, that's my best recollection of things I've seen. Michael Landau - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Okay, that's fair. And I -- and just lastly, would you be able to quantify your software capitalization expectations for the second half of '14 or into '15? John F. Prim: Well, I don't know if Kevin can. I don't... Kevin D. Williams: Yes, Michael, we're probably on about the run rate now that we're going to be for the next 1.5 years or so, and maybe beyond that because of the different projects that are ongoing. So it kind of ramped up about this time last year, and it's been pretty much on a level pace now for the last 3 or 4 quarters. I mean I don't see that changing significantly in the foreseeable future. Operator : The next question is from Adam Downes [ph] of Baird. Unknown Analyst : You guys turned in, it looks like, some record operating margins this quarter. I was just kind of curious, is that a sustainable level? And how should we look at that going forward? Kevin D. Williams: Well, I would tell you, I mean our -- all of our margins remained fairly level this quarter. I mean our gross margins were about the same at 44%, as they were this time last year. Our support services margins were pretty level, which obviously are going to bounce around a little bit. We were able to squeeze a little bit more to the operating margin line. But if you also remember, there was some insurance reimbursements in the quarter in there that impact that slightly. So yes, our operating margins were up slightly. It was kind of right in line with the guidance we gave at the end of the year that we thought there were some margin improvements that could be had during the year. So it is going to bounce around a little bit, obviously, from quarter to quarter. So it is sustainable, I think, for the year there, but obviously, it could bounce around a little bit next quarter because of all the impacts that I mentioned. Unknown Analyst : And then one quick follow-up. Any termination fees to call out this quarter? Kevin D. Williams: There were some termination fees, and I think they were up -- hold on a little, I have it right at my fingertips. They were up slightly. I think they were up about $1 million this quarter over what they were a year ago but not a significant amount. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next question is from Brett Huff of Stephens. Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division : A couple of quick questions. One -- and I hopped on late. I'm not sure if you've talked about this, but I know you're still in the process of a fairly big user interface refresh across a number of your products. And just wanted to see -- hear how that was going, how the client reception was or if we're rolling it out yet and kind of where we are in the inning rollout there. John F. Prim: Yes. It's going well, Brett. We -- that -- this is an ongoing project. We've -- there's been a significant amount of work. I think our third release related to the -- that user interface refresh is pending here shortly. But again, the -- we are working on user interface and sort of migrating those to a more common look and feel across a large variety of platforms. So 3 to 5 years from now, we'll probably still be talking about this to some extent, although the -- I'd say most of the heaviest lifting is probably, for the most part, done at this point, but there are just a lot of systems and a lot of things going forward. So it's going well, it's been well received. I would say it's primarily available today for the SilverLake core system. And then a number of other complementary modules are in-line as well at this point. And we probably have roughly 25% of the SilverLake base that's actively using it, and more adopting it on a daily basis. Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then bigger picture. You guys' organic growth has been great, outpacing your peers in the market by a factor of 2 or 3. I know some of that's just taking shares. Some of it is cross-sales of some of the products you've acquired in the last couple of years. What is the -- as you guys think beyond the next year or 2, is there another product or group of products that you need to get or would like to get in order to help continue that cross-sell opportunity? And I guess it's -- a larger question is, how long can we sustain this very good high single-digit organic growth? John F. Prim: Well, Brett, I don't know that there's a lot that we need in the way of products. I think, certainly, we're looking at some additional opportunities in the mobile area. We've had good success with our mobile offering. I think we could -- we can grab a larger share of that market. And we're focused on some activities there. But there's not a lot of products that we currently lack in. And some of these products, the credit union core system sales environment, as we talked about, has been very strong and we think can remain very solid. The banking space, with some of the increased mid-tier activity that we're seeing out there, we think has the opportunity to contribute. And then of course, when you win those core deals, there's -- particularly if you're able to also win the payments-related businesses, that adds very significantly. Our payments growth, while, as we mentioned earlier, it was probably at a little less intensive pace this last quarter than it had been previously, but still very solid and well above industry averages that we're seeing out there, and we believe that will continue to be the case. So we think we've got a product set that still has a lot of runway to continue that growth. And could it slow up at some point? I -- possibly, but I still feel like that we'll be able to put up faster organic growth rates than other players in our space for the foreseeable future. Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then one last one. And again, you may have addressed this already, but you guys are going to be building cash here pretty quickly. I know that buybacks or M&A are always on the docket, but can you give us thoughts beyond that, if there are any, or sort of give us -- just go through the use of cash in your view given the build of cash that's coming? Kevin D. Williams: Well, Brett, I mean, obviously, we increased the dividend significantly last year. We typically increase the dividend in our February board meeting, which is coming up later this week. So there -- I'm assuming that it'll probably be a normal small increase like we have in years past, not to the magnitude we did last year. We have not bought any stock back this year because of the regulatory agreement that was filed just before Christmas. Because of that, we had our board and executive blacked out, and when our board and executive are blacked out, I -- do not let the company participate in stock buybacks. So now that, that is filed and behind us, we'll probably back in the market buying back stock, especially with the 11% pullback that we've seen in the last couple of weeks. I would think we will probably be back in the market. We will be taking a look at M&A, but we -- as Jack pointed out, Brett, we're in a really good position. We're growing nicely. We don't have the pressure to have to do something. So if we build up a little cash, we build up a little cash. But we'll continue to be optimistic buying back our stock. We'll continue to look at dividends and potential M&A. Operator : With no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Williams for any closing remarks. Kevin D. Williams: Thanks, Tyrone. Again, we want to thank you for joining us today to review our second quarter fiscal 2014 results. We are very pleased with the results from our ongoing operations and efforts of all of our associates, and we want to thank all of our associates and managers for helping take care of our customers. Our executive managers and all of our associates will continue to focus on what is best for you, our shareholders, and especially all of our customers. With that, I want to thank you again.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Williams. Mr. Williams you may begin. Kevin Williams : Thank you Bridget. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the Jack Henry & Associates, third quarter fiscal 2014 conference call. I\u2019m Kevin Williams, CFO and on the call with me today are Jack Prim, CEO; and Tony Wormington, President. The agenda for the call this morning is as follows : Jack will start with an overview of the quarter. Tony will then provide some operational highlights in the quarter and then we\u2019ll provide some additional comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market closed and then obviously we\u2019ll open it up for some Q-&-A.  First of all, I need to remind you that remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate, due to a number of risks and uncertainties and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements.  For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. With that, I'll now turn it over to Jack. Jack Prim : Thanks Kevin. Good morning and welcome to the call. We are pleased to again announce record revenue, net income and business backlogs for our third fiscal quarter.  Continued strong execution led to organic revenue growth of 7% in the quarter and solid gross and operating margins even as high margin license fees declined 8% from the year ago quarter. Although license fee is a little lower than the year ago quarter, it is worth noting that that quarter had the highest license fee revenue in the previous three fiscal years.  As we have previous indicated, with the strong preference for outsourced processing by new core customers and the continued movement of current in-house customers to outsourcing, the long term trend for license fees will be down. The trade-off here is that we will receive higher total revenue over the contract term and stable, predictable revenue streams. We continue to see strong sales performances across three of our brands and continued market share gains in the credit unit segment, including our 5th billion dollar or larger credit union signed during the fiscal year.  We closed the acquisition of Banno in the quarter and the integration into Jack Henry is going well. We look forward to adding this innovative group to our team and integrating their mobile and web marketing capabilities into our Internet and mobile offerings.  Our biennial employee engagement survey again showed strong results as compared to external company measurements, outperforming these peer companies in ever measured category, and our customer satisfaction ratings remain at their industry leading levels. We believe these two measurements to be closely related. Earlier we announced that Tony Wormington has announced his plan to retire at the end of our current fiscal year. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank Tony for his many contributions to the success of JHA during his 34 year career and wish him all the best in his upcoming retirement.  Dave Faust will assume the roll of President effective July 1 and continue this 15 year career with JHA.  We look forward to seeing many of you at our analyst conference next week, where Tony, Dave and several other key managers will be in attendance and several will go into more detail on various parts of the business. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tony for a closer look at the business. Tony Wormington :   Thanks Jack. We remain very pleased with the contributions from all components of support and services, which increased 8% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date compared to the prior year.  The largest contributor continues to be our electronic payments revenue, which grew 6% for the quarter and 11% year-to-date compared to the prior year period. Our outsourced data and item processing services increased 13% over the prior year quarter and year-to-date period. Our in house software and maintenance fees increased 5% for the quarter and 4% year-to-date over the prior period. In addition, our one time implementation revenues were up 19% over the prior year quarter and 12% over the prior year-to-date period. Our electronic payments transaction volumes continued to experience solid growth in the quarter. The JHA payment processing solutions transaction volumes for ATMs, debt and credit processing were up 12% over the prior year quarter. Bill payment transaction volumes increased 9% over the prior year quarter.  Financial institution merchants installed and utilizing our enterprise payment solution increased to approximately 70,000 merchants, representing a 51% increase compared to the prior year quarter. Merchant related transaction volumes increased 29% over the prior year quarter.  In closing, as I reflect on my upcoming retirement, I would like to thank our customers, our associates and our shareholders for their continued loyalty to Jack Henry and Associates.  I\u2019ll now turn it over to Kevin for a further look at the numbers. Kevin Williams : Thanks Tony. Again our total organic revenue growth was 7% for the quarter with some difficult comps in there, in both payment and license fee as Jack mentioned and our license revenue was down 8% due to those sub-comps. Our support and service revenue increased 8% this quarter over the same quarter a year ago and (inaudible) needs a little more detail. Our implementation revenue of $24.5 million was up 19%; our electronic payments of $109.3 million was up 6%; the total comps I mentioned are deconversion fees that we had in the same quarter a year ago. We are down about $3.5 million this year, which obviously will create some headwinds on that line.  Our outlink data processing was $59 million or it increased 13% and our in-house maintenance was $78.1 million, which increased 5% in the quarter. Hardware revenue increased 2% for the quarter\u2019s third prior year and represents 5% of total revenue. Recurring revenue continued to experience nice growth at little over 7% for the quarter and 79% of total revenue for the quarter.  Gross margins were steady at 41% for the quarter. I mean last year\u2019s quarter license margins were at a level of 92%. Support and service margins improved to 39% from 38% for the quarter, compared to the prior year quarter, driven a lot by the implementation services.  Our hardware margins decreased to 25% from 27% a year ago due to sales mix and our banking segment gross margin remains steady at 40%. Credit union segment margins improved to 44% this quarter compared to 42%, primarily driven by out length in some payments growth.  In the bank segment, license partners remain leveled at 90%. Support and service margins for the bank segment improved to 39% from 38% last year and our hardware margins decreased to 25% from 40% last year again due to sales mix.  In our credit union segment, license margins improved to 96% from 95% a year ago. Support and service margins improved to 40% from 38% and our hardware margins improved to 27% from 24% a year ago. Our total operating expenses increased 9% for the quarter compared to the prior year on a GAAP basis. However in the prior year we had a net impact of about $1.3 million, due primarily to insurance settlements in that quarter related to the super-storm Sandy event. Excluding these one-time events in previous years quarter, our operating expenses would have increased 7% in line with revenue growth for the quarter and the percentage of total revenue would remain leveled at 18% compared to the current year\u2019s quarter. Our operating margins for the quarter increased slightly to 24% from 23% a year ago and our operating income increased nicely 9% for the quarter compared to last year.  The effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.3%, which is up significantly from last years effective tax rate of 29%. Last year we had the impact of the R&D credit, which was signed back into law in this quarter a year ago, which caused five quarters of the credit to be reported in that quarter, which is about a $0.05 EPS positive impact a year ago.  Our EBITDA increased to $98.9 million for the quarter compared to $92 million a year ago or an 8% increase. Depreciation and amortization expense was $27.4 million this quarter with $13.4 million depreciation and $14 million amortization, compared to $26.2 million in depreciation and amortization this quarter a year ago. Included in the total amortization is amortization of intangibles from acquisitions, which remains level of about $5.3 million for the quarter, compared to the same quarter last year.  Our operating cash flow increased to $161.4 million from $152.4 million a year ago. Free cash flow year-to-date calculated as operating cash flow less CapEx was $27.7 million, which was down slightly from $20.4 million a year ago.  Capitalized software of $44.6 million compared to $37.9 million last year, however this quarters cap software was essentially flat each quarter this year and dividends of $52.8 million this quarter compared to $31 million last year, due to the 54% special increase in dividends last spring combined with the more typical 10% increase in February this year caused our dividends to increase slightly.  Free cash flow decreased to $36.3 million compared to $65.3 million last year, which obviously the base contributors decreased and free cash flow was the large increase in dividends. This equates to free cash flow per share of $0.49 this year compared to $0.55 last year.  Just a reminder that our cash flows are significantly skewed to our first and fourth fiscal quarters, due to the annual billing and collection of our in-house maintenance contract revenues. Our cash balance is down significantly due to the purchase of 1.1 million shares during the quarter and the purchase of Banno. In house backlog, which represents contracts of the in-house software and hardware and implementation services is $121.4 million, which was up 21% from last year. Outsourcing backlog, which is for the remaining life of the current data and item process contracts was at $389.3 million and up 8% compared to last year. Total backlog was up 11%. For FY\u201914 guidance, there is no change in guidance that we\u2019ve previously provided for the year. We expect our top line revenue to finish into the high end of the single digits. Our operating income is going to be somewhere in the mid to upper teens. We think we\u2019re going to finish strong for the fiscal year.  Our effective tax rates should remain at about 35% for the full year since we can\u2019t predict reinstatement of the R&D credit and also I just remind everyone that our fourth fiscal quarter revenue comps will be a little bit low as last year we had almost $9 million in one-time deconversion fees in the special credits. But we disclosed last year in the call that hopefully it will not be repeated in this year\u2019s fourth year quarter, because that\u2019s not how we like to make revenues and termination fees. I would also like to wrap up by congratulating Tony on his future retirement and to thank him for all these years of service to our company.  This concludes our opening comments and we\u2019re now ready to take questions. Bridget, will you please open the call lines up for questions. Operator : Sure, no problem. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : Good morning. Kevin, I know the backlog number is a difficult number for you, and it doesn\u2019t really represent the business you have, but based on the backlog, that number that you look at or the numbers you look at and the installations that you know of, how long can you sustain this type of revenue growth, this high single digit or 6% to 8% revenue growth that you\u2019ve been sustaining? Kevin Williams : Well Kartik, I mean I don\u2019t know there\u2019s so much backlog. I mean obviously the backlog is the biggest drivers in there. It is in the in-house piece, there\u2019s implementation services and software and both those are very good guidance. We look at other things. We look at our backlog of installs and what the timeline is of those, but also you know the biggest drivers in our business continues to be outsourcing, which is driven a lot by the in to out and all the new core customers are going to outsourcing and our famous business continues to be very strong.  We had very nice growth in that. If you kind of back out the one-time deconversion fees for last year and those continue to be our good drivers and the backlog is representative that kind of supports that. So I think for the foreseeable future, we\u2019re going to see, we\u2019ll be able to grow our top line revenue in mid to high single digits. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : And then have you seen any change in competition, at least from like Internet banking or bill payment? I think last time you talked about a little bit of competition in the bill payment. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s changed at all and if you are seeing anything on the Internet banking side? Jack Prim : Yes Kartik, this is Jack. Well, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve seen anything change. Its pretty aggressive, particularly for any of the payments related business, not just bill pay, but ATM debit and credit card transaction, routing, etcetera. Our lenders are getting pretty aggressive with some of their bundling tactics and things of that nature, but that\u2019s not a new phenomenon.  So related to Internet banking, I can\u2019t say that we\u2019ve really seen anything different there. For the most part you know the same products are still in the market. They would have been in the market for a lot of possibility with new ownership and a case or two here and there, but essentially the same products. I mean obviously that\u2019s an area of both internet and mobile, where we\u2019re continuing to invest heavily and to keep the products fresh and up to date, but I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve seen anything particularly new in either of those areas. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Jack Prim : Thanks Kartik. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Mr. Williams, I\u2019m not showing any further questions at this time. Please proceed with any further remarks. Oh, I apologize. It looks like we did have one more that\u2019s just skewed up. I have Brett Huff on the line with Stephens. Your line is open. Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.: Thank you. Good morning guys. Jack Prim : Good morning Brett. Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.: Can you guys talk a little bit about the sort of demand that you are seeing across your different product lines. We\u2019ve heard from a couple of core providers in the last couple of weeks and it sounds like there\u2019s more focus on revenue. There is the consistent focus on regulatory and compliance and fraud. Obviously still not an explosion in discretionary spending, but is revenue becoming more of a focus? Are you hearing that from your smaller and medium size banks as well? Jack Prim : Hey Brett, I don\u2019t know that its more of a focus. I mean I think other than in the depths of the financial crisis. I mean for the last year or two there certainly has been a focus on revenue. There\u2019s been a number of studies here lately that indicate that the loan demand is growing particularly in some of the smaller banks and the indication that maybe some of the larger banks are pulling back a little bit in some of the lending areas with more of a focus on liquidity with some of the regulatory constraints that they are facing right now, but I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve heard any of our banks saying, wow your loan demand is really great now, but I think there\u2019s a number of indications that it is improving.  But again, I think that focus on revenue has been there. I think maybe the economy is just now, the economy and or the circumstances I just described are now maybe coming together to make that a little easier to realize, but there\u2019s certainly been a strong focus on revenue and trying to figure out how to replace in some cases revenue that were impacted by the various aspects of the Durbin amendment. But I think that\u2019s been the focus for a while. Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.: Okay, and then my second question is, there is any new entrance into the core space? I mean, I think we\u2019ve seen Zions make a pick outside sort of the big three folks. Are you seeing any changes or tone in conversation? Are the seats at the table with the final decisions on core changing a lot? Are we seeing changes in that as international folks and other not big three core providers try and enter the space? Jack Prim : No, not really Brett. Not new news that some of the international players would like to be here. I think that it\u2019s a lot easier to sell a system for the first time than it is to implement one. So before I attribute too much to that particular implementation that you mentioned, probably I\u2019ll wait and see if it ever got implemented first, but international players have wanted to be here for quite a while. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything new in that, but with only these occasional very odd exception has there been any progress in that area and you know it will happen some day. I think its inevitable, some day it will, but not anything we\u2019re seeing or terribly concerned about today. Kevin Williams : And to your point Brett, I think where your going to see those is in the bigger banks, which is not really where we go access our core solutions anyway, before we see any of them on the low end of the market. Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.: I figured that, just from a bank size point of view. And then I guess one more question is, is the spending on securing your systems continuing a pace? One of the things we\u2019ve been looking at is a lot of the processors, be they are merchant acquirers or core processes, etcetera have been spending on making sure their systems are hardened. I know that you all have invested in some obviously infrastructure, some underground storage and things like that. Should we expect sort of a continuous increase in that kind of spending from you all and cores or has there already been a step function up? Kind of can you give us a sense of how to think about that? Jack Prim : Yes Brett, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be necessarily looking for continued increases. It is at an increased level. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be looking for that level to drop off any. I think that yes, that\u2019s going to be an area where we will all have to continue to remain vigilant. At the same time we\u2019re also continuing to spend on our solutions in that regard in terms of security offerings that we can take to our customers. So I mean I think its defiantly going to continue to be an area of emphasis. I think we certainly are investing more as our customers in the compliance area, audit area, to make sure that we are covering all the bases internally, looking at the systems, testing all the systems, looking for not only security related vulnerabilities, but you know for just risk management standpoint.  So I think there certainly is some elevated spending in those areas and I would expect it to remain roughly at similar levels for probably forever, if not at lease for the foreseeable future. Kevin Williams : Yes, Brett, I would add that if you look at historically our total R&D spend, which is R&D expense plus that software has remained pretty steady at just over 10% of non-hardware revenues. So if our revenue has increased over the years, which we\u2019ve had some really nice growth in revenue, our R&D expense is pacing right along with that and I don\u2019t see that changing. So if the other question you are going to come up, is when you are going to deleverage our R&D, the answer is probably never expect it. That\u2019s what continues to drive sales force. Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Looking forward to seeing you guys next week. Jack Prim : Yes. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019m not showing any questions at this time. Kevin Williams : All right. Thanks Bridget. We want to thank you all for joining us today to review our third quarter fiscal 2014 results. We are pleased with the results from our ongoing operations and the efforts of all our associates to take care of the customers. Our executives, managers and all of our associates continue to focus on what is best for our customers and shareholders.  We hope to see many of you next Monday afternoon at our Annual Analyst Day, which is once again being held at DFW Grand Hyatt. The even will begin at 1 :00 p.m. with presentation from some of our executive team and all of our national sales managers and then we will wrap that even up with reception and many checks there and showoff a few of our hardware products on Monday evening.  With that, I would like to thank you again and Bridget, will you please provide the replay number. Operator : I sure will. The number to call for the replay is going to be 1-800-291-4047.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jack. Jack Prim : Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to the call. We are pleased to again announce record revenue and earnings for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2014. In addition to a strong financial performance, we increased our dividend and stepped up share repurchases during the year to return just under $250 million in cash to our shareholders, including over $130 million in the last quarter. This performance was fairly balanced with our employees and customers as we saw solid gains in satisfaction measures from these major constituents as well. Our sales teams continued their strong performances, and for the fourth consecutive year, all of our brands, JHA Banking, Symitar and ProfitStars finished ahead of their sales targets for the year. Our banking teams saw a balanced performance of core and complementary product sales. Symitar was once again the credit union industry leader in new core system sales, including five new signings during the year of institutions over $1 billion in assets, besting last year\u2019s record of three. ProfitStars again had strong cross sales to its non-core customer base of almost 10,000 institutions with over half of their product sales to non-JHA core customers. Our payments product had strong sales and transaction growth throughout the year and corresponding revenue grew 9% for the year. Revenue growth of 4% in the quarter was lower than normal, primarily due to a tough comparable in the year-ago quarter, particularly in the area of early termination fees. This revenue component tends to be more episodic and less predictable than even license fees, and is not really a category of revenue that you want to see because ultimately it means a customer went away. Adjusting out early termination fees in both periods, we show organic revenue growth of 7% in the quarter and 8% for the full year. We saw solid improvements in operating margins in the quarter and year-to-date even in the absence of these higher-margin early termination fees and with the infrastructure, regulatory and compliance investments we made during the year. Dave Foss transitioned to his new role of President of Jack Henry as Tony Wormington retired after 34 years of service to the company. We are greatly appreciative of Tony\u2019s contribution to the company in a variety of roles over his long career. At the same time, we\u2019re excited to welcome Dave to his new role after his most recent success in driving our ProfitStars business to new levels. As I turn it over to Kevin for a closer look at the financials, I would like to express our appreciation to over 11,000 customers for their continued business and our over 5,500 associates who continue to take care of those customers every day. Kevin, I\u2019ll turn it over to you. Kevin Williams :  Thanks Jack. Our total organic revenue growth increased 4% for the quarter which compared to the same year ago, obviously impacted by the tough comps, as Jack mentioned. As he mentioned, we don\u2019t really like seeing those early termination fees. The Banno acquisition that we closed late in the third quarter contributed slightly to the quarter, but had no bearing on the 4% growth, that\u2019s how insignificant it was. The license revenue increased by 8% for the quarter compared to prior year, and license represented about 4% of our total revenue. Support and services revenue increased 5% this quarter over the same quarter a year ago and represented 91% of total revenue. Obviously, this is the line that had the most impact or actually all the impact of the one-time revenue impacts that we mentioned in the quarter and last year. Support and services revenue actually grew 8% for the quarter and 9% for the year without the impact of those one-times on an apples-to-apples comparison. To break down the support and services a little bit more, our implementation revenue was $26 million for the quarter, up 9%, our electronic payments was $113.9 million, which is up 5%, which again tough comps at just under $2 million in deconversion fee difference this quarter from a year ago, our outlink data processing, which was $61 million for the quarter, increased 3%, but again this line had right at $5 million less deconversion fees this quarter than it did a year ago, and our in-house maintenance at $82.7 million, increased 6% for the quarter. Our hardware revenue decreased 12% for the quarter compared to the prior year and continues to represent approximately 5% of our total revenue. Our recurring revenue experienced growth of approximately 5% for the quarter and 7% for the year compared to the prior year and represents 79% of our total revenue. Consolidated gross margins improved to 43% for the quarter from 42% last year. Again, this was with the one-times in there. We overgrew those and still expanded margins slightly. Our license margins increased to 94% from 91% last year. Support and services margins improved to 41% from 40% for the quarter compared to the prior year and our hardware margins decreased to 23% from 26% due to sales mix. Our banking segment gross margins improved to 42% from 41% a year ago, and our credit union segment margins improved to 45% this quarter compared to 44% last year. Total operating expenses increased 3% for the quarter compared to the prior year, which G&A actually was down a little bit due to the impact of gain on sale of an airplane during the quarter and also some decreased depreciation on the airplanes that we saw in the quarter compared to a year ago. Our operating margin for the quarter increased to 26% and our operating income increased 9% for the quarter compared to last year. If you back out the impact of Banno on the quarter, our organic revenue income actually grew 11%, compared to last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.4%, which is up significantly from last year\u2019s effective rate of 32.2%, and our income before income taxes increased 13%, but our net income only increased 6% because of the significant increase in income taxes, primarily due to the impact of the R&E credit a year ago.  EPS of $0.60 was up 9% over last year, impacted by both stock buybacks and the Banno acquisition, which the Banno acquisition was a $0.01 EPS dilution effect on us this quarter. Our EBITDA increased to $108.1 million for the quarter, compared to $98.7 million a year ago or approximate 10% increase. Within this, depreciation and amortization expense of $28.3 million for the quarter with $13.4 million depreciation and $14.9 million amortization, compared to $25.7 million last year. Included in total amortization is the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions, which is up slightly to $5.5 million, compared to $5.3 million this quarter last year. The increase is obviously due to the Banno acquisition. Our operating cash flow year-to-date increased to $341.7 million from $309.2 million a year ago. Free cash flow year-to-date, calculated as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, of $49.5 million, which this $49.5 million actually includes both CapEx of $33.2 million and the internal use developed software of $16.3 million which is where this has been going in previous years, but we broke it out on the cash statement this year. It has not been included in cap software in previous quarters. Compared to $46.34 million last year, our cap software of $62.3 million this year compares to $51.3 million last year, again continues to be up due to the significant projects we have going on and just having to satisfy larger customers. Our dividend of $31.3 million was up significantly from $48.2 million last year, representing a 48% increase, plus the proceeds of sale of assets within this calculation of $7.8 million this year compared to $0.5 million last year. So, free cash flow was basically at $166.4 million compared to $162.7 million, impacted significantly by the increase in dividends. This equates to free cash flow per share of $1.95 compared to $1.89 last year, and our cash balance is down significantly due to the purchase of 1.9 million treasury shares during the quarter and a little over 3 million shares during the year actually in the second half. Our in-house backlog, which represents contracts in hand for software, hardware and implementation services yet to be delivered is at $118.7 million, which is up 12% last year. Outsourcing backlog, which is for the remaining life of our current data and item process contracts, was essentially flat with last year, and our total backlog was up 3%. As we\u2019ve talked about over the last year or so, and on some of these earnings calls, this is the last time we plan to disclose our outsourcing backlog. Due to the confusing nature of this number with all the renewals, the migrations of our customers to in-house outsourcing, the average length of the contract changing so dramatically, it makes it very meaningless for modeling. So we are not going to disclose our outsourcing backlog in the future. We will continue to disclose our in-house backlog. And again, there has never been anything in our backlog for our electronic payments business which is about 37% of our revenue and we do not intend to start reporting that backlog either. As far as FY15 guidance, we kind of hinted at that on the last earnings call, we\u2019ll kind of confirm that now. Our top line revenue we project for FY15 will continue to be in the mid-to-high single-digit growth range, similar to what we saw in FY14. As we\u2019ve been discussing for the last six months or so, we do not anticipate much in the way of margin expansion in FY15 for either gross or operating margins because of the significant investments and increase in personnel that we\u2019ve done in the last year and continue to do to make sure that we are solid for our customers and put our disaster avoidance plan completely in play, but we do not expect any significant drop in margins either. We think we\u2019ll maintain our margins for next fiscal year comparatively to FY14. The effective tax rate should remain at about 35.5%. Obviously, this could be impacted if the R&E credit is put back in place or if there is other legislation passed, but we cannot anticipate those changes until they actually become law. So in your models, please go and use 35.5% as the effective tax rate. As far as the current consistent EPS estimates out there recorded by FY15, it appears to be mostly in line, however, I would probably say that we are a little more back-end loaded, then it looks like the consensus estimates are out there on a quarterly basis. It appears like the first quarter is probably a little high, so I would probably need to pull that in a couple of pennies to get more in line with our current forecast and budgets. However, during the year there should be some leverage to our EPS from our stock buyback that we bought back in FY14, and again we anticipate to continue to be in the market buying back our stock in FY15, maybe not at the same levels that we did in the fourth quarter, but we will continue to be in the market. We currently have 5.2 million shares remaining under authorization to buyback with no timing or pricing constraints. This concludes our opening comments. With that, we are now ready to take questions. Bridget, will you please open the call line for questions. Operator :  Thank you, Mr. Williams. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research :  Kevin, you talked about margin expansion FY15 being about -- margins being about similar in FY15 to FY14, and you talked about some of the investments you are going to make. Do you think these are one-time investments and that after that you would go back to the type of margin expansion you have had in the past or is there some change in the business that you need to continue to make investments going forward? Kevin Williams : We made some significant investments, Kartik, that\u2019s a good question, and obviously we have changed our business a little bit. I mean we are going to continue to make investments because with being in what we consider now disaster avoidance versus disaster recovery, everything is replicated. So when we buy a new server in production, we buy the exact same server in our backup sites or in the second production site theoretically, but we\u2019ve made investments, we\u2019ve beefed up our internal audit compliance team, which hopefully that\u2019s kind of leveled off. So there is some continued investment that I think we have to make, but I think we\u2019ll grow over that. I think Jack and I have been pretty consistent for the last six to nine months, kind of predicting this is going to happen and we don\u2019t think there is going to be any margin degradation, but we think it\u2019s going to be pretty solid for the next year and it\u2019s probably going to take us a year to grow over that and then probably FY16, we get back to some margin expansion. There will be some -- obviously, every quarter there is going to be some margin fluctuations, but I think we are going to be pretty solid for the next year. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : And then, Kevin, I think there has been a lot of talk about mobile banking and the usage of that. Can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s happening from a pricing standpoint? So I guess what I am trying to get to is we hear a lot about subscriber growth being very high, but what does that translate in terms of revenue growth? Jack Prim : Kartik, this is Jack. There are various pricing models out there and there certainly is some more price competition than what there was a couple of years ago in the area of mobile. In some cases, there are per user charges for certain mobile elements. There are certain cases there could be a monthly charge which entitles you to some number of users. So tracking the growth and number of subscribers directly to a prediction of what that should do to revenue is difficult, if not, impossible to do. We are seeing very strong growth in adoption. We are seeing the revenue grow nicely. Again, I think that the pricing on that per user or whatever methodology is going to come under some pressure, I think, industry-wide, but still a lot of good growth capability left. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Peter Heckmann with Avondale Partners. Your line is open. Peter Heckmann - Avondale Partners : Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics on the credit union side? I know Symitar continues to have a strong record of winning in large credit unions. Has there been any change in dynamics in the under $1 billion market since Fiserv's acquisition of Open Solutions, as well as with some of the smaller players? Jack Prim : Pete, I wouldn\u2019t say that there has been a significant change. We had said from the beginning that we suspect that their initial efforts would be focused at solidifying some of the replacements of some of the orders for the previous systems they had had out, I think that was the case. I think they are largely past reselling those customers and so we are seeing them probably a little more competitively, but I don\u2019t think there has been a significant change. We had 44 new core system wins, all of those competitive replacements last fiscal year, and as I mentioned, five of them were over $1 billion in assets, 39 of them were not. So those represented wins pretty much across the board. There were maybe a couple of wins in the very small credit unions under $50 million in assets, but the majority of those wins were going to be in that $75 million to $250 million, $500 million asset range and we continue to do very well there. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from David Togut with Evercore. Your line is open. David Togut - Evercore Partners : The electronic payments revenue growth at 5% continues to decelerate. I believe it peaked at about 18% four or five quarters ago. Can you just walk us through the underlying drivers of that 5%, why growth has come down so substantially over the last four to five quarters? Jack Prim : David, I think a large contributing factor to that was the early termination fees that Kevin mentioned earlier. We\u2019re continuing to see very good transaction volume growth ahead of industry averages. There continue to be certainly some pricing pressures in some aspects of the payments business that would be part of the impact there. But I think a large part of the impact in this quarter was the early termination fees or the lack of early termination fees in this quarter compared to the year ago quarter. Kevin Williams : Yes. And the other thing, David, the piece that you are talking about four or five quarters ago, we addressed that at that point. That\u2019s when we did a very significant conversion of a large number of credit unions from Accurso and we anniversaried that, I believe, in the December quarter. So we can\u2019t really look at that peak, the five quarters ago as being where we could go. I think we\u2019re probably more in line in the very high low double-digit growth rate now as far as our electronic payments growth going forward. David Togut - Evercore Partners : So what was the growth rate of electronic payments if you adjust for the year-ago term fees, at least in the June quarter? Kevin Williams : If I adjust the term fees, it would be about just under 8% for the quarter and a little over 10% for the year. David Togut - Evercore Partners : And then on cap software, you indicated, Kevin, that it was up 21% year-over-year for FY14 as a whole. What is your outlook for cap software for FY15? Kevin Williams : Our cap software for FY15 is going to be about the same as FY14, Dave. As we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve got some major projects going on. Mark Forbis and some others talked about that at the Analyst Day at May, some of the projects we\u2019ve got going on. These are multi-year projects that are going to impact our core solutions and some of our payment solutions for years to come and they are coming in phases. I would say one of the things that I look at, our Board looks at, is the percentage of our cap software that\u2019s actually in production which has not changed dramatically over the last few years. So we are capitalizing a lot of our software because it\u2019s going to give us long-term benefits, but it\u2019s going into production phases on a quarterly and annual basis. So it\u2019s just going to continue probably about the level of what this year is based on our initial pass of our budget. David Togut - Evercore Partners : Understood. And can you quantify what the early termination fees were this quarter? How much? Kevin Williams : Yes. They were, in total, just over $2 million compared to just under $9 million in the quarter a year ago. David Togut - Evercore Partners : And just a quick final question from me, Kevin, what was the end-of-period share count? Kevin Williams : It was about just under 84 million. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Brett Huff with Stephens Incorporated. Your line is open. James Rutherford - Stephens Incorporated :  Good morning. This is James Rutherford in for Brett. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple questions from me. The first on growth, could you give some commentary on what are the factors that might lead to a mid-single digit growth versus high-single digit in your guidance range? And then more in the long term how you view yourselves growing and how you will continue to grow industry-leading organic growth versus peers and what will be the driver there? Is it kind of new products or is it sales execution, et cetera? Jack Prim : James, several things in terms of what could influence mid versus high single digits. License fee that you might realize in the year can certainly make a difference with 80% recurring revenue. It pretty well takes something like license fees to be able to make an impact almost in the fiscal year, let alone in any particular quarter, and again those tend to be somewhat episodic in nature. Early termination fees are similarly unpredictable and not, as we talked about earlier, usually something that we -- certainly not something we seek or have a particular forecast for because we just don\u2019t know what that\u2019s going to be. I think those are some of the impacts. I think the longer term, the ability to continue to grow at above average industry rates, first of all, we still project mid-to-high single-digit organic growth for the, I would say, the foreseeable future, which is a relatively near-term, but I think some of the things that give us comfort in that area is the continued growth in both our payments and our outsourcing business. Keep in mind that we\u2019re a little unique in that we started out as a company offering in-house processing only, and at a relatively new, 15 years or more, but relatively new in this industry in the outsourcing business. So the majority of our customers are still in-house and we are continuing to see that migration, that interest level in moving from in-house to outsourcing. So we have a larger base of customers that can potentially make that transition over time and as we\u2019ve talked about at analyst conference and in our investor conference, when we see a customer makes that transition, typically our revenue doubles, at a minimum doubles in the first year after they transition from in-house to outsource, and actually tends to increase even further from there in subsequent years. So I think there is probably more of an opportunity there for us than some of the other folks, and I think those are some of the major components that we would see that give us confidence in those forecasts. James Rutherford - Stephens Incorporated : And do you guys break out how much of your revs are from in-house versus outsourced? Kevin Williams : Not really. If you look at our P&L, we break down license fees, which is obviously all basically in-house. Obviously, there are some other things in there, but we do show outsourcing revenue - we breakdown outsourcing within our support and services line, which is all data and item processing. But to say an in-house customer versus outsourced customer, the lines get blurred really fast there, because they\u2019ve got all of our payments businesses, they\u2019ve got some implementation fees, even some of our outsourcing customer may actually have an in-house product, and so they may also have some hardware, so to try to split the difference between a true in-house revenue stream and an outsourced revenue stream is almost impossible. James Rutherford - Stephens Incorporated : And then the last question from me is on capital deployment. Could you just kind of rank your priorities here and then where your minds are on M&A going forward in terms of the kinds or the sizes of deals you might be considering? Kevin Williams : Obviously, we\u2019d love to find the right M&A opportunities, but right now, the valuations that are expected out there seem to be a little high. We will continue to focus on returning capital to our shareholders through continued dividend increases and systematic buybacks of our stock. I mean jack, do you want to comment on what we\u2019re looking at in M&A? Jack Prim : James, I would say we are more interested in finding the products that make sense more so than focusing on acquisition of a particular size. Obviously, we like something that moves the needle and is going to be worth the effort, but anything from ideally probably in the $20 million to potentially $100 million or more in revenue would certainly be something that we would look at, which is not to say, we wouldn\u2019t look at something with $2 million or $5 million if it was an acquisition of technology or something that we felt like really was going to offer good growth when incorporated into our product offerings. But again I think Kevin\u2019s point is that we do not tend to overpay for acquisitions. We think that some of the prices that properties are going for out there now are difficult to justify from a financial standpoint, frankly, in our case, from a strategic standpoint, as well. So, again, as Kevin mention, in terms of uses of capital, dividends and share repurchases based on what we see right now are likely to be more of a focus area for us than M&A per se. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is open. Dave Koning - Robert W. Baird:  Hey, guys another nice year. Jack Prim : Thanks, Dave, Dave Koning - Robert W. Baird: And I guess, first of all, just on the outsourcing business, if we looked the last three years now, you went from 5% growth in fiscal \u201812 and then 12% in fiscal \u201813 and then 10% this year. But, if we exclude the big term fees from fiscal \u201813, it actually looks like you have had a nice accelerating pattern from \u201812 to \u201814. And I am just wondering, it seems like that momentum likely continues. There is a big group of banks and credit unions that can still outsource. Is that right? Is there any reason to not expect kind of that double-digit growth to continue in outsourcing? Jack Prim : No. You\u2019re right on the path, Dave. Obviously, we\u2019ve seen this trend starting back in 2008 of our existing in-house customers moving to outsourcing. That\u2019s been pretty steady the last three are four years at 40, 45 FIs been wanting to do that, but we\u2019ve been seeing is some of the larger banks that are willing to do that and we\u2019ve had several banks the last year over $1 billion. I think we\u2019ll continue to see that trend. And then, obviously the majority of our new customers on the bank side at least ago outsourcing. Last year I think all but one went outsourcing. On the credit union side, we continue to see a migration of smaller or a lower pace than we do on the bank side from in to out, but it still continues to be very strong, and about 60% of our new core customer wins on the outsourcing are on the credit union cycle outsourcing. So I think you\u2019re going to continue to see that nice strong growth in that line of revenue going forward. Dave Koning - Robert W. Baird: And then, similarly, I guess the implementation revenues, the last two years were the second and third strongest growth of the last 10 years. So I mean that has been really good as well and is that just correlated so that if outsourcing is really strong, it just means there's a lot of implementation work as well that keeps coming? Jack Prim : Not really. That\u2019s more driven, Dave, by some of the large in-house implementation we go on the ProfitStars side. We\u2019ve had some large Alogent deals that have been going on that have driven some nice implementation revenue. And then, obviously you got to remember there is a significant amount of merged revenue where our customers are buying other banks, which that drives a lot of that implementation revenues. So those are probably the biggest drivers that has caused that increase in the last couple of years, and I don\u2019t see those slowing. Dave Koning - Robert W. Baird: I guess secondly the buyback you talked about, when you talked about EPS being around kind of in line with what the Street estimates are for fiscal \u201815, does that include some estimates of buyback or would any buybacks be incremental? Jack Prim : That would really depend on the timing of the buybacks, Dave, because obviously you go by the average shares, so obviously we will be kind of precluded from buying any shares this quarter until after we announced -- until basically next week. So it kind of limits the time we can bid in this quarter, so kind of reduce the impact. So the guidance I\u2019m giving doesn\u2019t get a whole lot of impacts of buying additional share back this year, but if you\u2019re going to build it into your models, you might want to impact of 1 million or so shares weighted average over the year. Dave Koning - Robert W. Baird: And then I guess just lastly, you will probably tell me I am too deep in the weeds on this, but accounts receivable actually down year-over-year in Q4. Did you steal a little bit of free cash flow into fiscal \u201814, which was a really, really strong cash flow yield and kind of steal just a little bit from \u201815 or should we still think free cash flow above earnings in \u201815? Kevin Williams : Obviously, we still got a lot of cash coming in in the September quarter. I will tell you that our collections on our annual maintenance was about 3% ahead this year where it was last year June 30. So I don\u2019t know - you can say we stole some, but I think there was a little shift in timing by about 3% of that $2 million or $220 million that we billed June 1. We were about 3% ahead of collections on those at June 30. Operator : Thank you. And looks like we do have a follow-up from Peter Heckmann with Avondale Partners. Your line is open. Peter Heckmann - Avondale Partners : Hey, Kevin, could you talk about any major new releases of modules or functionality that you are currently working on, have been capitalizing that may go into production and how that might impact R&D as a percent of -- R&D, as well as overall margins for this year and next? Jack Prim : Pete, this is Jack. The nature of some of these projects is that they are large projects delivered incrementally. So whether it\u2019s some of the technology, infrastructure rework that we\u2019re doing on both the banking and credit union platforms, those are going to be rolled out in phases on a multi-year kind of a schedule. So, in terms of those components rolling into production and being something that\u2019s going to be meaningful to what you get see on the financial statements, I don\u2019t know that there really is anything that we could speak to there and I\u2019m sorry I forgot the second half of your question, Pete. Peter Heckmann - Avondale Partners : Just trying to think about how, as the amortization of previously capitalized software begins, whether we see any particular step-up at any point in time or if it would be just phased in over time? Kevin Williams : We\u2019ve been rolling these out for the last couple of years as we continued to see an increase in cap software. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that. That was to my earlier comments about we\u2019re probably not going to see much margin improvement over the next 12 months and that\u2019s primarily because of those investments and the rollout of some of these [indiscernible]. But to that point, our EBITDA margins are at 35% for the fiscal year compared to 32% a year ago and actually 32% in the last three years. So that right there tells you that we\u2019ve already seen some of that increase in G&A as it\u2019s impacting our overall P&L, but it\u2019s a positive impact to our EBITDA, which I know you guys love to follow EBITDA. Peter Heckmann - Avondale Partners : Sure enough. But just to confirm, we are not looking at some major overhaul or rewrite something on the lines of a new open architecture or real-time processing type platform. This is really just more incremental development? Jack Prim : Well, certain of those components, Pete, are definitely parts of some of the rework that we\u2019re doing. Last December, I believe it was, we completed a complete redevelopment of the Cruise, our low-end credit union system and moved it to really pretty much a completely new architecture. And basically the kinds of things we\u2019re talking about here are going to be different depending on which product that you\u2019re looking at, but there definitely are some of those types of components changing the database structure, changing in some cases to some real-time functionality. But again - so, for example, on a real-time functionality, last year on the banking and the SilverLake application, we released some initial real-time capabilities. We are enabling some additional real-time capabilities that will be rolled out this year. So yes, some of those things you mentioned are components of what we\u2019re doing, but there is no big bang that all of a sudden on a certain day, there is a completely redeveloped application available for implementation, it\u2019s, as I said, on incremental release process spanning multiple years. Kevin Williams : Yeah, Pete, we sort of talked about these three years ago and they continue to grow and they are big projects, but there has been annual releases rolled out each year for the last three years and that\u2019s the way it will continue. So there is one big bank that you are going to see a quarter and say, holy crap, depreciation just jumped up 40%, it\u2019s not going to be that way. Operator : Thank you. And I\u2019m not showing any further questions. Please proceed with any closing remarks. Jack Prim : Thank you, Bridget. Again, we want to thank you for joining us today to review our fourth quarter and year-end fiscal 2014 results. We are pleased with the results from our ongoing operations and the efforts of all of our associates to take care of our customers. Our executive managers and all of our associates will continue to focus on what is best for our customers and you, our shareholders. With that, I want to thank you again and Bridget, would you please provide the replay number? Operator : Yes, sir, I can. If you want to hear the replay which will be available in two hours is 855-869-2060. Now, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program. Thank you all for listening. You may all disconnect.

Baird Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Jack Henry & Associates\u2019 First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Kevin Williams, CFO of Jack Henry & Associates. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Kevin Williams : Thank you, Bridget. Good morning, and again, thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry & Associates\u2019 first quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. I am Kevin Williams, CFO, and on the call with me today is Jack Prim, our CEO. The agenda for the call this morning is, Jack will start with his thoughts on the performance of the quarter. Then I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we\u2019ve put out yesterday after market close, and then we will open the lines up for Q&A. I need to remind you that remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate, due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday\u2019s press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled, Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jack. Jack Prim : Thanks Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2015. We are pleased to again be able to report a strong performance for the quarter, solid gains in every revenue component with the exception of hardware, allows us to show organic revenue growth of just under 8% in the quarter. Outsourcing, payments and implementations, all showed strong growth, and license fees were up nicely with contributions from new core and add-on complementary product sales. The decline in hardware revenue is a reflection of the continued interest in hosted delivery of our products, resulting in fewer sales of new core processing units, and reduced upgrades to existing processors, as in-house customers transitioned to outsourcing. We held our Annual Banking and Credit Union user conferences in recent weeks, and observed continued improvement in their outlook on the business environment, citing improved loan demand even in areas like the Southeastern United States, which were hit particularly hard in the recent recession. It was a good start for the year. We look forward to continue the progress. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin for a closer look at the numbers. Kevin Williams : Thank you, Jack. Our support and service line of revenue continues to drive our total revenue growth, as it increased to $292.5 million, which is an 8% increase over the same quarter a year ago. And our support and services now represented about 92% of our total revenue in the current quarter. To breakdown the support and services a little bit further into the four primary components : the implementation revenue was $26.3 million this quarter, which increased 16%; our electronic payments was $119.4 million, which is a 9% increase over a year ago; our outlink data processing was $63.1 million or an increase of 13%; and our in-house maintenance at $83.7 million was an increase of 3% for the quarter. Our recurring revenue, which is made up obviously the electronic payment, outlink and our in-house payments, expressed a growth of little over 7% for the quarter compared to the prior year, and still represents 79% of our total revenue for the quarter. Our consolidated gross margins decreased slightly to 42% for the quarter from 44% in last year\u2019s quarter. License margins increased to 90% from 88% last year, support service margins decreased to levels of 42% from 43% year ago due to sales mix, and our banking segments \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, hardware is 26% up from 24% a year ago. Our banking segment gross margins were steady at 42% and our credit union segment margins decreased to 46% compared to 47% a year ago. In the bank segment, license margins increased to 90% from 84% a year ago due to fewer third-party solutions sold in the quarter. Our support and service margins for the bank segment decreased slightly to 41% from 42%, and our hardware margins increased to 26% from 23% in our bank segment. In our credit union segment, license margins were 90% compared to 93% a year ago. Support and service margins were steady at 44%, and hardware margins were also leveled at 26% for both periods. Our total operating expenses increased 8% for the quarter compared to prior year. Our operating margin remained level at 26% compared to the last year and our operating income increased 7% for the quarter compared to last year. Organic operating income increased about 8% compared to last year, as the acquisition that we did last March continues to be slightly diluted. The effective tax rate for the quarter was at 36% compared to 35.5% last year, obviously because the R&E credit has not been renewed. Our net income increased 6% for the quarter compared to last year, and our EPS of 64% was up 10% over last year was positively impacted by the stock buybacks. Our EBITDA increased to $112.1 million for the quarter, compared to $103.3 million a year ago or approximately 9% increase in the EBITDA. Depreciation and amortization expense at $29.5 million this quarter was $13.6 million depreciation and $15.8 million in amortization, compared to $25.9 million in D&A this quarter last year. Included in the total amortization is amortization of intangibles from acquisitions, which is up slightly to $5.4 million, compared to $5.2 million this quarter a year ago. Our free cash flow year-to-date was down compared to last year due to our operating cash flow being down slightly, primarily due to net changes in the working capital items. The CapEx increased significantly this quarter due to the timing of some infrastructure upgrades and expansions, especially in the area of our high capacity storage, which had possession at the third plan in our plan upgrade cycle, which the fourth and final one will be about a year from now. The internally used developed software was up slightly compared to last year, and our cap software increased again, as we continue to focus on some significant product development. And then obviously our dividends increased once again, which all of these related dollar amounts were disposed in the press release yesterday. So net of all those adjustments are result of free cash flow of $32.2 million compared to $58 million last year for this quarter. Our cash balance is down significantly for the quarter or for the year ago and even from fiscal year end, due to the purchase of little over additional million shares this quarter on top of 3 million shares that we bought last year. For our ongoing guidance, there is no change in our guidance. We continue to expect top line revenue in the mid-to-high single digits. As we\u2019ve discussed on previous calls, we don\u2019t anticipate much in the way of margin expansion this year for either gross margins or operating margins, due to the significant investments in increased personnel that we\u2019ve made in the last 12 months. We do obviously anticipate the usual quarterly fluctuations due to sales mix going forward, but no significant change in the margins. There should be some leverage to our EPS from our shares bought back. We currently have 4.1 million shares remaining under authorization buyback with no timing or price constrains. That concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions. Bridget, will you please open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from David Togut with Evercore. Your line is open. David Togut \u2013 Evercore ISI : Thank you. Good morning, Kevin and Jack. Kevin Williams : Good morning. David Togut \u2013 Evercore ISI : It\u2019s actually now Evercore ISI. We just completed our combination. Just a couple of quick questions. First, if you could dig into the key drivers of electronic payments revenue growth. It was 9% in the quarter. That\u2019s down from 15% a year ago, but up from 5% in the June quarter. Could you just walk us through the puts and takes behind the 9%, and what you see going forward? Kevin Williams : Yes. David, it was pretty solid performance on each of those components. I think bill payment transaction growth was up about 18%. The PassPort debit and credit transaction processing was up a little over 8%. I don\u2019t have the remote deposit capture numbers handy, but they were up solidly as well in the quarter. So it was a pretty good performance across the board on various payment products. David Togut \u2013 Evercore ISI : And is this high-single-digit growth rate in electronic payment sustainable? Kevin Williams : Yes. We think so, David. David Togut \u2013 Evercore ISI : Got it. And just moving on to the large credit union business, Fiserv has been highlighting its success with DNA, the Open Solutions acquisition. What have you seen with Symitar head-to-head against DNA over the last few months, and what do you see going forward? Jack Prim : Well, Symitar has continued to quite well, David. We signed in the quarter two credit unions that were over a $1 billion in assets. I think we had a total of seven new core footprints in the credit union. All of those were competitive replacements. We don\u2019t even put out a press release when we sell something to an existing credit union or bank that moves from in-house to outsourcing or buys a new license for whatever. So all of our wins are competitive takeaways. David Togut \u2013 Evercore ISI : Got it. And then just shifting to software capital, it looks like it was up about 28% in the quarter. I thought Kevin you were calling that out to be flat for FY15. Did something change? Kevin Williams : Well, I would say, David, we just continue to focus on some of these major projects. I think we have actually stepped up the pace on some of the projects to get them roll last quarter than later. So it\u2019s just a matter of timing of time to get these products developed and out the door. David Togut \u2013 Evercore ISI : What are the biggest products behind the software cap number? Jack Prim : Dave it\u2019s going to be any number of products that have significant expenditures on. Some of the couple or larger projects are the Emphasis [ph] product line credit union side, SilverLake enhancement they were doing on the banking side. You got compliance or related development across the board on all of those products, but even your complementary products whether its development on the mobile side, internet banking side, whether it\u2019s just an architecture or refresh of some product. When you\u2019ve been in business for 37 years and you got over 100 products, there is something that\u2019s always in need of some development attention in addition to whatever new product development effort. So it\u2019s hard to pinpoint any one or two particular items. David Togut \u2013 Evercore ISI : Great. And just quick final housekeeping question. What were deconversion fees in the quarter, and then the September 30 share count? Kevin Williams : Deconversion fees were right at $5 million, compared to a little over $3 million a year ago. So about a half [ph] percent of our total revenue growth came from a slight increase in deconversion fees. So even without those, we were still over 70% organic growth. The share count at September 30, roughly $82.5 million, Dave. David Togut \u2013 Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is open. Dave Koning \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Yes. Hi guys, great job. Jack Prim : Thanks David. Dave Koning \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Yes. And so, I guess first of all, you\u2019ve talked the last couple of quarters about kind of starting the new hosting product across your clients. I\u2019m just wondering \u2013 I know that\u2019s going to take a lot to ramp, but was there any benefit yet from that in the quarter? Jack Prim : No financial impact in the quarter, Dave. It has been well received, and we\u2019ve had our banking user conference about two weeks ago, a lot of discussion around it, there\u2019s good bit of interest. So we\u2019re still pretty optimistic that we\u2019ll see some solid uptake there, but again, that is something that\u2019s going to build slowly. I wouldn\u2019t predict anything noteworthy if even noticeable in this fiscal year, but I think it\u2019s something that will gain momentum and become more of a factor in the near future. Dave Koning \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Okay, great. Secondly, just I don\u2019t know if your banks are quite as focused as some of the bigger banks on the Apple Pay roll-out, but just wondering your context, obviously it just seems like there is no reason for the banks to want to really push that given \u2013 it seems they are giving up pretty big chunk of their economics of interchange. I\u2019m just wondering, have you talked to banks about it in kind of what the context is? Jack Prim : Yes, it\u2019s kind of across the board, Dave. There are some that just aren\u2019t quite sure yet what to make of it or whether or not they should be interested. There are others that are very interested in it, even if it means given up some interchange, they feel like it\u2019s something that they need to be in a position to offer to meet their customer demand. So we\u2019re working very closely with those banks and credit unions and with Apple for those that do want to be first in line or as soon as they can get in line and blast appropriately by Apple, going through all their processes but \u2013 so we\u2019re working with those that are interested. Again I think in some cases, it\u2019s still trying to understand exactly what the announcement means and then others. You got your early adopters that are going to want to be in their early, just in case, it does turn out to be something of significance. Dave Koning \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Okay, great. And then just finally, you\u2019ve bought back more shares in the last couple of quarters than normal. Is the strategy to kind of keep the balance sheet kind of cash and debt neutral now, and I guess if so, Q2 and Q3 you used cash flow that much. So I\u2019m just wondering, should we expect to later buyback in the next couple of quarters, just given you have cash flow quite is season \u2013 from a seasonal perspective? Jack Prim : Well, I would tell you, Dave, we actually have our board meeting next week and that\u2019s a topic that comes up every quarter. I think the plans this year is to continue to take a few shares off the table. The use of the revolver is \u2013 it doesn\u2019t bother us to succeed by shares, because obviously next summer we\u2019ll have another inflow of cash. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see us lever up a whole bunch to buy back stock, but I think we\u2019ll continue to take some off the table. Dave Koning \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Okay, great. Thank you. Jack Prim : Thanks Dave. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes is from Brett Huff with Stephens Incorporated. Your line is open. Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc : Good morning guys. Jack Prim : Good morning Brett. Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc : A couple of quick questions. Just to make sure that I understood the last comment that you made on the repo pace Kevin. I think that you had mentioned at the end of the last call that you guys were thinking maybe a million shares through the year. Are you giving us any more clarity on that specific number, or any color on that? Kevin Williams : Well, I mean we decided to go ahead and take a million this quarter Brett. I don\u2019t know \u2013 I mean, that was kind of the direction I had from the board going into this quarter after the board meeting in August, was to go ahead and take a million off. So again the board will talk about this next week and give me some more clarification on how much more to take. So I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll take some more off the table Brett. So if you want to assume that we\u2019ll take another million shares off for the balance of the year, that\u2019s probably not a bad assumption. Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then in terms of some of the spending you guys are doing, I think I understand what those items are. As we look out, you said that you expect the margins to start to go up or expand again sort of once we get through this [indiscernible] of some of the spending. Can you tell us about those expectations for free cash flow growth next year as we\u2019re thinking about the impact of maybe moderating spending, or at least not any increases next year on that metric? Jack Prim : Well, as we said on the last call, Brett, I don\u2019t think anything has changed. I mean margins are going to remain relatively flat this fiscal year. I think you\u2019ll see some expansion margins next year. I think we could see some expansion in EBITDA margins even this year, as the DNA continues to increase from prior and current CapEx and cap software that we\u2019ve been spending on. So I think free cash flow should go back to a nice increase in the next fiscal year. Some of the CapEx that we spent this quarter obviously the fourth plan, which is not going to have a huge impact on depreciation, because we obviously got rid of a plan, as the process went on. Some of the CapEx as I mentioned as some of our shared storage, which a lot of that is driven by the \u2013 getting ready to put up the hosted network services and some other things we\u2019re doing, all of our back in imaging and different things. So these are the things that will continue to grow. And again to your point, free cash flow should go back to a nice growth trajectory next fiscal year. Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc : Okay. And then one housekeeping thing, in-house backlog. I think you guys had said last quarter that you were not going to continue telling us the outsource backlog number because it didn\u2019t make a bunch of sense. Have you stopped using in-house backlog as well, or what \u2013 could you give us that number? Kevin Williams : We decided, Brett, we\u2019re just not going to give backlog. We took so many different things moving in and out of there and we\u2019re just going to give that on an annual basis in the 10-K. Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc : Okay. And then last question, this is more on product. Obviously mobile banking continues to be something that\u2019s popular. Jack, I think in the last call you said that the economics can be a little bit variable and there is a lot of competition. What can you tell us on sort of how you all are thinking about your product development, or how your sales folks or your usage is looking on mobile banking, relative to use of internet banking. Are you seeing a shift? Is internet banking usage declining as mobile banking is picking up, and what\u2019s kind of the impact for product development for you on that? Jack Prim : Well, we\u2019re seeing solid growth in mobile banking, Brett, both in the existing mobile apps that we had prior to the Banno acquisition. We\u2019ve kind of put out a refreshed set of applications for our Girdle [ph] product which have been very well received by the client base and sales of that product remains very strong. The Banno Mobile product is selling well. We\u2019ve released a tablet application. With the same time, there is still a need for continued investment in the internet banking solutions. So I don\u2019t know that I could quote you clear statistics on what\u2019s happening to internet banking usage relative to mobile. I think mobile is clearly on the uptrend. I\u2019m not seeing anything that at least makes it believe there is any significant downturn in usage on the traditional internet banking solutions. And there seems to be a lot of ongoing demand for further enhancement and improvement on some of those systems as well. So I think my gut feel, not supported by any evidence, is that the internet banking usage is staying very solid and we\u2019re seeing significant growth in usage on the mobile side. Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc : Okay. And then last question on competition. You talked a little bit about some competitive takeaways, were those from \u2013 in general, are those from Fiserv or D+H or other sort of smaller platform. You want to hone in on that? Jack Prim : We pretty much take a good cross section of the industry. So the contributors are going to be largely weighted to what the market share is in the credit union industry. So we\u2019ll replace some of everybody on an annual basis, and certainly some folks have a larger presence in the credit union industry. So we\u2019ll tend to contribute a little more to that. Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc : Okay, that\u2019s wonderful. Thanks guys. I appreciate it. Kevin Williams : Thanks Brett. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our next question is from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co: Thank you. Good morning guys. I guess the first question, you may have alluded to us \u2013 sorry, I jumped on the call, but the credit union growth a little bit slower 4%, 5%. In the context, it sounds like you feel pretty good about the competitive situation, but maybe give a little bit of color for somewhat slower growth of peers in the credit union market? Jack Prim : Yes, I think mainly, Glenn, that we had a very significant growth last year in the credit union space, and so it\u2019s \u2013 compared to the year ago quarter, it\u2019s a bit more of a tough comp, but again very steady. Certainly anticipate as we\u2019ve been saying for a year and a half now, that we do expect to see more competition from the \u2013 as a result of the Fiserv and Open Solutions acquisition. And certainly I think their efforts have been focused on retaining their existing customers. And so we\u2019ve certainly would have expected that would be the case. I said that from the very beginning, and I think that certainly has been where a lot of their focus has been, but we\u2019re still winning our fair share of the new opportunities in the market and still feel good about our opportunities. Kevin Williams : And Glenn, the support and services line within the credit union segment was still over 7% growth. So it was really just some tough comp in the license and hardware, which were both down quite a bit in the quarter, just because of primarily the timing of delivery. There were some bigger deals delivered last quarter than this quarter, but the lion\u2019s share of revenue is still support services and still growing very nicely. Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co: Okay. Do you think your competitive win rates stable, up or down, relative to a year ago? Jack Prim : It\u2019s relatively stable at this point, Glenn. Again as I have said for some time now, I would expect that to moderate some based on getting some of the things worked out on that particular acquisition, but at this point, it\u2019s still pretty stable. Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co: Stable. Okay. And then Kevin on the full-year, just the growth we saw in payments and outsourcing in this quarter. Is that kind of reasonable, similar kind of growth expectations on a full-year basis that we\u2019re thinking about? Kevin Williams : Yes. That\u2019s pretty much the guidelines. I think payments will continue to grow in the high-single-digits and outlink should be in the low-double-digits for the year. Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co: Okay. And then the trends in the in-house to outsource, is that just sort of continue or any acceleration in the movement towards outsource, because actually outsource, it looks like it accelerated a bit? Kevin Williams : It\u2019s pretty stable, Glenn, just to continue going on. I mean it accelerated a little bit, because remember, last year there were some sizable deconversion fees in there that kind of made some tough comp and everything. So it\u2019s just kind of [indiscernible] now. Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co: Okay. And then on margins, it sounded like you kind of reaffirm sort of the flattish margin expectation. You\u2019ve been kind of doing that for a while and over-delivering on your promises. Is there a potential for upside to margins for this year and what would be the catalyst for that? Kevin Williams : Glenn, we\u2019ve always tried to tell you what we think what we\u2019re going to do, and then we try to do it or beat it, so not much changes in there. Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co: Okay. Thanks a lot. Kevin Williams : Thanks Glenn. Operator : Thank you. And I\u2019m not showing any further questions. Mr. Williams, please proceed with any further remarks. Kevin Williams : Thanks Bridget. Again, we want to thank you all for joining us today to review our first quarter fiscal 2015 results.

Baird Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer Peter Heckmann - Avondale Brett Huff - Stephens Incorporated Operator : Good day ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Jack Henry & Associates\u2019 Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. But later we will be conducting a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program Kevin Williams, sir you have the floor. Kevin Williams : Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for the Jack Henry & Associates\u2019 second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. I am Kevin Williams, CFO, on the call with me today is Jack Prim, our CEO. The agenda for the call this morning will follow the way we typically do Jack will start out with his thoughts on the performance of the quarter and some other comments. I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we\u2019ve put out yesterday, and then we will open the lines for Q&A. I need to remind you that remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate, due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday\u2019s press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled, Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jack. Jack Prim : Thanks Kevin. Good morning. Today\u2019s earnings call would be a bit of a challenge to present because of a number of one-time events that occurred in the quarter including the gain on sale associated with the disposition of a non-strategic product group. The retroactive reinstatement of the research and experimentation tax credit and a one-time adjustment to revenue based on a new interpretation of revenue recognition policies by our outside accounting firm. Kevin will attempt to provide some clarity that will allow for an effective apples-to-apples comparison to the prior year quarter, the noise in the numbers this quarter excurse at a glance a solid operating quarter. In particular without the accounting revenue adjustment and let me repeat without the accounting revenue adjustment we had a quarter in which organic revenue growth was just under 8%, with support and services revenue up 10%, led by a 15% growth in our outsourcing business and a 10% growth in our payments business. The growth in these businesses offset what would have been a decline of 14% a year-over-year in license fees and we maintained strong gross margins in spite of this lower high margin component of revenue. Business fundamentals remained strong and in a solid and still improving economic environment. Our clients continue to invest in solutions that can help them drive revenue, reduced cost and improved security. We have solid sales performances across all three brands with strong core and complimentary sales in the Banking and Credit Union segments and are strong outside the core base performance by the ProfitStars team. In reference to the previously mentioned revenue adjustment for our in-house clients we have historically recognized revenue as the software is delivered and implemented by the client which we believe most accurately represents the intended financial arrangement. We have recently received guidance from our accounting firm, that if even a single small software product on that contract is not implemented, we should defer all revenue on the agreement. I would point out that we have followed substantially the same recognition policies for many years adjusted as necessary to accommodate new accounting guidelines as they have emerged. There have been no recent changes to our policies and none during the five year period that was reviewed. We have not received a satisfactory explanation - previously acceptable recognition policies have now been called into question. While we are confident that our policies have been fully compliant with GAAP and more accurately reflect the intentions of the arrangements with our clients. We are modifying our policies to comply with this new interpretation. These adjustments related to license fees and associated implementation fees are included in the earnings release. The review of software maintenance is ongoing and unfortunately could not be completed by the time our earnings release. The first time a question related to maintenance was post to us was Monday night at 11 pm. As I said earlier it was a noisy quarter with a number of puts and takes but when you net that all out it was as solid operational quarter with continued strong organic growth and margins. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin for some additional details. Kevin Williams : Thanks Jack. As Jack mentioned all the numbers disclosed in the press release that I\u2019m going to talk about were adjusted for the revenue recognition just was disclosed in the press release. The total impact of adjustments in the current quarter was to decrease revenue by $1.2 million and a decreased operating income by $0.06 million compared to the adjustments made for the second quarter last year which again we are going to restate proactively quarters going forward so that the prior year historical numbers be adjusted each quarter. And adjustment to the second quarter of last year was to increase revenue by $2.4 million and an increased operating income by $1.5 billion, which obviously this changed the comps a little. Without these adjustments as Jack mentioned our revenue would have grown 8% compared to the 6% reported. And our operating income would have shown growth of 6% versus the 4%. Our support and service line of revenue continues to drive our whole revenue growth, it increased to $299.6 million which is a 9% increase, to break that down between the components our implementation revenue was at $26.9 million for a 16% increase. Our electronic payments was at $121.5 million for a 10%, our outsourcing, our outlink data processing was $67 million a 15% increase; and our in-house maintenance was at $84.2 million for a 1% increase. The recurring revenue which is based to the payments outlink and in-house maintenance grew at about 8.5% growth for the quarter and represent a 79%. As Jack mentioned our margins continue to be strong, our consolidated gross margins decreased slightly, they rounded down to 43% for the quarter compared to 44% in last year\u2019s quarter. License margins decreased really at the level of 92%. And for both this quarter and last year support and service margins with a level of 42% and hardware margins increased to 31% from 29% a year ago due to sales mix. I do have to apologize as Jack mentioned we kind of got here with some things at 11 o\u2019clock Monday night so I did not have any breakdown margins for these segments. We\u2019ll have to get those to you later, so again I apologize that overall the segments are going to be pretty much in line with where they have been. And our total gross margins continue to be strong, our total operating expenses increased 5% for the quarter compared to the prior year. Our operating margin for the quarter remained fairly flat at 27% was down less than 1% from last year. Our operating income increased 4% for the quarter, organic operating income increased a little over 5% compared to last year as the acquisition of Banno that we did last March continues to be slightly dilutive to our operations. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.8% compared to 35.2% last year which is primarily due to reinstatement of the R&E credit. Our net income increased 7% for the quarter compared to last year. So EPS of 72% was up 13% over the last year which is impacted obviously positive by our stock buybacks. To breakdown the noise in the quarter, you start out with the $0.72 that we reported, there was about a 4% impact from the total web product sales. There was about a $0.03 impact from the R&E credit and then there was about $0.02 of one-time expenses in the quarter that went the other way. And then the revenue recognition impact was a little less than $0.01 in the quarter which is about a $0.04 net take out which gives you down to a write out about a 68% EPS from operations compared to the $0.67 consensus estimate out there. Our EBITDA increased to $118.3 million for the quarter compared to $110.8 million a year-ago or approximately 7% increase. Depreciation and amortization expense of $59.4 million year-to-date with $27.4 million depreciation and $31.9 million in amortization. Amortization for intangibles from acquisitions was relatively flat at about $10.5 million compared to last year. Free cash flow was down slightly this year primarily due to the timing of the annual maintenance billings collections in June of last year compared to last year we collect a lot more before this year started which is the primary impact for our cash flow. As far as guidance going forward there is no change to our guidance, we continue to expect our top line revenues in the same growth range that we've seen. We expect margins to be relatively flat as they have been year-to-date. They were basically almost exactly flat with last year, was the guidance we gave going into this year. So that concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions. Andrew will you please open the call lines up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] At this time we're going to be taking our first question from the line of Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Kevin just a couple questions on your recognition issue, what was the catalyst that forced this change or made the hardest look at it? Kevin Williams : Well I would say Kartik we were notified I believe in October by our IR firm that they were being reviewed by the PCOB. And we had been fortunate enough to be selected for that review. And that\u2019s pretty much when it started and it\u2019s really kind of kicked off about Thanks Giving but I would tell you it really didn\u2019t heat up until last week. Kartik Mehta : And then how many of the products are included, is it just one product or is it several? Kevin Williams : Well it\u2019s really a couple of different things Kartik and obviously I don\u2019t want to get too deep in the weeds here but the first phase was the recognized review on multi-product contracts. And so the way we have always looking as revenue in the way us and our legal department have always zeroed contracts that we had multiple contracts with our customers under wiling kind of a general addendum. And what we would do was we would ship software and we would recognize revenue and build that as implemented the software. So if a piece of software part of that multi product contract was not delivered for two years. We didn\u2019t ship the software we didn\u2019t recognize it and obviously the customer and pay for it under the new interpretation, we are required to, once the contract is signed. We were required to ship 100% of the software or we can\u2019t recognize any revenue from the software implementation, maintenance or anything until that last piece of software is shipped. So even if we have a customer that have let\u2019s say our Synapse [ph] solution, they know they\u2019re not going to install for two years under the old methodology we wouldn\u2019t have shipped it because it wouldn\u2019t make any sense because what we were, ship them on the days signed contract, is not the same piece of software we\u2019d have installed two years later anyway. But under today\u2019s guidelines we couldn\u2019t recognize any revenue for the SilverLake software implementation or anything else until we shipped that last piece of software. So that\u2019s where it\u2019s come down to, its they said we had to go back and defer all those revenues and put the supports of those winnings and deferred revenue that\u2019d be recognized in the future. And that\u2019s pretty much I\u2019m not sure what it is. Jack Prim : And Kartik just to clarify a little bit there, that relates to software and related implementation fees and that has washed through at this point, those adjustments are reflected in the earnings release that we've put out. The open item is the software maintenance which again we've had less than 48 hours to work on and so similar kind of concept but again everything Kevin just described has already been adjusted and accounted for the in the financials. Kartik Mehta : Okay and then just your thoughts on the competition the credit union market, have you seen any change at all or how you view your position? Jack Prim : We have not Kartik we have in the credit union space 14 new core sales this year which is tracking reasonably in line with last year. And so answer to your question is no the competitive dynamic really is exactly the same, essentially the same in the banking and credit union segments at this point. Kevin Williams : Yeah in fact Kartik personally it should just hit through your inbox that we post this morning of the Symitar wins in the first half. We signed 14 new takeaways and actually had 14 in the first half signed contracts to move from in-house outsourcing. Kartik Mehta : Kevin, what\u2019s going to be tax rate now going forward? I\u2019m assuming that changes a little bit? Kevin Williams : Yeah it\u2019s going to be about 35%for the year Kartik. I mean obviously it went way down this quarter because had to take foreclosure for the impact of the R&E credit but before the year and going forward for the next two quarters you could probably use about 35% to be in the ballpark. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line from Dave Koning from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Dave Koning : Hey guys nice job on the core business. And I\u2019m just wondering the electronic, like the payments business grew 10% I think that\u2019s the strongest in the last fourth quarters. And maybe you can just talk about kind of what\u2019s happening there with the acceleration? Jack Prim : Yeah Dave there is I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any one thing I would call out, we had good growth in our bill payments, businesses, debit card growth rate is little slower but in our ATM transaction processing grew nicely. Certainly there are no deposit capture, continues to grow quite nicely. Don\u2019t know that there\u2019s any particular items that stand out, it\u2019s just continued, customers being added with various payment processing services. Dave Koning : Good and then how big was TeleWeb about just so we can kind of take those out of the some of the year-ago periods just to get apples-to-apples comparison? Kevin Williams : Yeah Dave don\u2019t hover this with our, the operating income from those products was right at a $1 million. The revenue from that - if knew or read correct it was about $5 million. Dave Koning : Okay. And those are both the annual? Kevin Williams : Yeah annual revenue was $5 million or $6 million and operating income was a $1 million. Those came through the Audiotel acquisition back in 2007 those were not strategic parts going forward, that\u2019s not why we did the acquisition. And those were just kind of dwindling down because they were not really market products. So we made the decision that it was best to go ahead and sell them, take - get some cash out of them before we just watched and go to nothing. Dave Koning : And I think that you talked a little bit about the gain I think the last 10-Q you said it was a $3 million gain in and then the one-time expenses about half as big the way you describe it. So those one-time expenses must have been like a $1.5 or something like that. Kevin Williams : Yeah just right at $2 million which include some long-time bonuses and just some other comps we just have in the quarter were all one-time cost Dave. Dave Koning : Okay. All right good job. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Glenn Greene : Not to believe where the whole accounting issue but I guess one question first the order of magnitude of the issue on the software maintenance side. It sounded like the changes in the reinstatements you made very immaterial which is one question really why they even made you do this but just trying to understand the order of magnitude the software maintenance revenue. And then related to this - is this like new GAAP accounting regulation or just like an interpretation that your orders have? Jack Prim : Well you asked a whole series of questions here Glenn. So first let me just say that the adjustments, that we already made is clearly just a different interpretation of existing GAAP rules. This is all under SOP 97-2 that\u2019s been in place for a long time. We have complied with that for years, we have not changed anything we did but apparently our audit firm decided to look differently at it, they brought in different partners. And my understanding is the big for our firms kind of have their own set of interpretations. And that\u2019s the direction they are going, so we're kind of required to comply with it. And so we will make the changes and I\u2019ll tell you that going forward you\u2019ll have little to no impact on our revenue recognition, we\u2019ll just adhere or pauses though so we can kind of continue to recognize revenues where we have been. So it\u2019s not a big deal but it\u2019s just a kind of restatement and getting a repaying adjusted going forward for the prior year for comparison purposes. Again there\u2019s going to be a little noise for the next three or four quarters as we restate historical\u2019s on a year-over-year comparison. As far as the maintenance fees, I honestly believe that\u2019s going to be immaterial going in because really all of doing is looking at the DSOE of maintenance which we are very, very confident that we have DSOE which is kind of term soon out there but it really comes down to the timing of when maintenance is recognized. So it really relates primarily to the maintenance associated with new license sales in any given year and when that maintenance should be recognized. So in my opinion it\u2019s going to be clearly immaterial but it\u2019s just one thing that we have got to go through and get documented and prove to the audit firm where we are and what it is. Kevin Williams : And Glenn I think it\u2019s probably obvious but just for clarity, whatever happens with maintenance, the revenue doesn\u2019t go away, it either gets pushed forward and gets pulled back. So there\u2019s potentially some movement between quarters or possibly overlapping fiscal years but it\u2019s just where it ends up being allocated to rather than not being allocated anywhere. Glenn Greene : Different question, so on the competitor side you talked about this a little bit on the Symitar. And I did see the press release. So just to put it in context the 14 competitive takeaway, is that a similar number to what you had in the first half of \u201914 and is roughly distributed across sort of market shares as we would think it would be. And also the conversions from in-house to outsource that 14 which I think that\u2019s a different independent number. Is that comparable to what you saw on first half of \u201914 also? Kevin Williams : Yeah the new core wins is almost exactly inline Glenn, I think last year we might have had 15 in the first half but it\u2019s pretty much right inline. And just like last year we haven\u2019t lost any. And the conversions from in-house outsource that\u2019s actually accelerated a little bit from what we saw in the first half of last year. Jack Prim : Yeah it\u2019s about the distribution I would just say that 9 of the 14 came from one vendor and rest were scattered out among other vendors. Glenn Greene : That\u2019s helpful. And just finally to clarify the margin guidance were flattish for the year? Does that include all these one-time items in the quarter or how should we think about the impact of these one-time, the net effect of these one-time items to that margin commentary? Kevin Williams : Immaterial. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning this is Reena Kumar [ph] for David Togut. On the TeleWeb gain was that all included in your G&A line? Kevin Williams : Yes. Unidentified Analyst : And cost of support and services, I see that grew 10% above revenue growth. Were there any one-time items there? And I guess if not what were the drivers of that increase? Kevin Williams : There was a few one-time things, the biggest driver within that increase was personal cost which there was some one-time special bonus type things in there but also depreciation, amortization in the quarter which we've talked about for the last three or four earnings calls from the investments that we've made in our infrastructure, the depreciation, amortization went up. The other thing I\u2019d point out on G&A is yeah the one-time gains from Teleweb\u2019s in there but also if remember last year there was about a $3 million insurance proceeds from settlement from the Lyndhurst Tobacco from the year before that, so just comparing to apples-to-apples as you kind of get back both those. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s helpful. Are you seeing increased competition from Fiserv\u2019s DNA product? Kevin Williams : No. Unidentified Analyst : Can you provide us an update on your estimate for FY15 capitalized software and internally used software? I think you were saying it was flattish for the year but you were up 26% in the quarter? Kevin Williams : For what? Unidentified Analyst : Capitalized software? Kevin Williams : For capitalized software I said we're going to be up for capitalized software compared to last year but it has leveled off. And this 2Q was pretty much inline in level with Q1. So we've said all along that it\u2019s going to go up. I mean that\u2019s kind of being the trend because of all the major projects we have gone on. Unidentified Analyst : Did the expected 20% plus increase over the next two quarters in line with the first two quarters? Kevin Williams : Yes. Unidentified Analyst : And just one final question, could you just call up the term fees in the quarter? Kevin Williams : They were up about $2 million over the same quarter last year. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Peter Heckmann from Avondale. Your line is open. Peter Heckmann : I wanted to follow-up on the CapEx side, it looked like CapEx was little bit lower than I expected in the quarter after ramping up a little bit ahead of some of the things you\u2019re doing with infrastructure as a service given three, four, five months since the formal introduction of that service. Can you give us an update? Kevin Williams : Yeah I mean outside Peter, there was a significant amount of CapEx in Q1 for a couple of things, one obviously we took the estimate of the deferred claim but also we accelerated in the first quarter quite a bit of the new storage capacity that we were putting in place because one of the things that you can\u2019t be half pregnant. So we went ahead and we put a lot of boxes in. And so we should be good for storage now for sometime. So CapEx will level off little bit, the CapEx is still probably going to be in the 65ish million or so for the year. Peter Heckmann : And any initial commentary on the infrastructure operations for the effort? Kevin Williams : Just that it\u2019s going quite well and Pete we have greatly expanded the scope of our testing environments. We feel very comfortable that we've accomplished what we set out to do but significantly improving our disaster of avoid and send recovery capabilities. Peter Heckmann : Great and then in this regard, we've seen a little bit of uptick in M&A and the banking space, anything worth calling out there or is it too soon to tell in terms of potential opportunities or losses from bank consolidations? Jack Prim : Well obviously one of our larger customer\u2019s Susquehanna Bancshares and Lititz Pennsylvania was one of the acquires announced late last half of 2014, that was not the way we would like to think that transaction going down but again we did not have any single customer that represents more than 0.5% of our total revenue, so it was much, we hate to see those folks go away. The financial impact would not be there but for the general environment, there clearly a merger activity going on, I don\u2019t know that from what we've seen it is significantly different than what we've seen for the last couple of years. Our implementation teams particularly on the banking side, they have been full to capacity for probably the last two years. I don\u2019t know that their backlog is any bigger right now than it has been. Peter Heckmann : And just as a quick follow-up or as a reminder, Susquehanna as an in-house installation correct? Kevin Williams : Yes. Peter Heckmann : All right I\u2019ll get back in the queue. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens Incorporated. Your line is open. Brett Huff : On the license Kevin I don\u2019t know if, Jack I don\u2019t think you talked about this but the license was down but there was some caveat you put on that decline, can you just go over that for me again? Jack Prim : I don\u2019t know if Kevin put a caveat - or idea Brett my point was that, so obviously there was $2 million adjustment and I think most of that landed in the license. So my comments were taking that out. We would have been down about 14% on license fees as compared to - I don\u2019t have right in front of me at the moment but 26%. Brett Huff : And that\u2019s treating the license the same in both that\u2019s apples-to-apples now? Jack Prim : Yes. Brett Huff : Okay. And then in terms of buyback and things like that with all the accounting open item on the software maintenance, what can you guys do in terms of buyback and stuff. Was there any change to what you can do there? Jack Prim : No there\u2019s no change because once it\u2019s probably acknowledged Brett as long as anybody else can buy, the company can buy back stock. Obviously we were blacked out until we announced earnings anyway but if we had to remain blacked out for that reason, then obviously we would not have been able to be in the market until that became probably acknowledged. Brett Huff : Okay. And then last question on the infrastructure question follow-up that\u2019s asked before. I think you - this has been generally available for four or six months is that right? Jack Prim : Yeah actually Brett I might have misunderstood Pete\u2019s question earlier. I thought he was referring to the capital investment, so that Kevin had just finished talking about related some of the infrastructure for our own systems or outsourcing processing systems etcetera but related to what I think you\u2019re referring to which is our hosted network solutions that we mentioned a while back, we officially put that in the hands of our sales team in July at the start of the fiscal year. It has received a significant amount of interest, we've had a number of sales closed, I look at the report every month from the forecast of the number of deals that are in the evaluation stage. And it\u2019s a steep and steady upward to the right climb if you charted out of banks that have shown interest in that. It is a complex sale just, it\u2019s A, it\u2019s network that\u2019s a pretty significant level of complexity. And other factors make it a fairly complex sale cycle. But we're very pleased with the response that we're saying relatively two quarters into having the service generally available. Brett Huff : And I think, I know it was last quarter or a quarter before that you guys seem to say that, it\u2019d be this fiscal year you didn\u2019t think there would be a whole lot of revenue from this just given that you had started this year. Do you still feel that way and or can you give us a sense of how quickly given the complexity of the sale. Is that late this year where it\u2019s the kind of thing you could put numbers around from a revenue point of view or is that more of a next fiscal year discussion? Kevin Williams : Well Brett we talked about this last year, I think we talked about at the Analyst Day but I know we talked about at various call last year. And it\u2019s one of those things that it\u2019s going to slowly ramp up because it\u2019s all, some are the outsourced servicing. So it\u2019s one bank at a time, there\u2019s no license fee or anything. So it\u2019s just layering on and obviously we've got some nice momentum there. We got some nice contracts in place but it\u2019s also one of those things were bank will listen to this field because of the complexity to say, that\u2019s sound pretty good but you know what? What out of 60 servers here, take three let\u2019s see how it works and then we\u2019ll a year from now. So we've got some of that going on, so it\u2019s going to be a slow building thing. So it\u2019s kind of like we said, last summer if going into next fiscal year and probably the Analyst Day. We\u2019ll be able to give you a whole lot better idea of what type of revenue we can expect for FY16 than we can now. Brett Huff : Okay, that\u2019s all I needed. Thanks for your help. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And I have follow-up from Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Glenn Greene : Hey Kevin I know you don\u2019t have the margins for those segments because of the recounting issues but your best guesses what the margins might look like, if you didn\u2019t have those accounting issues? Just wondering sort of get through actual terms there. Kevin Williams : Yeah I would tell you Glenn I think - there is some impact from those but it\u2019s not going to be significant but banking was about 42% or 43% for the quarter, so just down slightly from a year-ago because the decrease in license revenues. Credit unions margins were probably about flat at that 45%. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And it looks like we have no questioners in the queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to speakers. Kevin Williams : Thanks Andrew. Again we want to thank you for joining us today to review our second quarter fiscal 2015 results. We're pleased with the overall results from our ongoing operations and very pleased with the efforts of all of our associates, that take care of all of our customers. Our executives, managers and all the associates continue to focus on what\u2019s best for our customers and our shareholders. With that I want to thank you again. And Andrew would please provide the replay number? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation in today\u2019s conference. The replay number is going to be 800-585-8367, that\u2019s 800-585-8367. Thank you very much for your participation again. And have a great day.",

Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc. Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker) Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Jack Henry & Associates Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Williams, CFO. Please begin. Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Thank you, Latoya. Good morning. Thank you again for joining us for the Jack Henry & Associates Third Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO of the company; and on the call with me today is Jack Prim, our CEO. The agenda for the call this morning will be as we normally do, Jack will start out with some thoughts about the business, the performance for the quarter and some other comments he has prepared, then I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market close, and then we will open the call up for Q&A as we always do. I need to remind you that remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jack. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Kevin. Good morning. As has been mentioned previously and as will be discussed in more detail on the call, the review of our revenue recognition procedures will result in a restatement of prior period financials. The presentation of the financials for discussion this morning are in the same format as they have been provided in previous years, together with a reconciliation from the estimated restated financials for your comparison purposes. Looking at the comparison on that apples-to-apples basis would show another solid operating performance with organic revenue growth of 7% and operating income growth of 17%. This is despite the continued trend of declines in high-margin license fee revenues, down 18% in the quarter, and hardware down 17%. These declines are not unexpected given the continuing trends and preference for hosted delivery of services and the general lumpy nature of these revenue categories. The declines were more than offset by the solid growth of 10% in Support and Services, which makes up 92% of our total revenue. The performance was strong in both the Banking and Credit Union segments, led by our Payments and Outsourcing businesses, up 9% and 18% respectively. Sales performances across all three brands remained strong and ahead of plan. Although the final stages of the lengthy and detailed review of revenue recognition procedures are still under way, we believe we have better clarity as to the resolution of this issue. From a timing standpoint, we expect to have all adjustments made and bring all SEC filings current not later than June 30, 2015. Over the last several months, the process has evolved following a recently disclosed interpretation of license and implementation fee revenue recognition guidelines by our auditors as discussed in the December earnings call to become much broader in scope and include reviews of Vendor Specific Objective Evidence, or VSOE, related to software maintenance and implementation fees. In that process, the cumulative effect and the requirement to adopt the most conservative possible positions related to revenue recognition also impacted the expected materiality of the adjustments. Our initial reviews appeared to indicate that any required adjustments would be immaterial in nature. We now believe the adjustment will be approximately $172 million and require a material restatement. The cumulative restatement will result in balance sheet adjustments to retained earnings and short- and long-term deferred revenue, and a restatement of our income statements for the previous three years. While it will affect the timing of recognition of license fees and certain other deliverables under multi-element contracts, it does not impact the amount of revenue to be recognized, total contract values, cash flow or payment terms, just the period in which some revenue is recognized. It remains our opinion that we have consistently recognized revenue in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 and its amendments, if not in accordance with our auditors' interpretation of the 97-2 guidance. Now that we are aware of their interpretations, we have made the necessary changes and adjustments retroactively and to our policies going forward. While this review process has been distracting for our accounting department and their management, the fundamentals of our business remain strong in terms of sales results, customer satisfaction and employee engagement. We will continue to focus on running the business in the best interest of our customers and shareholders for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for some additional comments. Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Thanks, Jack. I thought the first thing I'd do this morning is try to explain a little bit of why this process has taken so long, and then also to explain at a high level what we've been required to do to adjust our financial statements for the change in interpretation of SOP 97-2 that Jack referred to, and why the numbers look a little odd. For example why license revenue looks to be so low. The first thing that we had to do was go back and determine all the contracts that had the last deliverable of a multi-element contract delivered and installed during the past five-year period. Then we had to determine when that multi-element contract was actually signed and determine the timing and original revenue recognition for all the related elements of that contract were installed and delivered. So the license implementation fees and subsequent maintenance, or post contract services, we had to determine the timing of all recognition of all those pieces. Then we had to back out all the revenue related to those contracts in regards to all the different components of the revenue. And in that respective quarter that it had been originally recognized, regardless of the quarter, put all that revenue into a deferred revenue account and then begin recognizing 100% of that revenue ratably over the remaining maintenance contract period upon the installation of the last product that was part of that multi-element group. So this related to literally tens of thousands of contracts and millions of lines of billing. So it was a very complex and tedious process, which is why it took so long. This creates a large rolling impact as revenue, as you back revenue out of multiple quarters and then you recognize that revenue for that contract when the last element is installed in a subsequent quarter. This had to be done for the previous five years due to the summary financial data that will be included in the Amended 10-K, when we file it for last year. The impact of this five year rolling impact for the time period from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2014 is what grew to the projected numbers that Jack just referred to $172 million deferred revenue and $71 million impact or decrease in retained earnings as of June 30, 2014. And the difference in those two numbers being the direct related increased pre-paid direct costs and the decrease in deferred tax liability tied to that income. To give you an example of the impact for the quarter just reported, from our historical reporting license as historically reported was then decreased $12 million. Implementation services were reduced $7.5 million. In-house maintenance was decreased by $5.4 million, which reflects all the revenue related to the products related to these multi-element contracts installed in the quarter. We then added back $13 million in revenue of bundled product line within Support and Services for the contracts that were deferred and actually final installation in this quarter and then ratably recognized. This resulted in a net decrease of $11.9 million in revenue for the quarter as reflected in that summary financial data schedule that we put in the release yesterday. For comparative purposes for the same quarter a year ago, we backed out $14.7 million in license, $6.6 million implementation and $4.8 million in in-house maintenance, and then we added back these bundled services of the combination of those that were finally installed in the quarter ratably for the quarter of $16.6 million. So it's an in and out which leads to that rolling number. And this led to a net decrease for the year-ago quarter of $9.5 million in revenue, which was also reflected in the summary financial data schedule that was in the yesterday's release. There were a couple of other things that impacted timing of different types of revenue, but this was the lion's share of it. Hopefully, this helps to explain what caused these restated numbers and why some of the numbers like license revenues look a little odd. The bundled services line will be shown as a separate component and analyzed separately in the MD&A in the future SEC filings. So when we do file the 10-K/A and 10-Q/A, those will be broken out separately within Support and Services. Again, I would like to remind you, as Jack said, this only impacts the timing of revenue. It didn't no way impacts total contract value, the total revenue to be recognized from these contracts and has absolutely no impact on our cash flows nor the timing of our cash flows. So those will be consistent going forward. Concerning the adjustments, I will make my comments to the restated amounts in the release yesterday, and also refer to the summary table that compares historically reported numbers to the restated amounts. Support and Service lines of revenue continue to drive our total revenue growth and at restate \u2013 and an increase to restated $296.9 million, which is an 8% increase over the same quarter a year ago of $276.1 million. Again those are restated numbers. And now Support and Services represents 96% of total restated revenue this year compared to 95% a year ago with taking \u2013 reducing the license and putting it into Support and Services. To give you a breakdown like I always do of Support and Services comparison for the quarter, implementation was $18.9 million versus $17.9 million or a 6% increase. Electronic payments was $119.3 million versus $109.3 million, increased 9%. OutLink was $69.7 million versus $59 million or an 18% increase. Obviously electronic payments and OutLink were not impacted by this revenue recognition. In-House Maintenance was $76 million this year, compared to $73.3 million or a 4% increase. And then the bundled service component line of Support and Services this quarter was $13 million, compared to $16.6 million or a 22% decrease for the quarter compared to prior year. The Support and Services breakdown for the year-to-date numbers, since you won't have that and I'll give that to you now : Implementation was $56.9 million versus $47.8 million last year, a 19% increase; electronic payments, $360.2 million versus $329.4 million or a 9% increase; OutLink $199.8 million versus $173 million which is a 15% increase; In-House Maintenance, $235.7 million versus $231.1 million or a 2% increase; and then that bundled services component that's in Support and Services now was $29.5 million this year-to-date for the first three quarters versus $30.6 million a year ago, or a 4% decrease. Obviously, when we file the amended SEC filings on our Form 10-K/A and Form 10-Q/A we will provide all the quarterly detail for these revenue account breakouts for your models for all the previous years. Our consolidated restated gross margin increased to 43% for the quarter, compared to 40% in last year's quarter. Hardware margins remain level at 25% for the quarter, compared to a year ago. Our total restated operating expenses increased 3% for the quarter, compared to prior year. Our operating margin for the quarter increased to 25% for the quarter, compared to 22% a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter is relatively flat with last year at 33.7% this year versus 32.8%. So our restated EPS of $0.63 was up 26% over last year, which was impacted positively by the stock buybacks in the first half of the year. Our EPS prior to restatement was $0.68, or that's the way we've historically reported it, which is up 24% from $0.55 last year. And just to remind you the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter was $0.62. So we actually exceeded the consensus estimate either with the historical or restated numbers. Our restated EBITDA for the quarter increased to $109.6 million for the quarter, compared to $92 million a year, or approximately a 19% increase. Depreciation and amortization expense of $89.1 million year-to-date with $41 million in depreciation and $48.1 million in amortization, which this compared to $79.5 million in depreciation and amortization last year. Included in the total amortization is amortization intangibles from acquisitions, which was down slightly to $15.3 million year-to-date, compared to $15.7 million last year. Our restated operating cash flows were up $20.1 million year-to-date or 12% to $181.6 million. Our free cash flows for the year-to-date before dividends is $1.06 per share, this compared to $0.97 a year ago or up approximately just slightly under 10%. There were no treasury shares purchased during the quarter due to the revenue recognition issues. We have always been very conservative when our board and executives are blacked out. We do not allow them to buy stocks; therefore we don't allow the company to buy stock. I will tell you as soon as we get current with our filings, we will re-evaluate getting back in the market to buy back our own shares. For FY 2015 guidance for the remainder of this year, there really is no change in the guidance. We continue to expect top line revenue growth in the same growth range as we've seen year-to-date. For the fourth quarter, the current consensus estimate is currently $0.68, which we are comfortable with this on a restated basis. So the $0.68 consensus estimate for the year will be good. And this would allow us to end the year with EPS growth of slightly over 15%. Just a little bit \u2013 I'm not ready to give full \u2013 next year's guidance yet. We will give that when we do our year-end earnings call. But I will tell you based on our preliminary forecasting I do not see that this restating \u2013 restatement having much impact on our growth or margins going forward, so at this time I would suggest you not do anything significant with your models. As I said, we're comfortable with the consensus estimates out there for the fourth quarter. That concludes our opening comments. We're now ready to take questions. Latoya, will you please open the call lines up for questions. Operator : Yes, sir. And the first question is from Peter Heckmann of Avondale. Your line is open. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC : Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for the additional color on the rev rec issues. Kevin, were there any one-time items in the quarter? Any significant term fees or insurance recoveries? Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : There was no insurance recoveries, Pete. There were some one-time term fees and I'm going to have to dig that out. I apologize; I don't have that right at my fingertips. Let's see, yeah, de-conversion fees for the quarter were pretty significant, they were about $9 million. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC : And how did that compare with the prior year? Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Last year, we had $1 million in the quarter. So yeah, it's a pretty significant increase in one-time de-conversion fees this quarter, Pete. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then... Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : And I will tell you that was spread pretty evenly between BP and our electronic payments and quite a bit over and even in the item processing. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC : Okay. Okay. And then we've seen a little bit of an uptick in M&A recently. And I know you have very, very low customer concentration, but any, anything to call out there in terms of M&A that's ongoing that \u2013 wins or losses? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, Pete, it's pretty much same environment that we've been in for quite some time at this point. Nothing noteworthy. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC : Okay. And then just lastly on the payments side, can you break up the individual components of payments that got you that 9% year-over-year increase? Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : I'd \u2013 boy, Pete, I apologize. I don't have that. Let me \u2013 let's take another question, let me research that, and I'll see if I can come back to you. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC : All right. Thanks. Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Thanks, Pete. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is open. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Hey, thanks, guys. And I guess my first question just on the accounting, does this make you guys think about changing the way you do contracts so that you can do individual modules so that you can deliver them recognized right away rather than have multi-deliverables that you can't recognize for several quarters? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Dave, I wish it was that simple. We'd love to do that, but that really would not solve the problem. Part of the process of this evaluation is they look at any contracts that were signed on or about the time of that contract to see if you're doing exactly that, which I think they would perceive as an effort to try to get around the recognition interpretations. So I'll be honest with you, one of my frustrations is I have yet to get a straight answer to the question of what's the appropriate method of handling a situation when we know and the customer knows that there's one of these modules, one or more of these modules that they want to implement on a delayed basis, plan to do it that way from the start. We've yet to get any kind of reasonable guidance as to how to address that problem in an appropriate manner. So unfortunately unbundling the items would not help the situation. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. So does that mean then there will be a permanent kind of bigger deferred revenue, this $172 million number, that's going to always kind of be out there and thus kind of permanently reducing the revenue run rate compared to what we used to have? Is that fair to say? Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : No, I don't think that's a good way to look at it, Dave, because I mean this is a build-up of multiple years that caused this number. I mean, some of these contracts that are in this deferred revenue adjustment are from five years ago because there's one product left to be delivered, and we will systematically go through all those and determine when those are going to be, but eventually that will come down because we'll recognize that revenue. There are some things that we can do in our normal procedures to recognize the revenue sooner, which is why I don't think there's going to be much impact in our revenue growth or our margins moving forward, because some of this is tied to milestones within contracts. It's going to take us four or five years to finally recognize 100% of that revenue. So this $172 million deferred revenue is going to be spread over the next four or five years. And so it's just going to kind of fall in there when it happens. But as that comes down, I think we're going to change our procedures a little bit so we can consistently recognize the revenue that we \u2013 kind of the way we always have, so that $172 million hickey will eventually go down. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And, Dave, on the topic of permanence, you may be aware that FASB has proposed new revenue recognition guidance that was supposed to go into effect in 2017; I think it's been delayed for a year or so at this point. But if the proposed rules were in effect now this whole conversation would not be taking place. Substantially all of this would not be an issue, and we wouldn't even be talking about it, which adds to the challenges with making these. I'm sure there's a pretty good reason why FASB has proposed changes that make this whole conversation unnecessary. Unfortunately, it's not 2017, so we have to deal with it now. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And I guess finally you said you don't see any impact to growth or margins for the fiscal 2016 year, but if revenue growth is lower this year, do you mean that the actual dollars of revenue in our models are acceptable or the growth rate? Just because we're going to have a lower revenue now for fiscal 2015. Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : I think your revenue dollars are probably right, David. I need to go back and confirm that. Like I said, I'm not really ready to give full next year's guidance. But at this point, I think you all are in pretty good shape. I would hate for you to go all change your models and then a couple months from now I come back and say, \"Whoa, wait a minute. We need to revise that.\" So right now I think based on where we ended up this quarter, where I think our forecasting for the fourth quarter and comfortable with that $0.68 consensus, I think next year the growth rate that you all have in there is pretty solid. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): But the growth rate on a different dollar number. I mean if the growth rate's okay that means the dollar number has to be lower. Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Okay. You're right. It should be a little higher growth rate. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay, cool. Well, thanks for all the detail. Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : You bet. Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Tim, please check to see if your line is on mute. Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I'm sorry. Can you hear me now? Operator : Yes, sir. Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I'm sorry. I apologize. Just wanted to talk about maybe the tone of business during the quarter if we could a bit, just any trends that you saw, changes in behavior or priorities, anything around win rates versus loss rates that maybe you could address? If there's just anything to point out there, obviously the quarter was solid so that says something in and of itself, but just any observations you had about the marketplace? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Tim, business as usual. All three brands, Banking, Credit Union, ProfitStars, all of them were over 100% of their sales quote for the quarter and are over 100% on a year-to-date basis. I can't say that there was anything new or different in what customers were looking at or interested in. Again, it's not any one item that they're looking at. Core system sales remain strong. Complementary sales are very solid. Nothing really new in the competitive dynamic than we've seen in the past so it's really just another quarter of business as usual. Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : If I could just ask a follow-up, there's been a lot of attention and probably more to come around cyber-security and all these types of issues. In terms of your solutions, whether the proprietary or partnerships, or how would you, I guess, address that if we saw in the next year or two banks have to really, because of regulatory mandates, pressure from regulators, have to address that? I mean are you positioned from a product front, are these lucrative products for you to help address those issues? Or is that something that would be outside of your scope in terms of services and products? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, no, I would say that for the most part, Tim, it would be within scope. We have a number of solutions that have been gaining traction and we think will continue to, and some of those go back to the Gladiator acquisition that we did in, was that 2005, Tim? And some of the solutions for enterprise security monitoring that we built using that platform and that management team to build out some additional security capabilities, that's been gaining traction. We mentioned that we started July 1 with a new hosted network services offering. Again that's doing well. Again, it's in its infancy but we're seeing good results and good uptake and interest there. I think that will only increase not only as a result of the increased focus of examiners in and around security, but the competition for talent with network and engineering-related backgrounds. So in addition to all the people that we're trying to hire that type of talent before, you've now got the federal government who's trying to beef up their cyber-security infrastructure, I'm sure companies like Target and Home Depot and others that have seen in that business some of the security challenges, they're all beefing up. So in a company like Jack Henry where we are a technology company rated one of the top 100 companies to work for in IT by Computerworld magazine, the challenges we have recruiting technical talent, I can't even imagine what it must be like for a community bank or a credit union who has a staff of two people to be able to recruit that same type of talent. So I think a lot of these factors are going to help drive uptake of some of the solutions like the hosted network services where we can take that server infrastructure and all monitoring, patching, management of those types of services out of the financial institution. So we feel like we're well-positioned with our security solutions as that tension increases. Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much. That's all I had, guys. Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brett Huff of Stephens, Inc. Your line is open. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning, guys. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Good morning, Brett. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: The outsourcing growth was really good at 18%. Anything to \u2013 is that a \u2013 anything to call out there on that number? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Brett, it was solid just from normal business. As Kevin mentioned earlier there was certainly some benefit there from early termination fees, but I think it would have still been 10% or better without any benefit of early termination fees. So it just continues to be a combination of the fact that on the banking side 95% of all of our new deals that we do these days opt for outsourced delivery; that number's probably 60-plus percent year-to-date on the credit union side. We continue to see interest in moving from in-house processing to outsourcing by our existing in-house customers, which as we talked about the revenue uptake that takes place there. So it's just all the factors that have been impacting that business continue to be in place. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: And the second question is on the new offering, and I'm forgetting what you're calling it, you just mentioned it in the last question where you're doing more of the infrastructure outsourcing for banks. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: I think last quarter you all said that early conversation, betas, a few servers of the total server pool at a particular bank might be being tested, et cetera. What's the specific update on those betas? Or do we just have more betas? Or do we have somebody fully outsourcing at this point? Any update on that? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And so just \u2013 we refer to that as Hosted Network Services or HNS as we refer to it around the office. And no, we're well beyond the beta stage at this point, Brett. I think to date we've signed either 13 or 15 customers that are looking to give us some or all of their network infrastructure. It's a combination of both. It's going very well. It is a complex sales cycle. I mean, you're dealing with many, many items in and around complex network related terminology, what products are they running that may or may not be Jack Henry products that we need to bring into our environment if we're going to host that server infrastructure for them. Telecommunications, a lot of factors that enter into that, so it tends to be not an easy short sales cycle just because there's a lot of research that has to be done to make that sale but it's going very well and as expected, it's not just a case of replacing the hardware infrastructures. We're typically finding that they take additional monitoring related services that are higher margin services that improve the overall profitability on the deal. If you look at a typical institution, if they've got 50 servers, the odds are that they didn't buy all 50 of those servers at one time. You know they started out with 10 and they added some products or they needed more capacity. And so they've got this server infrastructure in various stages of its lifecycle. So in some cases it will be less likely that they'll just rip out everything and give us all 50 of those servers at once. They might give us 10 and when the refresh cycle comes up on the next batch give us those. But we're pleased with the, what we're seeing in terms of the contract values and the recurring revenue and the uptake of those solutions at this point. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. And then just last thing. On the refresh status on the various pieces of the cores on real-time. I know some of them are all full real-time now and you're cycling through sort of modules on the other. Can you just give us an update on that? Just there's been a lot of questions that we've gotten on that just given the increased focus on the market just from your competitors. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. So all of those projects, and there are a lot of different projects. I mean, real-time is one of probably 10 different things that might be going on with any product at any given time. But all the projects continue to track well. We're still talking different deliverables for these various projects, Dave (sic) [Brett], that will still extend into the future a number of years. But we're bringing those products to market incrementally as new enhancements are made. Let's for example take real-time that you asked about specifically. We introduced last year, and this is primarily on the SilverLake product because the Episys Credit Union processing system as you know is already fully real-time and has been since its inception; but SilverLake being more of a traditional banking developed system, we're moving it to the real-time operating environment. We released the first set of real-time capabilities last year. In this year's current release, we're extending that further, and sort of the final stages will be wrapped up related to that specific project in next year's release. But substantially the types of capabilities that customers are going to be most interested in related to real-time will be done by the end of this year. But I use that as an example because a number of these, many of these projects that we're working on are large-scale efforts that will be rolled out on an as-available basis, not rolled up into a big bang deployment at some future date. We'll be releasing those changes incrementally as we can make them available. Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Yeah. And let me just say, I mean, banks have never been in big demand for real-time. I mean we're actually doing this proactively because we're still not hearing a big demand for real-time, but we know it's coming with all of the teller branch transformation and everything else that's going on, so we know we need to get there so we're actually being proactive and getting ahead of the game. But, as Jack said, the Episys solution for credit unions, just like most credit union solutions, has been real-time since the 1980s. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And that's a very good point that Kevin made, Brett. I mean I doubt that we have seen a single RFP in the last 12 months on the banking side of the business where the requirement called for a real-time banking system. This is one of those things that we feel like for the next 20 years needs to be in place, and we're working to that end. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: And this is \u2013 I guess the key that I'm getting at is this is just coming out, and as a user of SilverLake I'm just going to get this real-time capability as a matter of course, right? There's no change in my business process, et cetera? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You will get the change as a matter of course. No price changes and frankly no requirement to implement it. If you're perfectly happy with the current method of processing and don't feel that you have a need for real-time, you will not be required and we won't flip a switch and now everything's processing real-time. It'll be up to the bank whether they do it that way or not, or \u2013 but the point is if they wake up five years from now and decide, oh wow, this real-time thing has become important, it'll be ready when they are. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Great. That's what I needed. Thank you. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Thanks, Brett. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. Just a number of clarifications on the restatement to begin with, because I'm \u2013 we're getting a lot of questions; I know a lot of people are confused. But just to level set us all, for fiscal 2015, just to be clear, it sounds like you're talking $252-ish million all in, given the year-to-date restated numbers and, Kevin, you sort of talked about $0.68 for the fourth quarter. So just to make sure that's sort of what we're thinking about for fiscal 2015. And then I'll follow up related to 2016. Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Yes. Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. So 2016 now, following up on David Koning's questions consensus is directionally $290 million. So that would be sort 15% or so EPS growth, or 18% if you backed out the term fee grow-over from this quarter. And I think what David was trying to get at is your revenue base is something like $50 million to $55 million lower on a full-year basis, but you're sort of implying your growth rate will be stronger going into next year. I don't know if that's due to the restatement or some other sort of core factor. And then on an absolute basis our revenue numbers and EPS numbers are kind of in the ballpark? Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Glenn, actually I made myself a note that if I didn't get questioned I was going to go back and clarify that exact point. Because after I said that I actually got an IM from my Controller and she slapped my hand. So the revenue growth is going to be consistent with about the way it was this year, so it is off a lower base. So the revenue numbers do need to come down next year because of this restatement. So the growth next year should still be in the mid to high single digits but it is going to be off a lower revenue base. Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): And what, or how should we think about the margin implications? And if we step down, I don't know $0.15 this year because of the restatement or whatever the number is, is that the new base that we grow off of at sort of the 10% to 15% rate? Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Yes. But your margins, like I said, the margins should stay pretty solid. I mean, so the margins for the fourth quarter, it looks to be on a forecast looks to be right at the 43% gross margin that we would have before restatement. Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then the \u2013 just think about this $172 million increase in deferred revenue which I think you said gets recognized over four to five years. Does that unto itself have any impact on the growth rate? Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : I mean, it could, Glenn. But we need to take $172 million and divide it by $8 billion or whatever over the next five years, could it have an impact? Maybe, but I think the only impact you might see would be in a quarter. Any significant increase would be in a quarter where we have, you know some large deal that we install and we had to defer 100% of the revenue and we finally ship that last piece of software and it gets recognized 100% of the revenue in that quarter. But I think on a year-over-year basis, could it enhance growth a little bit? Yes, maybe, but I don't think it's going to be material enough to see. And like I said, once we layer that all out and have a chance to go back and analyze all that, on the year-end guidance I'll be able to give you a whole lot better feel for what that is \u2013 not only for year-over-year growth for FY 2016 but also kind of on a quarterly basis. Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then the term fee was pretty unusual for you, was there just sort of one sort of call out? Or I guess I'm sort of thinking about the implications on a go-forward revenue basis related to that term fee. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Glenn, I don't know that there was any one item that was particularly noteworthy, it's just the way some acquisitions or de-conversions fell. Nothing stands out as being noteworthy. Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): And on a similar point I think Pete Heckmann was asking these questions too related to bank M&A, Fiserv alluded to sort of a takeaway win recently I think via DNA. And Fidelity at their Analyst Day on Monday was actually alluding to a pretty significant takeaway as well. Are those \u2013 is that accurate? And does that have implications for fiscal 2016 growth? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : First of all, yes, it's accurate; and no, it has no noteworthy impact. You might also recall, Glenn, if you've looked at our press releases there was the Shell Oil Credit Union replacement which was a replacement of DNA, which that was either our seventh or eighth replacement of DNA. So yeah, do they occasionally take a deal away from us? Yeah. Do we take considerably more deals from them than they take from us? Yeah. Related to the CIT I believe is probably the bank... Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yup. That's it. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That you're referring to that will be de-converting. So CIT is a large bank in terms of assets, but they're very much an unusual bank if you will. They're an online only bank, deal primarily with certificates of deposit, so their asset size is much larger than their account volumes would dictate. And in that particular transaction the bank that they're acquiring which is OneWest has over 100 branches versus no branches at CIT Bank. CIT, we are the back room for CIT's operations versus a fully staffed and built out back room that OneWest has. And I believe I'm correct in saying that OneWest is a fairly recent consolidation of about three different banks that have gone through a series of core system conversions and are probably just settling in from that. So the dynamic you're left with is we can take the relatively small CIT operation with no branches and minimal staff that has to be retrained, or we can take the 100-plus branches of OneWest, hundreds and hundreds of employees that would have to be retrained and who have just recently been retrained from whatever they just converted from to be distilled into the current organization that they are today. So we knew we had long odds of being able to retain that business going in. It was not a product-related issue; as a matter of fact I suspect that our competitor will probably have to do some product enhancement just to deliver some of the capabilities that were already being delivered to CIT. But yeah, certainly hate to lose any customer. The M&A world introduces opportunities and we win \u2013 we're the victor in a lot of those, and sometimes it goes the other way. Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Very helpful. Thanks for clarifying. Operator : Thank you. We have a follow-up question from Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is open. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Hey, guys. I don't know if this would be possible, but if you have Q1 and Q2 restated numbers too, just so we can get our models set for all the quarters? Or do you just have the year-to-date and Q3? Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : I do not have those at my finger-tips, Dave, but what I think I can do and I'll have to also make sure I can do this per SEC Counsel, but what I might do is be able to put those out on our JHA website. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah... Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : And that way, and once I put them out there then if I can do that, then I would also be able to just e-mail them to you all to put in your models. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : So let me confirm. I'm actually going to feed in here in just a few minutes. We're actually here meeting for a quarterly board meeting for the next two days. I'll run that by him and make sure he is okay with that. And if he is, then we will put something out there. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's good. And then just one other question; are there going to be lumpy quarters when certain \u2013 elements come on? Is it going to create some lumpiness that goes up a lot in one quarter and then comes back down? Or when new big projects go into \u2013 does that create a lumpy growth, but then it stabilizes from there just given once the revenue is installed, then it just kind of stabilizes? I'm just wondering if there is going to be increased lumpiness or not really? Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Well I think there is going to be some increased lumpiness, Dave, but I think what we are going to see, and what we've seen, is we've kind of gone back and looked at the impact for the last five years is, it's kind of more heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. Because like I've said, we have to wait until the, actually the last product is installed, and then we take 100% of that revenue and we recognize that revenue ratably over the remainder of that maintenance contract period, which is until June 30. So throughout the year as we continue to make that final installation, then that's just going to snowball. So any revenue recognized from this deferral is actually going to trend up from Q1 to Q4. So there will be \u2013 the recent \u2013 a little lumpiness but that's really what's going to be the driver that's actually going to increase the revenue from Q1 to Q4. And once we get that all layered out and kind of dissected, Dave, I'll try to give better guidance on our next earnings call of what that will be. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. No, that's helpful. Thank you. Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : You bet. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over for closing remarks. Kevin D. Williams - CFO, Treasurer & Head- Investor Relations : Thanks, Latoya. Again, we want to thank you all for joining us today to review our third quarter fiscal 2015 results. We're pleased with the results from our ongoing operations and the efforts of all of our associates to take care of our customers. We're looking forward to finalizing this detailed revenue recognition review and getting current with our SEC filings. But as Jack mentioned in the opening, despite these efforts our executives, managers and all of our associates have continued to focus on what is best for our customers and our shareholders. With that, I want to thank you again; and Latoya will you please provide the replay number? Operator : Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, the replay number for this call will be 1-800-585-8367. And the passcode is 33663566. And once again that number is 1-800-585-8367. The passcode is 33663566. That concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jack. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Kevin. Good morning and welcome to the call. We are pleased to again announce the record revenue and earnings for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2015. We had another strong financial performance and returned over $199 million in cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In spite of being blacked out of trading for over half the fiscal year, we continued to receive strong satisfaction ratings from our employees and our customers throughout the year, measurements that we consider important to assure we do the right thing for all of our major constituent groups. Our sales teams continued their strong performances, and for the fifth consecutive year, all of our brands, Jack Henry Banking, Symitar, and ProfitStars finished ahead of their sales targets for the year. Our Baking team saw a balanced performance of core and complementary product sales. Symitar was once again the credit union industry leader in new name core system sales. ProfitStars, again, had strong cross-sales to its non-core customer base of almost 9,000 institutions with over half of their product sales to non-JHA core customers. Our payments products had strong sales and transaction growth throughout the year and corresponding revenue grew 9% for the year. Revenue growth remains strong at 6% in the quarter and 7% for the year even with the revenue recognition challenges we addressed during the year. OutLink and cloud revenue and payments growth for the year at 15% and 9% respectively were among the larger contributors to this growth. We saw improvement in operating margins in the quarter and year-to-date even with the impact of bundling our license fees implementation services and maintenance on multi-element contracts. Because of the additional audit-related time required to address the revenue recognition issues earlier in the year, the start of the year-end audit process was somewhat delayed. Although, our staff and our outside audit firm are working hard to complete the year-end audit, this late start is likely to cause another short delay in our year-end SEC filings due to the time needed to finish their audit procedures. If that delay should become necessary, we will file the appropriate Form 12b-25 with the SEC and we are confident that our auditors will be finished so that we can file our Form 10-K within the 15-day grace period provided by that filing. Again, it was a solid performance for the year and we look forward to a new year without some of these distractions. As I turn it over to Kevin for a closer look at the financials, I'd like to express our appreciation to our over 11,000 customers for their continued business and our over 5,900 associates who continue to take care of those customers every day. Kevin? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thanks, Jack. With the change in revenue recognition, obviously our license revenues reported is now clearly immaterial as it represents less than 1% of our total revenue. Remember that the vast majority of what used to be considered license revenue is now included in with bundled services which is included in our support and service line of revenue. Our support and service line of revenue continues to drive our total revenue growth and it increased to $318.6 million, which is a 6% increase over the same quarter a year ago and represents 95% of our total revenue. Both the year this line of revenue increased 8% to $1.201 billion this year from $1.112 billion a year ago, solid growth in our support and services which basically had contributions for the year from all the lines within support and services. For the quarter, implementation services were down slightly to $18 million from $18.3 million. Our electronic payments was up nicely 7% for the quarter to $121.4 million from $113.9 million same quarter year ago. OutLink was up 14% for the quarter to $69.7 million. In-house maintenance was down slightly to $76.2 million and bundled services which again is the items related to multi-element contracts was up 11% for the quarter to $33.4 million this year versus $30.1 million last year. As I said, all the components were up nicely for the year. Implementation was up 13% to $74.8 million. Our electronic payments business was up 9% to $481.6 million. OutLink was up 15% to $269.4 million. In-house maintenance was up slightly 1% to $311.9 million and the bundled services was up 4% to $62.9 million from $60.7 million last year. Our hardware decreased 2% for the quarter to $14 million from $14.2 million last year. And for the year, hardware decreased 10% to $52.9 million from $58.7 million. As we've talked about for several quarters, hardware will continue to become a smaller number and a smaller percentage of our total revenue. Our consolidated gross margins improved to 44% for the quarter compared to 43% in last year's fourth quarter. License margins increased to 83% from 74%. Support and service margins improved to 45% from 44% for the quarter and hardware margins also improved to 27%. For the year, our gross margins improved to 43% from 42% last fiscal year. License margins decreased slightly from 58% down to 55%. Remember, the large percentage of this license revenue now called licenses third-party software that we are reselling, which is why the margins looked lower than they have historically. Our support and service margins were steady at 43% for both fiscal years and our hardware margins improved slightly to 27% from 25% a year ago due to sales mix. Our total operating expenses increased 7% for the quarter and 6% for the full fiscal year compared to year ago periods. Operating margin for the quarter increased to 27% compared to 26% a year ago, and for the year remained level at 25% for both fiscal years. The effective tax rate for the quarter decreased to 32.0% because this is the last quarter that we get the benefit of the R&E credit and we also had some favorable state law tax changes that impacted the quarter which caused this lower effective tax rate for the quarter, which compared to 36.4% in the fourth quarter last year. And for the year, our effective tax rate was 33.3% compared to 35.1% for the full year last year. Obviously, the current year lower tax rate contributed nicely to our net income and EPS. As pre-tax income was up 10% for the year and our taxes only increased 4% in relation to that. This decrease in our effective tax rate for the year was primarily due to the R&E tax credit which is now once again expired. Our EPS of $0.75 was up 20% over last year's EPS of $0.62 for the quarter and full year EPS was $2.59, or a 18% increase over last year. EBITDA for the year increased to $437 million compared to $420.1 million last year. Depreciation and amortization expense of $119 million with $54.2 million in depreciation and $64.8 million in amortization compared to $107.8 million in D&A last year. Included in the total amortization is the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions which is down slightly to $20.0 million compared to $21.2 million a year ago. Operating cash flows was up $32.1 million or 9.4% to $373.8 million for the year. As we continue to invest in our company both through CapEx and cap software our new and existing products and we continue to return to our shareholders through dividends. We also purchased 150,000 shares for the treasury in the fourth quarter, and we purchased a little over 2 million shares for the fiscal year. For FY 2016 guidance, our total revenues projected to grow for FY 2016 in the up or mid-single-digits similar to the last couple of years, are in the 6% to 7% range, even considering the anticipated headwinds from lower early termination fees that we experienced in FY 2015. I do want to highlight the change in our revenue flow under the new revenue recognition method which has ratably recognized revenue from the bundling of license, implementation and PCS or maintenance from the date of last installed product, which grows in compounds throughout the year. If you look at the last three years, average bundling for the three years grew from 2% of total revenue in the first quarter to an average of 10% of total revenue in the fourth quarter which just also impacts the operating margin as the average operating margin grew from an average of 23.4% in the first quarter to an average of 26.5% in the fourth quarter on average for the last three respective years. This needs to be considered for your models and quarterly estimates as that flow of bundling and margins will continue for the foreseeable future. With some slight leverage, our operating income and operating cash flows should both continue to outpace the revenue growth similar to this year. However, our effective tax rate as I mentioned for FY 2016 is projected to be 36%, which is up from the 33.3% this year. Since we cannot assume that the R&E credit or the other benefits received this year will be reinstated or repeated, which, not to point out the obvious, that this difference in tax rate would have been approximately $0.10 impact on EPS for FY 2015, if we would have at the higher rate, which obviously just creates a very tough comparable and headwind for next year. This increase in tax rate will most likely more than offset any positive impact of stock repurchase during the year. Therefore, some margin improvement offset by the impact of the increased effective tax rates, we should see an EPS growth slightly ahead of our projected revenue growth for the fiscal year, which this is below the current consensus estimate for FY 2016 which we need to have adjusted accordingly. Obviously if the R&E credit is reinstated, then we will revise our guidance accordingly. At this time, we believe that if we are able to buy back the 2 million to 3 million shares we planned of stock for the treasury subject to the NASDAQ trading limit during the year to help offset this tax increase, that our full fiscal year 2016 EPS will be in the range of $2.74 to $2.78 which adjusted for the tax rate on an apples-to-apples basis would still be a 10% to 12% increase in EPS. Remember that due to the bundling of services, this will be backend loaded. That concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions. Stephanie, will you please open the call line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Thank you. Good morning, Jack and Kevin. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Good morning. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Morning. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Could you elaborate a little bit on demand trends? Give us a better sense of what your customers' spending intentions are for the year ahead, let's say, for core processing and for payments? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, David. Yeah, I think generally speaking, the demand trends remain solid and consistent. I don't know that there's any particular spikes or areas that they're looking to significantly increase spending. Core is going to be, I think, a steady progression in line with what we have seen, similarly with payments; but again the environment, I think, has continued to improve. And at some point, interest rates will get raised and given some time to adjust balance sheets following that raise, I think that bodes well for earnings for financial institutions, and again, I think that certainly holds well. I think it's likely that there will be increased focus on security-related spending. Just general environment, as regards security plus, I believe the regulatory agencies are probably going to put more of an emphasis on that in the not too distant future. So, certain product offerings there could benefit from that increased scrutiny. But beyond that, and that potential uplift, I think most of it is pretty consistent with what we've been seeing. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Understood. And then you highlighted 7% growth in electronic payments in the quarter. About a year and a half ago, electronic payments was growing in the mid to high-teens. Can you just walk us through some of the underlying demand drivers behind electronic payments? What are the key trends you're seeing in that line item? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, depending on exactly what was going on in the period that you're comparing us to. We had, for example, one large bill payment conversion that consisted of, I want to say I think it was about 800 small to medium sized credit unions that came across in that transaction, so that's probably about the timeframe that you might have saw that considerably larger. But you're seeing a modest growth in most of your traditional payment areas, like electronic bill payment and ATM debit card transaction processing, higher growth rates in some of your mobile payment offerings. So I think that there's certainly increased emphasis in spending related to mobile. Although, compared to the more established payment method, that's still a very small percentage of total payments related revenue, but that certainly is the area where most of the growth is. And while our growth rates for debit card and electronic bill payment are generally above the industry averages, there's still going to be more moderate growth rates than what we're seeing in the mobile area. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Understood. And just a couple of quick housekeeping questions. Kevin, you mentioned contract term fees. What were contract term fees in the fourth fiscal quarter versus the year earlier quarter and how should we think about term fees in the year ahead? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah, David. Term fees for the quarter were actually almost $5 million number which were up from about $4.2 million for the same quarter a year ago. Our term fees for the year as we've talked about throughout the year were up significantly. I'm trying to find the number. For the year, our term fees were actually about $26 million, up from $13 million a year ago. We think that this next year, those term fees are going to go back down more in line with where they were in probably 2014, maybe not quite that low. But we don't foresee another year near as high as this year. So, for the quarter, we were up about $800,000 versus a year ago. For the year, it was up significantly over FY 2014. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Got it. And then do you have a software cap forecast for 2016, both external and then software cap for internal use? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Software cap, David, for next year is going to be pretty, pretty level with where we ended up this year. We've pretty got everything in line. I mean, it's obviously going to bounce around a little bit, but a lot of the projects are continuing to go right along. So we're probably going to be in the $78 million or maybe even right at $80 million cap software next year. For internal software, it should probably right in line, somewhere in the $14 million to $15 million range for FY 2016. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Great. And then just finally, do you have a June 30th share count? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : I do not have that in front of me, David. I'm sorry. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is open. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Hey, guys. Nice job. And I guess my first question, just, the bundled services line I get the seasonal progression. But the last couple of years, it was about double. So up about 100% sequentially from Q3 to Q4, and I get that this year though it was up by 150% sequentially, so like 2.5 times instead of double. So that's an extra, whatever that is, that $4 million or $5 million maybe, relative to what it would have been if the historical pattern kind of held up. But I don't know, is there a historical pattern to fully bake in or can that just move around $4 million, $5 million, $6 million a quarter and it's just a little tough to forecast. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It is tough to forecast. It's going to bounce around. And obviously, this depends on the last product within a multi-element contract that gets delivered, the timing of that, the size of the contract. So if you have a quarter where you have the last element of a whole bunch of small contracts put in place versus quarter where you had the last element of some large core implementations goes with that, that's going to fluctuate significantly. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And that is higher margin, right? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It is a little higher margin than our traditional core margin, yes. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then also, you made what looked like a really small acquisition, I think July 1. How much about revenue do you expect from that this year? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah. Dave, it's going to be a pretty small contributor to revenue. As you may recall with the Goldleaf acquisition we did a number of years ago, we picked up accounts receivable financing business. The base of that acquisition that you're referring to really kind of rounds that offering out nicely with additional asset-based lending capabilities, factoring, inventory, and asset lending. There's no overlap in the offerings of the two. They didn't do what we did with our lending solutions business and we didn't do what they did with their business. So, it brought us a number of new customers, a very nice fit, good cross-sell opportunities of both products between both bases. We've consolidated that in and we think there's some nice leverage and some good uptake opportunities, but it's pretty small, probably on the order of $5 million to $6 million in revenue. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, David... David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : ... the total purchase price was $10 million. So it is a very small acquisition. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Cool. And then I guess just the last one. Normally, term fees are lower, like you said. Is it big enough to clients that left this year and gave you the term fees that it makes up a mild impact on revenue? I know normally it really has no impact, but was this enough that you can actually feel like 0.5% impact to revenue this year because of those that left, or is it not near that much? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : I don't think you're going to feel it, Dave. I mean, because it's kind of just kind of baked in our normal operations \u2013 I mean, yeah it was higher and it gives us a little more headwinds to have to grow over, but it is what it is. And we kind of budget for the loss of those within us, so it's baked into the guidance that we're given. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I meant it more from a standpoint of did the \u2013 like, I understand the term fee is jumping around a little bit, but the actual normal revenue stream of the clients that went away, that's not an overly big number probably? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. I mean, we hate to ever lose a customer, Dave, and obviously you got to go and replace that revenue when that happens. But I think if you really look at the total revenue generated even by the larger customers, on an annual basis, it's not going to be a significant issue. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Good. Well, thank you. Good job. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Dave. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thanks, Dave. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens. Your line is open. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Morning, Brett. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Kevin, you mentioned a little bit that the project you guys have been working on are going to continue for a little while. Can you just enumerate those for us again, kind of the big chunks, so we can make sure to kind of keep track of those? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Well, Brett, so some of the larger projects, we've got a significant redevelopment effort on our core or primary credit union offering on the Symitar side. We've done a number of things on the Banking side for not so much an architectural change, as much as some efficiency enabling capabilities that we're bringing to the customer base. Those are probably farther along, or closer to completion. We're still continuing on a multi-year effort on the credit union development side. All of those are going very well. The thing to keep in mind though Dave (sic) [Brett], is even as these projects begin to roll off, other projects are going to come up. I mean, when you've been in the business for 38 years and you've got couple of hundred products out there, something is always going be in need of a refresh, if not a very significant revamping of the offering. So those are some of the larger transactions, but we've got payments related development efforts, other related efforts that are probably ramping up as some of these begin to ramp down. So, I don't look for any dramatic changes in that area in the near-term. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, can you give us an update on the selling process or the demand for the new product where you're helping folks outsource sort of their non-application servers, where you're helping the e-mail servers and things like that. I know that was something you've all been working on. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. It's going very well, Dave (sic) [Brett]. We've officially kind of launched that offering at the start of the fiscal year. We've got probably around 25 customers at this point that have elected to hand us some or all of their server-related offerings to manage for them. We're very pleased with that. It's a nice contributor to recurring revenue. Last fiscal year or this next fiscal year, it's not going to be a meaningful number that shows up. But again, it's a nice contributor to recurring revenue and it will tend to compound over time. So, I think it's a timely offering. It's been well received in the market. It is not a simple sale. You're dealing with networks and infrastructure and telecommunications and a lot of things that require some engineering talent to be able to go in and assess properly in order to do a proposal. So it's not a simple sale and some of the sales cycles tend to be a little bit longer. But again, I think with some of the growing emphasis that we are seeing and are going to see even more in the future related to cyber security threats, I think there's going to be increasing interest and reasons for financial institutions to look at this type of an offering. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And then last question from me. You mentioned that you thought the security, compliance and fraud would be a driver this year. Can you give us a rough idea of how much revenue was in that bucket? And I guess, security, compliance and fraud are the three main pieces or how do you parse it that you might be able to give us a ballpark percentage? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Brett, I mean that's revenue that goes into so many different buckets. It's hard to pull them all out and say, yeah, this is what's related to security and fraud because we've got so many different products within Banking, Symitar and ProfitStars that deal with those in various ways that I've never taken the time to try to put it all into one bucket. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's what I needed. Thanks, guys. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah. Thanks, Brett. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Kevin Williams for closing remarks. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Okay. Thanks, Stephanie. Again, we want to thank you for joining us today to review our fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2015 results. We are very pleased with the results from our ongoing operations and the efforts of all our associates to take care of our customers. Our executives, managers and all of our associates continue to focus on what is best for our customers and our shareholders. With that, I want to thank you again and, Stephanie, will you please provide the replay number? Operator : Thank you. This call will be available for replay after 11 :45 A.M. today through August 28, 2015 at 11 :59 P.M. You may access the replay by dialing 800-585-8367 or 404-537-3406, and entering access code 8190584. That does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect and everyone, have a great day.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Kevin Williams. Sir you may begin. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us for the Jack Henry & Associates first quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO; and on the call with me today is Jack Prim, our CEO. The agenda for the call this morning is Jack will start with some his thoughts about the business and the performance of the quarter, then I will provide some additional comments regarding the press release and the earnings we put out yesterday after the market closed, and then as normal we will open the lines up for Q&A. I need to remind you that remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jack. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Kevin. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2016. We are pleased to again be able to report a solid performance for the quarter. Revenue growth was strong at 7% although direct year-over-year comparisons to specific revenue components, especially license fees, are less meaningful due to the prior-period restatements and new revenue recognition procedures. Perhaps the most noteworthy takeaway regarding revenue is that license fees now have a minimal impact on our revenue, making up less than 1% of the total in the last quarter, while our largest revenue category, support and services, represented 96%, and recurring revenue represented 83% of the total. Outsourcing and payments again showed strong growth as did in-house maintenance based primarily on new credit union core system implementations even with the continued movement of existing in-house customers to outsourcing. We held our annual banking and credit union user conferences in the quarter and had record combined attendance with over 2,200 bank and credit union executives in attendance, including representatives from 30 prospective core customers. Customers were excited to see the progress on our various core product enhancement initiatives and the influence of the recently acquired Banno team on our mobile and electronic delivery channel solutions. They were also appreciative that the new TILA-RESPA regulatory changes related to mortgage loan disclosures were delivered on time for all JHA systems for the required October implementation date. This was a massive development and deployment initiative that had to be delivered on a very short timeline. Our sales team finished the quarter right at 100% of sales plans. Pipelines look solid and combined with the user sentiment at the conferences we look forward to continued progress. With that I'll turn it over to Kevin for a closer look at the numbers. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thanks, Jack. As Jack mentioned with the change in revenue recognition our license revenue as reported is now clearly immaterial as it represents less than 1% of our revenue. Remember that the vast majority of what used to be considered license revenue is now included in the bundled services, which is included in the support and services line of revenue. Support and services line of revenue continues to drive our total revenue growth as it increased to $307.7 million, which is a 7% increase over the same quarter a year ago of $288.2 million, and again represented, 96% of our total revenue in both years. Support and services breakdown for the quarter compared to the prior year \u2013 implementation services of $17.1 million compared to $18.6 million was a decrease of 8% for the quarter compared to a year ago. Our electronic payments was $126.5 million compared to $119.4 million, which is an increase of 6% for the quarter. OutLink which is our \u2013 OutLink data services was $70.7 million compared to $63.1 million or a 12% increase for the quarter, pretty much in line with what we did last fiscal year. Our in-house maintenance was $84.3 million versus $80 million, or an increase of 5%, and bundled services was up slightly to $9.1 million versus $7.2 million last year. Our hardware decreased 4% for the quarter to $12.3 million from $12.8 million last year. Our consolidated gross margins improved to 43% for the quarter compared to 42% in last year's fiscal year. License margins were 89% for the quarter. Support and service margins were steady at 43% compared to prior year quarter and our hardware margins improved slightly to 29%, from 26% a year ago due to sales mix. Our total operating expenses increased 4% for the quarter compared to a year ago and our operating margin for the quarter increased slightly to 25% compared to 24% a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter increased to 36.1% from 35.5% the first quarter year-ago, which this increase primarily was due to an increase in effective state rate for the quarter compared to a year ago. Net income was up 11% to $1.4 million, which led to EPS of $0.64 per share, which was up 14% over last year's EPS of $0.56. EBITDA for the year to date increased to $111.9 million compared to $101.1 million last year, or an 11% increase, right in line with net income growth. Depreciation and amortization expense of $31.2 million with $13 million in depreciation and $18.2 million in amortization compared to $29.5 million last year. Included in total amortization is the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions which is down slightly to $4.8 million compared to $5.4 million a year ago. Operating cash flows were up $33.5 million to 36% \u2013 or a 36% increase to $126.7 million for the year to date, primarily due to the timing of collections of our annual maintenance billings. We continue to invest in our company both through CapEx and cap software on new and existing products and we continue to return to our shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. Our return on equity for the trailing 12 months is right at 23% return. We also purchased just over 1 million shares for the treasury in the first quarter. As far as guidance, our guidance has not changed from that that we gave at the beginning of the year on the last call. Revenue is still projected to grow in the upper mid-single-digits for the year. But remember to consider the impact of the revenue and margins for the quarter is due to the change in the revenue recognition and the impact of bundling services, which drove the compound revenue during the year, impacting the total revenue and margins in each of the quarters. We continue to anticipate a slight leverage on operating margin for the year. However, remember the projected effective tax rate for FY 2016 is 36%, up from 33% last year, since we still can assume that the R&E credit will be reinstated or repeated. This increase in tax rate will be mostly offset by any positive impact on stock purchase during the year. Obviously if the R&E credit is repeated then we will revise our guidance accordingly. Also I would like to remind you for the second fiscal quarter that we end now, last year had a one time-gain on sales from assets that came from the Goldleaf acquisition. Combine that with the effective tax rate in our second quarter last year was 32%, compared to the expected 36% for this year, and adjusting for just those tow items an apples-to-apples basis, we would have reported $0.60 EPS last year against the current consensus estimate of $0.68 this year, which is probably a little aggressive. Also considering we had a couple of pennies' positive EPS impact in the first quarter this year that we anticipated to happen in the second quarter from term fees which are total term fees for the quarter was $7 million this quarter compared to 5 million last year. That concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions. Juliana, will you please open the call lines up for questions? Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. Could you just sort of help delineate the very, very strong growth and margins on the credit union business and were the term fees part of that? And conversely the banking business looked a little bit soft, and then I had a couple of follow-ups. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Glenn, I think primarily the credit union numbers are just a result of we had some \u2013 several, very strong sales years. I think in the fiscal year we implemented six credit unions there were $1 billion and assets so we continue to have good momentum. I think the credit union progress was one of the reasons that you saw our software maintenance numbers grow even though again we continue to see a steady progression of existing in-house customers moving to outsourcing. So I think it's just basic fundamental business on the credit union side that's continued to grow. Do you have anything you'd add to that? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yes, other thing I would add, Glenn, is part of it is impacted a little bit by the bundling of services which just comes down to kind of the timing of delivery of the last products that we have talked about in the last couple of calls. So it had a nice impact on that which the opposite happened to the banking. The bundling services for banking was down about $2.5 million and the bundling for services for credit unions is up is a little, $4 million. But even if you back that out our credit union revenue growth was still a little over 15%, but still extremely solid growth on a year-over-year basis. Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): And if you think about it for the year, sort of talk about the revenue growth of the upper mid single digits, how would you sort of so we know the deal with accounting for the bundling services, on a full year basis how would you think about the growth for credit union versus banking? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : I think credit union is going to outpace banking by little bit but the timing of billing sources is just hard to predict, Glenn. It is what it is, just comes down to when that last product is delivered and it's tough to anticipate what impact that's going to be. I stand behind the guidance of our revenue in the mid \u2013 upper mid single digits, and credit unions is going to outpace banking just a little bit. Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, then... John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I wouldn't think that certainly, Glenn, that it would be at a 15% in apples-to-apples growth rate rest of the world. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : No, absolutely no. Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay and then the bigger picture question, maybe just broadly the spending trend you are seeing, the booking trend you had in the quarter and pipeline going forward and one of your peers talked about somewhat slowdown in discretionary spending maybe from bigger banks but have you seen anything like that? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We have not, Glenn. Again, as I mentioned the sales team were right at 100% and they just finished their fifth consecutive year of all three brands making \u2013 obtaining 100% of their assigned quota and this is usually a pretty challenging quarter, as first quarter of our fiscal year. So there is a certain amount of rushing to close everything if you can in the fourth quarter but \u2013 so to come up with 100% performance in Q1 is certainly I think a good sign. I think the other thing is that the pipelines were up not only compared to where they were a year ago, they were also up compared to where we were at the start of the fourth quarter. So to be up after again that big push in Q4 is a little unusual, and it won't \u2013 again it went up a tremendous amount but I would have been happy with flat. So I think generally the fundamentals look pretty solid at this point. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : The other thing to remember, Glenn, is Jack mentioned the two user education conference we just had for JHA Banking and Symitar. We had record attendance at the Symitar meeting. We had close to record attendance on the banking side, it was the highest in years, actually the highest I believe since the recession. And the number of prospects that we had at both the user meetings was close to record. So that is always a good indication when people are willing to send their people to an education conference to get more exposure to our product, that's always a good thing for us to come out of there, and also to have a large number of prospects attend both of those. Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): And then just a final one and I'll jump back in the queue, but do you guys have any impact from any big bank M&A that's been announced? I mean there has been a couple of notable ones, but I don't know if you were on either side of those equations? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, nothing new, Glenn. The ones that I've seen in the last several months are \u2013 I mean certainly we have some banks that are involved with M&A but we talked about Susquehanna, we talked about CIT (14:04) a year or so ago. But certainly... Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): So nothing like First Niagara, KeyBank, any of those kind of things? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, none of those are impactable to us. Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Willi from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, thanks, good morning. I apologize, since I'm talking here a bit late. So if I ask something that was covered just tell me to take it offline. But could you talk a bit about just sort of again the whole network hosting solution that you guys have rolled out? And I know you've just got a handful of customer there. But any color around interest levels or anything along that nature and then also just I know it's a multi-year type of outlook, but maybe you could just talk a bit about the scalability of that, if momentum builds and it takes off? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah Tim, we are continuing to see strong interest there, number of implementations are growing. It's going to be a compounding effect before that comes in meaningful revenue line item, but we are seeing good growth. I would tell you that thus far year to date, in terms of the number of units, number of institutions that we had expected from (15:28) behind what we thought we would be but actually the size some of the institutions has been larger than we expected it would be. So if you look at the sales margin dollars that we expected to book, we are actually ahead of where we expected to be even though the number of actual units, number of actual financial institutions is less than we thought that it might be at this point. But we see very good interest. There was a lot of discussion around those topics at the user conference. The emphasis on regulatory agencies, on cyber security is continuing to ramp up and that's, again, we think going to be a tailwind for this type of service. So again probably a little \u2013 a year or two away from this becoming a noteworthy line item in terms of how it shows up in the financials but we're very pleased with where it is at this point. Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. And then just on capital, and again, if you hit on this in Glenn's questions I missed it, I apologize. But just any thoughts around how the M&A environment looks like? I mean it looks like in the tech world lots of \u2013 it seems like people are trying to scramble for exits of sales, there's maybe talk of the cost of capital going up and the valuations in the marketplace obviously continuing to expand. Have you seen any change around books coming across your desks and/or seller valuations continuing to stretch out, are they starting to flatten out in terms of what they are looking for versus a year ago? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We have not seen any change in expectations of what properties should sell for, Tim. I think deal flow books coming across our desk, nothing noteworthy to mention there. We don't take the approach of let's just bolt on revenue and buy something just because it's available for sale et cetera. If it's a good strategic fit, if it fits with our sales distribution channel, if it's a product that that is something our customers need and we can leverage it through those channels, then certainly we would give it a look. But most of what we are seeing continues not to meet those guidelines and frankly the few that we have seen in recent history that did fall into those guidelines, the other challenge there was the expectation around selling price. And I don't know that has moderated yet. Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then... Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Having said that, Tim, we have an untapped credit facility that we would love to find the right acquisition. So we will continue to look for them. Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes, no, obviously you guys have a great balance sheet versus the industry, which is not in bad shape, but you obviously are about as pristine as it gets right now. Just a last one and I'll hop off. In the payment business and sort of tying into EMV and I guess more broadly security, I mean we do hear a lot around the payments companies finding some uptick in not just EMV revenue which might be sort of transitory but also just enhanced security around their payment business, their payment cards et cetera. Are you seeing any of that? Is that something that's picked up or do you think that could pick up in that payment business? I don't know if it would be in that line item or a different line item, but just any thoughts there? Thanks. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Tim, the EMV numbers \u2013 there is \u2013 first of all we are not in the card production business. So there is no card production or no meaningful card production revenue. I mean, we work with outside card manufacturers and while there may be a little bit of a market there, it's not a meaningful number, so from the EMV card production, nothing there. There may be some very slight upticks in some of the processing fees around EMV. But again I don't think that it would be noteworthy. Security \u2013 for your basic payment processing businesses, I think it's difficult to get paid more for security. I mean I think the kind of security product that we get potentially paid additional for would be like a hosted network services or some of the monitoring intrusion prevention services that we offer to our customers. Our customers had always expected that their payments are processed securely. And that I don't think they are willing to pay us anything else, for something they already expect to be included. If anything, I would tell you that we continue to invest significant amounts of money in and around the security area to make sure in fact that we do deliver on that expectation that our customers have. So other than the security-related products and services that we've offered for some time, I don't know that I see a lot of upside in terms of existing businesses based on security considerations. Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great, thanks very much. That's all I had. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Hi, Good morning Kevin and Jack. Hey, Kevin, as you \u2013 as I listen in your comments and you talk about the second quarter and based on you saying maybe a couple of pennies pulled into the first quarter, would you expect year-over-year growth or is that going to be difficult considering the tough comparisons you have and kind of what happened in the first quarter? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : I think it's going to be tough to have much, if any, growth, Kartik. I think if I was going to guide you to something I'd probably guide you to basically flat with last year. And then like I said all along, with the billing service, everything, our year is going to be more backend-loaded than you all are historically used to. So we are anticipating a very sizable fourth quarter. So second quarter is not going to be much, if any, growth. Obviously if Congress puts the R&E credit in before December 31 then all bets are off because then that changes the effective tax rate considerably and then obviously we would have growth but that's about the only way I can see that happening. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : And Kevin, as you look at kind of where the balance sheet is and the amount of free cash you were going to generate this year and where the stock price is, do you, will you remain aggressive in buying back shares or is this a point in time where you are more comfortable kind of building cash on the balance sheet and waiting for an opportunity either for an acquisition, or if something happens in the marketplace, taking advantage of buying back stock at that point in time? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Well, Kartik, I don't know about being aggressive. We've said for the last couple of quarters that we plan to be more systematic in just buying shares back rather than trying to chase the price. So, I anticipate that we will continue to be in the market. Obviously, we have a board meeting next week and that will be one of the topics we discuss. But I don't see any need and I don't think the board, based on previous conversations, sees a need for us to build cash on the balance sheet. We've got basically a $600 million revolver that's untapped and with our balance sheet and cash flow if we find an acquisition that's bigger than that we can get financing pretty quickly to satisfy that but I don't really see any need to keep a whole bunch of cash on the balance sheet. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, it's like we're going to work really hard not to create buying opportunities. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : And then, Jack, just one last question here. You talked about the pipeline being really strong and the success you've had on the credit union side, are you seeing \u2013 if you look at the pipeline and kind of spending trends, any changes and how banks or credit unions are spending? Are you seeing more growth in one area or another? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That's a good question, Kartik. Our sales have been pretty solid across board, there is not any one area, on previous earnings calls and I'd say essentially the same thing today, that I would call out as being an exceptional area. Again, we are continuing to see growth and momentum in some of the new services like the hosted network services. Some of the core activity is probably a little slower than what we like to see right now but that's in terms of in the quarter itself but it was offset by sales of other products and I don't necessarily think that observations on a particular quarter represent a trend at this point. So it's been more of kind of across the board or a number of different areas that nothing I would call out as being particularly unique or different. There is a lot of interest in some of our electronic delivery initiatives and the internet banking and mobile and tablet functionality that we are bringing to market, a lot interest in seeing what we are doing there. But that \u2013 again nothing I would point to as being a substantially bigger contributor. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : The one thing I would add that, Kartik, is our trend of existing in-house customers moving to outsource continues at a very nice pace. I think we had 11 in the first quarter that made that move, so that trend continues very nicely for us. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thanks, Kartik. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Koning from Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, hey guys. Nice job again. Yeah, and I guess I'm just wondering if we look back for the last probably 20, 30 years, there has been kind of always a little bit of fear that when the M&A environment kind of picks up for banks that it will hurt your spending. And the last couple of years now you and, Fiserv is like you too, have pretty high term fees but yet growth is pretty much as good as ever. And I mean is this just kind of the thesis again playing out that it really does \u2013 consolidation, it just doesn't matter that much. Maybe you can just comment on that a little bit. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Dave, it is certainly a factor that we have all dealt with for the last 20 or 30 years and managed, as you indicated, to continue to find ways to grow the business, additional products and services and kind of rounding out our offering. That is certainly our expectation. It does seem \u2013 and I haven't done the math to actually check this but it sort of feels like some of the industry consolidation has picked up a little bit here in the last six months or so, but again when you look at it on a full-year basis will that amount to a 5% shrinkage instead of 4% shrinkage? Maybe. But again I think it's just there are opportunities there, we continue to find them, and take advantage of those and we think we can continue to grow in the current environment. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah, and Dave as the slides in our investor presentation has shown for many years, the vast majority of the consolidation is happening at the low level, the lower tier of asset-size bank and credit unions which is not really our playground anyway. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : And actually \u2013 our target market has actually been pretty stable if not actually growing in some of the larger segments. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Okay. That's good and then the in-house maintenance revenue stream you mentioned there, I mean that growth I think was 5%, the strongest in several quarters now. Is that sustainable or was there anything in there that was a little bit one-off or is there just a new core replacement cycle with some of the credit unions that just allows that to stay high for a while? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Well, I would tell you, Dave, that the majority of that increase in our sales came from the credit union side and that is just because we continue to install a lot of in-house credit unions on that side of the business. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, as I mentioned, David, last year we converted six credit unions that were over $1 billion in assets and so that was throughout the year, so you were only seeing partial maintenance from those folks throughout the year. So this was \u2013 would be the first quarter that would have reflected all six of those for that full period and then again that's just the six that were over $1 billion. We had 31 credit union sales last year and I think some of those are probably being implemented this year. But anyway, it has just has been a solid contributor and I don't think there are any unusual one-times in there that led to that. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's good. And I guess just the last thing, the payment segment has been growing kind of high-single digits for a while, I think it was 6% this quarter. I mean, it's pretty much nothing, I mean it hasn't changed much. It decelerated just a touch but you are not seeing change really there either, right? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, it's \u2013 there certainly, there has been, we've talked about this on previous calls, there has been price compression, continues to be price compression particularly on renewals. It's a competitive business and lots of people trying to break into that area so \u2013 but no, beyond just kind of normal competitive activities that we've seen for a while, nothing particularly new. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great, thank you. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Dave. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thank you. Operator : And we have the question from the line of David Togut from Evercore. Your line is now open. Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning, this is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Can you go into more detail as to why you anticipate flattish EPS growth for the second quarter? Is it just a tough tax rate comparison or is there more to it? Thank you. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Well, there's two things. Like I said in the opening comments, Rayna, one, in the second quarter last year we had a one-time gain from sale of some products that came through the Goldleaf acquisition, the Tellerware (30:06) product which I think that gain was about $5 million in the quarter and then also the effective tax rate last year was 32% versus 36% this year. So those combined makes for a pretty tough comparable and a hurdle to get over just to be flat with last year. Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Got it, that's really helpful. And can you provide us an update on your estimate for FY 2016 capitalized software and internally software and maybe just go over what your largest investments are this year? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, so the areas that we are investing in and Kevin can probably give you better insight on the actual numbers but the areas that we are investing in, continue investing in are a number of product \u2013 architecture refreshments on the credit union side which we've talked about before. We've had a number of improvements that we made on the banking side. The larger types of investments in terms of the percentage of those dollars are going more towards payments-related products and mobile and electronic delivery solutions that we offer. Kevin, I don't know if you've got guidance on... Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah, right, I mean, the internal software \u2013 I mean obviously we've got a lot of progress going there. As Jack mentioned a lot of that is security-related and other things we just have to continue to invest in our infrastructure. And that's probably going to end up being $12 million to $14 million for the year. For computer software developed, which all of the areas that Jack just mentioned, payments of mobile and everything else with a lot of these products that are going to be driving future revenue, as my quote says, certainly in the earnings release, the vast majority of our investment is on these additional products, the new products and services there are going to be rolled out in the future but that's probably going to be somewhere in the $90 million to $95 million for the total year for cap software. Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Got it. Okay. You mentioned pricing compression in your electronic payments business. Should we think of mid-single digit growth as the new normalized revenue growth for that business? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right, that's probably the right way to think about it. Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Got it. Could you talk about head-to-head win rates for Symitar versus Fiserv DNA in the quarter? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I don't have that against that specific product. We continue to gain market share from a variety of competitive products. Our win rates are very solid. A lot of times when a financial institution, bank or credit union, goes through an evaluation process they may end up making the decision to stay with their current provider, usually after receiving a deep discount to do so. But I would tell you that our win rates remain very strong among those financial institutions who go through an evaluation and do decide to make a change from their current vendor and that's going to be anywhere from 50% to 60% plus win rate among those who will actually go through with a change from their current provider. In terms of breaking it down among which of the 15 different core solutions we see on the credit union side versus \u2013 or for that matter the number that we see on the banking side, I don't really track them product versus product. Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Got it. Could you call out the term fees in the second quarter of 2015 and your expectation for the second quarter of 2016? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Rayna, honestly I don't have that on \u2013 with me right now. Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : I don't have the company's last year second quarter. Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And just one final question, if you can just give us the end-of-period share count? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : 80.7 million roughly, 80.5 million. Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : And I'm showing no further question at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Kevin Williams for closing remarks. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thank you. Again, we want to thank you for joining us today to review our first quarter fiscal 2016 results. We are very pleased with the results from our ongoing operations and the efforts of all our associates to take care of our customers. Our executives, managers and all of our associates continue to focus on what is best for our customers and our shareholders.

Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker) Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Jack Henry & Associates Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thanks, Chelsea. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for the Jack Henry & Associates second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO. On the call with me today is Jack Prim, CEO. Also in the room with us is Dave Foss, President. The agenda for the call this morning is Jack will start with some of his thoughts about the business and on the performance of the quarter, then he will give it back to me, I'll provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release that we put out yesterday after market close, and then we'll open the lines up for some Q&A. I need to remind you that remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors which can cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate, due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jack. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Kevin. Good morning. We are pleased to report another strong operating quarter with record revenue and operating income. Outsourcing and payments again showed solid growth as did in-house maintenance based primarily on new credit union core system implementations. This is in spite of the continued movement of existing in-house customers to outsourcing with 12 current in-house bank and credit union customers signing to make that transition during the quarter. Despite the recent noise level in the stock market, in our view, business fundamentals remain strong and our clients continue to invest in solutions that can help them drive revenue, reduce costs and improve security. We had solid sales performances with all three brands finishing ahead of plan year-to-date, and sales pipelines remain strong. Last month, we announced a CEO transition that will take place July 1, at the start of our fiscal year, when Dave Foss will assume that role. This is a planned transition that the board and I have been working towards for several years. Dave will bring to the position over 30 years of financial industry experience, including his 17 years of experience at Jack Henry. During his career, Dave has had experience in literally every aspect of the financial institution core processing industry as well as the experience of having built our successful ProfitStars non-core processing business. He is well positioned to take JHA to the next level. I will remain Chairman of the board residing in Monett and working full-time in that role. I'll keep our Enterprise Risk Management group as a reporting entity to ensure that our company maintains its strong focus on and that the board has good visibility to our risk management activities in this critical area. It has been an honor to serve as the CEO of this company for the last 12 years, and I am excited to watch the continued success of Jack Henry & Associates under Dave's leadership. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for a closer look at the numbers. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thanks, Jack. During the quarter, our license revenue represented less than 1% of our total revenue. The vast majority of our license revenue is now included with bundled services and included in the support and services line of revenue. Our support and services line of revenue continues to drive our total revenue growth and it increased to $320.2 million, which is an 8% increase over the same quarter a year ago and represented 96% of total revenue. To break down our support and services for the quarter : implementation services of $15.9 million versus $19.4 million, which decreased 18% which is primarily due to just timing of the efforts and also because of the bundling; electronic payments of $130.5 million versus $121.5 million was up 7%; OutLink at $72.1 million was up 7%; in-house maintenance at $83.4 million was up 5%; and bundled services was $18.4 million, up 97% for the quarter. Reminder that bundled services contained license, implementation services, and maintenance revenue related to these multi-element contracts. Related to this revenue, I'd point out that our deferred revenue on the balance sheet increased $27.1 million or 7% compared to last year's quarter. Hardware decreased 14% for the quarter to $12 million from $13.9 million last year. Consolidated gross margins improved 43% for the quarter, compared to 42% last year's second quarter; support and service margins were steady at 43% and hardware margins improved 34% from 31%. Our operating expenses increased 12% for the quarter, compared to the year ago, which is primarily to the gain in the year ago quarter in our G&A for the sale of the TeleWeb products that were part of the AudioTel acquisition we did several years ago. Our operating margins for the quarter decreased slightly, also due to this gain last year. That's 25% compared to 26% a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter decreased a little to 30.0% from 32.1% the second quarter a year ago, primarily due to the reinstatement of research and experimentation credit in the fourth quarter or second \u2013 March (6:13) second fiscal quarter. Net income was up 10% to $59.3 million from $53.9 million, which led to EPS of $0.74 per share which was up 13% over last year. EBITDA for the year-to-date increased to $228.5 million compared to $210.8 million last year or an 8% increase. Depreciation and amortization expense was $63 million, with $26 million in depreciation and $37 million amortization compared to $59.4 million last year. Included in the total amortization is the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions which was down slightly to $9.5 million compared to $10.5 million last year, as some of those acquired intangibles have now fully amortized. Operating cash flows were up $20.1 million or 16% to $147 million for the year-to-date. We continue to invest in our company through CapEx for computer equipment, facilities and airplanes, which we took possession of our last two airplanes during the fourth quarter, so our fleet is now fully upgraded, which is a two-year process. And we continue to invest in development and new and existing products, to help continue our revenue growth in the future. We also continue to return investment to our shareholders through dividends of $40 million and stock buybacks of $155 million year-to-date. Our return on equity for the trailing 12 months is 24.2% and our total shareholder return on stock price appreciation and dividends for the trailing 12 months ended December 31 was just over 27%. We purchased 1.1 million shares during the quarter and 2.1 million shares year-to-date. For guidance for the remainder of the year, our revenue is still projected to grow in the upper mid single digits for the year, similar to the first half. To assist you with your modeling, the projected effective tax rate for Q3 FY 2016 will be about 33.5%, down slightly from 33.8% last year, so not a huge difference and the difference is primarily due to the full year of the R&D credit this year compared to only six months spread over last year. The tax rate in Q4 is expected to be 34%, giving a full-year effective tax rate of about 33.5%. For EPS guidance for the third fiscal quarter, we are projecting our de-conversion fees or early termination fees to be down significantly from last year's third quarter, with an estimated reduction in these termination fees of a little over $6 million in the third quarter or about $0.05 EPS impact. Therefore, based on this, it appears the current consensus estimate is $0.68 for Q3. It's probably a little aggressive, probably by a couple of pennies. So, we're probably going to be coming around the $0.66 for the third quarter because of this decrease in termination fees and also because we had a couple million this quarter over what we had last year. The fourth quarter consensus estimate out there at this time of $0.80 appears to be in the ballpark and pretty reasonable. That concludes our opening comments. And with that, we are now ready to take questions. Chelsea, will you please open the call lines up for questions? Operator : Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann with Avondale. Your line is now open. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC : Good morning everyone. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Pete. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC : Kevin, just a few housekeeping things. So, term fees in the fiscal second quarter, how did those compare year-over-year? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : The term fees were up $2.8 million compared to the second quarter last year fee. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC : You said up $2.8 million. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yes. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC : Okay. And then I know the acquired revenue was small, but about how much to the base did that contribute in the quarter? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Less than $1 million. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC : Okay. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : So, our organic revenue growth was still 7%. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC : Got it. Got it. Okay. And then just last question and maybe just a little bit of background. For the second quarter in a row we're seeing the credit union segment continue to really outperform nicely with very, very strong growth but being offset somewhat by a slowdown in the bank side. Can you talk about some of the gives and takes that account for that dynamic? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, Pete, this is Jack. There were a couple of things. There were a number of larger credit union implementations go-lives that certainly helped and most of those being from an in-house standpoint. The revenue impact, of course, under the new revenue recognition guidelines that we're operating under, so a lot of that's going to show up in the bundled area. But basically, there were a larger number of larger go-lives on the credit union side than what we had on the bank side. The bank side also was somewhat impacted by one of our larger customers being lost in an acquisition. And so there was some revenue impact in the opposite direction on the banking side from that as well. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yes, the other thing, Pete, I'd say is we continue to see really strong growth in both outsourcing and payments on the credit union side. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC : Great. That's helpful. Thanks. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yep. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Hey, morning. Jack, can you just talk about maybe the bank spending environment right now, if you're seeing any changes either up or down? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Kartik, it's pretty steady. Different banks are going to be investing in different things, some are doing projects in and around the mobile or online banking implementation or a refreshment. Core systems, there certainly continues to be a movement in that area, somewhat less aggressively on the banking side than on the credit union side and possibly a little less than what we've seen in some previous years. But spending in and around security and related products. So there is no one product I would point to that people are rushing to adopt and it's going to vary from institution to institution as to what their focus area is. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : And there is not a lot of talk about mobile obviously. Have you seen any pricing pressure on that or does your model allow you to take advantage of greater clicks that banks are seeing because of use of mobile. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We haven't really seen any recent pressure. I would tell you that probably 18 months ago we were seeing a fair amount of pressure on some of them, particularly on some of the mobile offerings as some low-cost options became available out in the market. I think we've adjusted accordingly. We have an opportunity to provide for the very price-conscious that want a pretty fully-featured system, but they are more price sensitive. We've got a solid offering there with a low price point on it. For somebody that wants a little more sophisticated mobile offering, we have that option as well, and that's going to be priced a little bit higher. But, as I've said, I think 18 months ago we were seeing more pricing pressure than what we're seeing today. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : And then, Kevin, just tax rate going forward, is 34% or 33.5%, a reasonable tax rate to look at going forward because of the R&D tax credit? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Well, Kartik, like I said in my opening comments, 33.5% is the right rate to use for the third quarter. Fourth quarter it's going to be about 34%, but for FY 2017, it's probably going to be somewhere between 35% and 35.5%, now that they have made the R&D credit permanent. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Perfect. Thanks. I appreciate it. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thanks, Kartik. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Good morning, guys. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Hi, Glenn. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): The first one, just going back on the credit union versus the bank growth, a couple things. So we've had a couple quarters now of credit union growth in sort of this 20% range and I guess there is a few conversions. It's been a nice pipeline of conversions that have been happening. Any reason to think where you don't continue at this sort of like 20% plus growth for another couple of quarters? And then on the bank side, if you could directionally quantify how much of a drag there was from that bank loss, so that we can kind of have a better idea for sort of core growth ex that bank loss? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Well, Glenn, from the credit union side, yes, I think we should continue to see very good growth for the next couple of quarters. Obviously, when we get in next fiscal year, we're going to start hitting some tougher comps. So I think we're going to continue to see very strong growth in the credit union side at least this fiscal year. On the bank side I'm not sure if I have the numbers right in front of me that tell you what the drag was, but it was obviously a couple of percentage points of revenue in the quarter for not just the one bank but for \u2013 there was two or three of them that got acquired or due to repricing that had an impact on payments primarily but it also impacted maintenance and other things. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Do you mean two points drag to the banking business or the overall total revenue? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Banking. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): And just to be clear on the \u2013 you sort of gave the 3Q and the 4Q EPS expectations, including what we've got year-to-date; you're kind of suggesting mid-$2.80s for the year, just to be clear? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yes, I think that's where we're going to wind-up, Glenn. I mean we're $1.38 year-to-date. I think third quarter is going to be in the $0.66-ish each range and right now I'm pretty comfortable with that consensus estimate of $0.80 out there in the fourth quarter. I think that gets you to about $2.84 or something like that. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): And the outsourcing, if I heard it right, it sounded like it decelerated to 7%. Is that for the same reasons that some of those \u2013 the bank losses or pricing or...? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : No, actually, Glenn, the outsourcing \u2013 if you net out the deconversion fees on outsourcing, it was actually more like a 12% growth year-over-year. So it's pretty much in line with where it has been. The real pressure came in the payments line. If you net out the deconversion fees on the payments line, the payments was only about 4% growth. If you net that out, that's where the real tough grow-over is from the drag from some of the repricing and loss of customers. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): And then the share buyback, you've been pretty consistent I guess at 1 million shares or so a quarter. Any reason to think you'd change that or perhaps get more aggressive? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : I don't know that we'll get any more aggressive at this point, Glenn, and obviously that's driven by the board, and we have our quarterly board meeting next week. So that will be a discussion at the board meeting just like it is every quarter and we'll decide where we go. But you're right, I mean, we said going into this year that we were going to be a little more aggressive. We bought 2.2 million shares year-to-date, which is about the guidance I gave at the front that we were going to buy for the year. So will we buy some more? Probably, but I don't know that we'll keep the same pace that we have in the first half. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens, Inc. Your line is now open. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning, Jack, Kevin and hello, Dave. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Quick question on the pipeline, Jack, you talked a little bit about that. As you look forward, and this is kind of I guess tied to a sub question of long-term growth outlook, you guys have been kind of peer leading among your peers for a while on growth, and Kevin you just commented at least for this year that the credit union pipeline looks really good. Can you give us a sense of what are the components of the pipeline that you guys look at most earnestly and how does that translate into how you think about long-term growth I guess combined bank and credit union business over the next few years? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Brett, I tend to focus more on the total backlog. At this point with license fees representing zero percent of our total revenue, support and services being 96%, hardware on a steady decline, so I tend to just focus more on total backlog, which by and large anymore is almost support and services. But yes, so on the heels of a strong sales quarter, as I mentioned all three brands were over 100%, I think the lowest performance was 105% or 106% from one of the three brands. In spite of that pipelines remained flattish even with closing that volume of business. So I'm not sure if I actually got to the point that you were looking to get to. Kevin, if you would add anything to that. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah, the other thing I'd add Brett is, one of the things that we obviously continue to focus on is the in to out movement because obviously that's a very good thing for our business long term and currently we're right at the 50% of our existing core customer base that are now outsourced. So we still got a long road ahead of us to continue those conversions. Through the first half, we're right on track to do basically what we did in the previous year. So, I think we did 23% in the first half, we did 46% last year. So, we're right on track to continue that same path, so that's something that I really watch. And then also we continue to look at the payments business and the opportunities we have there, not only just in bill pay, but also in passport and PPS and all of the different payments groups, remote deposit cash where we still got a pretty good runway there. So, those are the sort of things that I kind of look at to look at the future because obviously, as Jack said, those are big drivers, those are all important services and that's what's going to drive us going forward. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Any update on the \u2013 I can't remember the name of the product, but where you're helping folks outsource more of their \u2013 even their front office IT systems. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Hosted Network Services. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah, thank you. Any update on that. And you didn't mention that as one of kind of the major growers, but is that still something that could be a part of that growth system? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : I would tell you it's growing nicely Brett. I mean, as we've said originally, this is one that's going to be slow growing things because it's a complicated sale, it's a big decision for an FI to make to give us all of their servers, but it is growing, it's actually ahead of plan and growing very nicely. And is it contributing? Yes. Is it a huge contributor at this point? No. But it's like I said ahead of track. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I will just add to that, Brett, we're continuing to have increased go-lives, very good success from the institutions that have implemented it. So the reference base is building out there as to the advantage of this approach, and the average contract values that we're seeing continue to increase. So, a lot of good trends happening there. It's just, again, the percentage growth is very solid, but in terms of being to a point where it makes a meaningful impact from a revenue standpoint, not really there yet. But again, with the security environment and the talent acquisition and retention environment, particularly for technically oriented talent that we're all seeing right now, again, we believe that this is a very solid solution that's going to be a nice long-term contributor. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: And then last question, just thinking about margins over the medium term as well, you guys have had good margin performance and nice gross margins this quarter. You guys already have very high margins, kind of where do we go from here and where do the levers, if there are any, that we should be paying attention to? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Well, Brett, I mean, can some (23:31) opportunity for additional expansion come (23:34). I mean it's going to come from the continued growth in our outsourcing and payments groups, I mean that's going to be the drivers because those are the highest margin business. And we'll continue to leverage the existing infrastructure. But having said that, as Jack pointed out, security and compliance and other things are big issues. So, I don't know if there's going to be the same margin expansion that we've seen in the past, but I think there's still some opportunity. And I think going forward that we'll continue to see some opportunity for operating margin expansion on the G&A line and possibly selling and marketing. It won't come from the R&D line because we have to continue to reinvest in our product as we continue to grow and move upstream into the larger FIs. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Great. That's what I needed. Thanks, guys. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dave Koning with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, hey, guys, nice job. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thanks, Dave. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, I guess just a couple really, the termination fees I know you said would be down year-over-year in Q3, which makes sense. Is that mostly in payments or in outsourcing or a mix? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : It's a mix; it's across the board, Dave. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. I just wanted to make sure we... Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Last year in the third quarter, we had right at $9.5 million in termination fees and this year we think that's going to be about \u2013 under $3 million. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. But if we just take a few out year-over-year from each like if it's down 6 (25:10). Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, Okay. And then the other one, hardware, you maybe mentioned this a little earlier too, but hardware was down 14% year-over-year, I know it's immaterial now. Is it like accelerating its declines or should we just expect kind of 5% to 10% declines for a long time? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : I think you can just expect that, Dave. I mean the deal with hardware is, it's hard for us to predict because that's driven by IBM and other hardware providers. And when they come out with new upgrades and what they're going to force the customers to have, and as we continue to move customers from ins to outs, they're not going to be buying hardware upgrades. So it's just going to be a continual decrease in hardware. Now, the hardware margins should stay really solid, because the non-hardware parts of that hardware line of revenue, which is our higher margin business, like our jhaDirect and the (26:12) different things, that's going to continue to become a larger percentage of that line, which will help maintain the margins in the hardware line of revenue. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Good. And then, lastly just, like do the small banks ever ask you about blockchain? I mean, quite honestly, I don't really even understand it very much at all, but is this more of a bigger bank thing that that they're looking at it, or do the small banks every once in a while kind of ask you about it, or I mean is it just a non-issue? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That's a great question, Dave, and I would say that today small banks are not really asking about it. I fully expect that they will be, simply because there is so much noise in the media about it. We've got a number of folks that are looking at it, and looking at potential applications, which sounds like that's what the whole world is doing right now, is trying to figure out where, if anywhere, the blockchain technology might fit. Its first line of thought tends to be in and around the payments area, because of its original affiliation with Bitcoin. It's possible -certainly some types of payments, they talk about an average potential transaction time, settlement time of around seven minutes. Well, you know, that's pretty quick. If you're talking about something like a cross-border money transfer or a business-to-business payment relative to payment options that are out there today relative to an ATM transaction, relative to a debit card transaction at Target, seven minutes is probably going to be a little long for that to be the best application. And then there is the whole potential other areas of non-payment oriented transactions like land deed transactions, smart contracts and other things. So, there is an awful lot of people trying to figure out where if anywhere this might fit and I would include us in that category at this point. But we're not getting, frankly, questions from any of our customers at this point. But I fully expect that given how much discussion continues to take place around the technology, that that will change and they will want to know more about what it means once they come to understand it a little bit better. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, okay. Well, that's great. Thank you. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Dave. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Just a couple follow-ups and that was probably one of the best blockchain answers I have heard in a while. Jack you sort of alluded to that each of your segments was sort of I think trending ahead of quota year-to-date in terms of sales and bookings, could you sort of directionally kind of give us some sense what your sales growth looks like year-to-date across the segments? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I don't know that I know it on a year-to-date basis, I think there is three brands and I think I have said the lowest was about 105% of quota, one was 120% of quota. And I think the third one was somewhere in between those two, 115%-ish. So, it was a strong sales quota. Now I will tell you that first quarter, two of them were at plan, one was well behind, the overall average was right about 100%. So, we're right around 100% for the first quarter, strong fiscal second quarter and expectation would be 4% to 5% year-over-year. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah. The numbers Jack has given you Glenn are percentage of quota and I'd tell you that quota for all three brands went up. So, it's a kind of \u2013 I don't know that any of us in this room actually calculate that, but I would guesstimate that it's probably 4%, 5% growth over last year in total bookings. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Year-to-date. Okay. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): And then Kevin, this is a question for you on your favorite topic, the bundled services, but the question really is when does the bundled service accounting turn to a revenue and profit tailwind, meaning I was under the impression that this was sort of a neutral impact and perhaps fiscal 2017, you actually get a benefit from the accounting as you recognize some of that deferred revenue faster than you refill the deferred revenue funnel? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Well, one of the things I will tell you Glenn and I made sure to point that out in my opening comments. Our deferred revenue went up 7% this year over last year, which is kind of unusual. And my point there is because of the new referrals, we are actually continuing to defer faster than we are recognizing revenues actually through the bundling. So, we are continuing to defer a lot of revenue, could there be some tailwinds come out of that in 2017 as we do some things? Yeah. And I will tell you Glenn with the new referrals coming out and they keep changing the date, it's either 2018 or 2019 now. We are going to have to do some things to try to ramp-up those contracts, get the revenue out and the timing of that \u2013 some of that is not up to us, some of that is up to the customers when they'll actually either accept the products or whatever. So could there be some tailwinds in 2017? Yeah, but right now we're still deferring faster than we're recognizing. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thanks. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yep. Operator : Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Kevin Williams for closing remarks. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thanks, Chelsea.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jack. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Kevin, good morning. We are pleased to report another strong operating quarter, with record revenue and operating income. We had good organic growth at 7%, in spite of challenges in the form of substantially lower deconversion fees compared to the year ago quarter, and the impact of several large customer losses in our payments businesses. Fewer deconversions is good news for our business in the long run, but presents challenges in the near-term as far as revenue growth comparisons, and especially in terms of operating margins. Our payments business was impacted in several areas during the quarter. This was the first quarter that we felt the full impact of the lost bill payment revenue resulting from the Susquehanna BB&T merger. Industry consolidations similarly impacted our debit card processing business with several customers, and a large commercial remote deposit capture customer decided to consolidate their business to a system that was part of their existing point of sale system. While these losses will be a factor in our fourth quarter revenue as well, we expect new revenue additions to begin to grow over these losses in our first fiscal quarter. Our outsourcing and cloud revenue growth was solid at 10%, and our in-house maintenance again showed good growth at 6%, even as our new and existing customers increasingly opt for outsourced product delivery. As previously announced, we have signed a definitive agreement to sell our Alogent Deposit Automation software business to Battery Ventures. Financial details have not been disclosed at the request of the buyer, and there are financial considerations that could impact the final purchase price and resulting gain on the sale between now and closing, which is expected to be at the end of May. The Alogent product is a strong offering and is highly competitive in the Tier-1 financial institution space. This segment of the market is not a focus area for us, and we felt the product could be a better fit for another owner. Our business fundamentals remain strong, and all three of our brands again finished the quarter ahead of their sales plans. Our previously announced CEO transition remains on track for a smooth hand off on July 1. Dave Foss has immersed himself in the few areas of the business he was not already involved with, and will be fully prepared to take the reins in July. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst conference in Denver next week and with that, I'll turn it back over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thanks, Jack. License revenue represented less than 1% of our total revenue, which is the vast majority of license revenue, if you'll recall, is now included in the bundled services and included in our support and services line of revenue, which our support and services line of revenue continues to drive our total revenue growth, and it increased to $319.6 million, for an 8% increase over the same quarter a year ago, at $296.9 million. And this represented 96% of our total revenue in both years. To break down our support and services revenue, implementation services was down 16% to $15.9 million this year, from $18.9 million last year. So electronic payments was up 2% for all of the reasons that Jack mentioned, some of the tough comparables and grow-overs. It grew to $121.4 million from $119.3 million last year. OutLink increased 10% to $76.5 million versus $69.7 million, in-house maintenance, as Jack mentioned, was up 6% to $80.6 million versus $76 million last year, and our bundled services which, again, is all of the license implementation and maintenance for those products, that the last products installed during the quarter, increased to $25.3 million from $13 million last year. Related to this revenue, our deferred revenue on the balance sheet increased $12.7 million or 3.4% compared to last year's, which is where the majority of the bundled revenue is coming from. Hardware increased 8% for the quarter to $13.2 million from $12.2 million. Our consolidated gross margins decreased slightly to 42% for the quarter, compared to 43% in last year's quarter, primarily due to the decrease in one-time deconversion fees during quarter. Our support and service margins decreased to 42% from 43% because this is where the deconversion revenue goes last year. Our hardware margins improved to 28% from 25% last year primarily due to sales mix within the hardware line. Our total operating expenses increased 8% for the quarter compared to a year ago which primarily was due to increased personnel expense in both R&D and G&A. Our operating margin for the quarter decreased slightly to 24%, again driven a lot by the deconversion fees. The effective tax rate for the quarter decreased a little to 32.1% from 33.8% in the third quarter a year ago primarily due to the reinstatement of the Research and Experimentation Credit. Net income was up 6% to $53.9 million from $50.7 million which lead to EPS of 68% which was up 9% over last year's EPS of $0.63 for the quarter and beat consensus by $0.02 for the quarter. Obviously, the decrease in deconversion fees impacted the quarter. If you consider the deconversion fees, if they would have remained flat with last year, our quarter would have shown revenue gross margin and operating income all growth of 9% with net income growth of 12%, so there was a significant impact due to that decrease in deconversion fees. Our EBITDA for year-to-date increase to $340.5 million compared to $317.7 million last year, or a 7% decrease. Depreciation, amortization which is now disclosed in the press release, however, included in that total amortization is the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions which was down slightly to $14.2 million compared to $15.3 million last year for the first nine months. Operating cash flows were up $24.5 million, or 13% to $207 million for the year. We continue to invest in our company through CapEx for computer equipment, facilities and airplanes, we took possession of our last new airplane during the second quarter, so our fleet is now fully upgraded as of 12/31/2015. We continue to invest in the development of new and existing products to help continue our revenue growth in the future, primarily in the payments areas, our mobile offerings, and we continue to enhance our core offerings. We also continue to return investment to our shareholders through dividends by way of $62 million in dividends year-to-date and also stock buybacks of $155.1 million year-to-date. We did not buy any stock back during the third quarter due to the timing of the announcement of the Alogent disposition but we should be back in the market shortly due to a lack of viable M&A targets in the market. Our return on equity for the trailing 12 months was 23.6% as of March 31. As far as guidance, revenue is still projected to grow in the upper mid-single-digits for the year, similar to the first three quarters. Also, to assist with your modeling, the projected effective tax rate for Q4 will be approximately 33%. The fourth quarter guidance that we provided previously of $0.80 continues to appear reasonable at this time, and this does not include any gain or impact from the Alogent disposition that we announced recently, which we will disclose those financial impacts of that after final close. We just recently kicked off our budget process for FY 2017, so we're not quite ready to provide solid guidance, but it would appear that revenue growth should continue at approximately the same level next year in the upper mid-single-digits, margins will remain strong, but price compressions on renewals and other factors that we are growing over will make margin expansion difficult next year. Our effective tax rate for FY 2017 will be approximately 34.5%. That concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions. Lillian, will you please open the call up for questions? Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Hey, good morning, Kevin and Jack. Kevin, you said, from an acquisition standpoint, maybe not as many opportunities; is that a reflection of price, or is that a reflection of maybe assets that make sense for the portfolio? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : It's a little bit of both, Kartik. I will tell you that we have seen a wave of opportunities come across our desk in the last couple of months that either, one, it just didn't make sense for us, it didn't fit our strategy or it's actually a broken company, but also, the valuations are just astronomically high out there, the expectations for valuations. So, we will continue to look, and obviously we'll find the right one, and would we pay up for the right opportunity, if it was the right fit and \u2013 that we could leverage across all three brands? Absolutely, but they are just few and far between. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : And then, Kevin, you said, at least from an overview for FY 2017, maybe not to expect margin expansion because of some pricing on renewals, and I'm wondering, is there a change in the market from a pricing standpoint, or is this the usual pricing compression you see in renewals? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : It's pretty much the same thing, Kartik. I mean, it's just \u2013 it's not really any worse, but I will say that, in all of our payments and even some of our outsourcing, when you're looking at any long term contract that's coming up for renewal, there is consultants in just about every one of those deals that are primarily in there just to get discounts on the renewals. And it's kind of a different animal, kind of a growing breed out there that, five years ago, there was a lot of those renewals that you wouldn't even see a consultant in. But they are in every deal now, and that's just driving to more pricing compression on renewals. And it's a challenge to grow over those. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : All right. Thank you very much. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : You bet. Thanks, Kartik. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. Your line is now open. Anthony Cyganovich - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning. This is Anthony Cyganovich on behalf of David. What were the main drivers of the 24% increase of revenue in credit union systems and services segment, and do you believe this growth is sustainable for fiscal year 2017? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Well, a lot of the growth in the credit union side, I'll tell you, came from a lot of different areas. But there was solid growth in \u2013 payments growth was up double-digits, our outsourcing in credit unions was up over 30%, maintenance was up in the mid-double-digits. And then there was quite a bit of increase in bundled revenue. So I mean, there was just a lot of strong drivers going in the credit union space. And the good thing is, the vast majority of what I just said are all recurring revenues. So yeah, we should continue to see a very healthy growth going forward. Do I think they continue to be at the 24%? I don't know about that, but it's going to continue to be very strong in the near future. Anthony Cyganovich - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks, that's helpful. What were the major wins in that segment in the quarter, and kind of what does your pipeline look like for 2017 bookings? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Anthony, we had pretty much a solid performance across-the-board, a number of new core wins. I don't know if there's any one that I'd particularly carve out as being particularly noteworthy. But, again, just it's been a very solid and consistent performance out of the credit union group. And keep in mind too, that there would not have been any wins in the quarter that would have contributed to that growth level \u2013 the way the revenue recognition works is anything we sold in that quarter, we're probably a year away from seeing much in the way of any kind of revenue impact from that. So, it wouldn't have been any one thing that drove the business in Q3. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah, one of the biggest drivers of credit union is the continued increase in our outsourcing as we continue to not only sell new customers outsourcing but also the ongoing trend of our existing in-house customers moving to outsourcing and the uplift in revenue from that. Anthony Cyganovich - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And just another question. By our calculations, your software capitalization increased 36% year-over-year. Could you talk about what the major R&D projects were that were driving such high growth and what your projections are for software cap growth in 2017, as well as what you expect the R&D expense to be on your income statement, what the impact might be? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Well, as was said in the press release and in my opening comments, I mean, there are a large number of projects that are going on and a lot of those projects are new projects that are getting ready to go into beta in the next quarter or two, some of those in payments, a direct biller offering that will drive new revenue. We've got some new treasury services and cash management offerings that are in development that will be coming out in beta shortly, that will be driving new revenues. We continue to invest heavily into all of our mobile and digital channel because that is a huge requirement from all of our customers. And then we continue to enhance our core products. I mean, we've got about 50 major projects going on right now. So, I think our cap software is going to end up about $100 million for this year. I think it's going to level off for FY 2017. But like I said in my opening comments, we're still early in the budgeting process, but it should level off in FY 2017 but we're going to continue to invest in our product because that's what's going to drive our growth ongoing. Anthony Cyganovich - Evercore Group LLC : Great. That's good color. And just finally, did you \u2013 I'm sorry if I missed it, did you say what the dollar amount of the deconversion fees were in quarter and what they were in the prior year quarter? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : They were down $4.5 million from about $9 million last year. Anthony Cyganovich - Evercore Group LLC : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yep. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Koning with Baird. Your line is now open. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys, nice job. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Hey, Dave. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, I guess first of all, just I think you said Alogent \u2013 I think you said the sale in late May. Does your guidance right now include like your fiscal 2017 thought process upper mid-single-digits, does that include kind of the headwind from revenue going away from Alogent or not? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yes. Because Alogent, as Jack said, it's a very strong product and it's very good in a Tier-1 space, but it was not a huge thing for us. I mean, just remind everybody, Alogent was a piece of Goldleaf when we bought Goldleaf in 2010. It was a small subsidiary of that. Total revenue of Alogent was roughly $25 million. So, in this quarter, it's not going to have much impact on revenue. Will it have a slight impact on operating income of $1 million or $1.5 million? Yeah, but that's in our guidance and we're comfortable that we can grow over that. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, got you. That makes sense. In the payments growth, you mentioned 2% this quarter, and mentioned that some of the impacts continue into next year. Usually when there's a bigger event, like we would think there would be four quarters before it anniversaried of a little slower growth, but it sounds like, is there enough in the pipeline that you can actually kind of reaccelerate by Q1 already? Is that kind of your thought? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Well, there's several things, Dave. One, as Jack mentioned, Susquehanna actually went away in our second quarter, so obviously, that's a big impact on both iPay and our PassPort business that we're having to grow over. As Jack also mentioned, we had a large private company that was using a different POS system, and they did away with our EPS, and that was actually in our Q1 of this year. So, we're about anniversaried that one. It's going to take a while, obviously, to anniversary Susquehanna, but we've still got a lot of payments business in the pipeline. We continue to grow that business good, like I said, the payment business (19:08) on the credit union side grew extremely well, so it's the bank side we're really trying to grow over this in. So, Q4 is going to continue to be a challenge on the payments, but I think Q1, you're going to start seeing the growth come back. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, on the implementation revenues, all through this year, it's probably been, on average, maybe down 10% year-over-year, but it doesn't sound like \u2013 it doesn't sound at all like there's less work or less pipeline. Like, why is revenue down in that segment again, and does that come back next year? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Well, Dave, understand that the vast majority of that implementation is now into the bundled services line. So, you're seeing a decrease in implementation, just like you're seeing an increase \u2013 a decrease, I'm sorry \u2013 a decrease in implementation just like you saw a decrease in license fees, because those are now in the bundled services line. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): But if all of the historical results are restated, though, I would imagine it's all on the same basis, so last year, you had more implementation revenue than this year? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : You're absolutely right, David. But it really comes down to what products we're selling and what products we're installing in any given quarter, whether you take the implementation revenue in the quarter as implementation revenue, or it goes into deferred revenue and you recognize it \u2013 and you roll it out in the bundled services out of deferred revenue at a later date. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got you, okay. So it's more just a shift in kind of the delivery rather than anything else? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Correct. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Well, thank you. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : You bet. Thanks, David. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brett Huffer (sic) [Huff] (20:48) with Stephens. Your line is open. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: It's Brett Huffer (sic) [Huff] (20:53), guys. How are you? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Hello, Brett Huffer (sic) [Huff] (20:55). Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Congrats on a nice quarter. I had two questions. One is sort of, a I think more straightforward, and one is a little bit bigger picture. The straightforward one is, you guys are getting into the cash management business, we like that business, and it seems like there's a handful of good vendors in there. Can you just tell us, sort of, what your thought is on entering that business? Is it just that your customers are asking for you to go ahead and do something that's integrated, or is there a new feature functionality set that makes sense? And then my second question is, just looking at the growth, which is continuing to be peer-leading, so congrats on that, can you break it down a little bit into \u2013 for us, on what's \u2013 like what drove the growth this quarter? Was it payments volume that was up, or was it the rolling implementation or revenue recognition from a big credit union \u2013 some good credit union strength, or just kind of give us a sense of how that breaks out, and which part of that is sustainable as we move into next year? Thanks. John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Brett, this is Jack. I'll comment on cash management. So we've had cash management offerings as part of our internet banking offering for a number of years. What we've seen in the last couple of years, generally from our larger banks, but certainly not exclusively to that group, is a stronger requirement for more advanced functionality than what our standard cash management offering had. So, we kind of got a twofold approach. We're doing some extensions, or enhancement, of that existing cash management system that we think will meet the needs of a number of those folks, and then we're kind of doing a start-from-scratch development of a current cash management offering that will be a new product and priced accordingly, similar to other fully-featured cash management offerings of its type that are available in the market today. Don't anticipate that there will be hundreds of our customers that will opt for that higher-end cash management system, but certainly believe it will meet a need for a good number of them and will be particularly important in our sales efforts to banks in that $2 billion to $20 billion asset range where a stronger cash management, treasury services offering is needed. Kevin, do you have some comments on growth and the drivers in the quarter? Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Sure. Brett, I mean, one of the things in an ongoing, one of the things you have to think about is, I mean, our license revenue in the quarter was $292,000. In fact, credit unions had no license revenue in that line. It all is now going into the bundled services line as we delivered the last product on those multi-product contracts, but I mean the really big drivers, Brett, haven't changed any. If you think about it, I mean, the in-house maintenance up 6% for the quarter, 5% year-to-date, I mean that's a good solid base, it's 20% \u2013 28% of our revenue base continues to grow nicely. Our outsourcing, which is about 20% of our revenue, is growing double-digits, it's 10% or 12% for the quarter and year-to-date, so that's a good driver. I mean, payments was a challenge this quarter, up 2%. It's still up a little over 5% year-to-date. Like I said, the fourth quarter is going to be another quarter of a little challenge on payments, but I think that's going to go back to nice growth in FY 2017. So, again, it's just going to be our support and services line of business, that's just going to continue to drive our growth in a number of different areas, so there's no one specific area that is driving the growth. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. That's what I needed, guys. Thanks again. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thanks, Brett Huffer (sic) [Huff] (24:47). Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Shane Svenpladsen with Avondale Partners. Your line is now open. Shane Trow Svenpladsen - Avondale Partners LLC : Good morning. Just a quick one for me. It appears there's more demand among financial institutions for next-generation digital banking solution. Are you seeing more opportunities to upsell that type of solution within your existing client base? John F. Prim - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Shane, it's Jack. We are and the acquisition of Banno that we did about two years ago was one of the large drivers of that not because they had an off-the-shelf digital offering, but because they had some technology and a staff that was highly focused on that, we felt like we could go from having a very, very successful, as we have for some time, internet banking offering to more of a current technology, digital banking channel solution. And that's been one of, as Kevin mentioned, among the major R&D investment areas, that's been one of the ones that has drawn a good bit of our technology investment. So, we're beginning to roll out sort of the initial releases of that new offering yet this summer. I believe it's going to be a highly-competitive offering there and I think there's going to be a nice opportunity to move folks to kind of the next generation of these types of digital solutions. Shane Trow Svenpladsen - Avondale Partners LLC : Thank you. That's very helpful. I will get back in the queue. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thanks, Shane. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Kevin Williams with any closing remarks. Kevin D. Williams - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Thanks, Lillian. Again, we look forward to seeing many of you at our 2016 Analyst Day event that we held next week, actually next Monday, May 9 at the Westin property at the Denver, Colorado Airport. We will provide presentations from all of the Executives; the three of us, our CTO, our Division Presidents and all of our National Sales Mangers will be there Monday afternoon for presentations. We'll follow that with a reception and a mini Tech Fair that night to highlight some of our products. Banno will be there for those of you that are coming, that are interested in seeing some of the things we're doing. With that, I want to thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter fiscal 2016 results. We're pleased with the results from our ongoing operations and the efforts of all of our associates to take care of our customers. Our Executives, Managers and all of our Associates continue to focus on what is best for our customers and shareholders.

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode to reduce background noise. But later we will be holding a question-and-answer session after the prepared remarks and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your first speaker for today, Kevin Williams. You have the floor, sir. Kevin Williams : Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for the Jack Henry & Associates fourth quarter fiscal year-end 2016 earnings call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO. On the call with me today is Jack Prim, our Executive Chairman of the Board; and David Foss, our CEO. The agenda for the call this morning, I will turn the call over shortly to Jack, so he can make some opening comments. Then Dave will provide some of his thoughts about the business and performance of the quarter; and then I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after the market close, provide some initial guidance for FY 2017, and then we will open the lines for Q&A. I need to remind you that remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends, or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these Risk Factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and forward-looking statements. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jack. Jack Prim : Thanks, Kevin, good morning. I'm happy to join you this morning following another strong quarterly performance, probably worse on one-time events in the quarter all contributed positively to our performance. And Dave and Kevin will discuss in more detail after netting out all the benefits from these one-time events, our quarterly operating performance would have still been very strong. Our previously announced CEO transition took place as planned on July 1. Transition was very smooth. The related organizational changes were made and well received by employees. This acceptance was helped by Dave's 17-year tenure in the organization as it helped employee's rollout, there are unlikely to be major directional changes, our shareholders should have similar expectations. Congratulations to Dave on his new role and I will now turn it over to him for some additional details on the quarter. David Foss : Thank you, Jack. Good morning everyone. We're pleased to report another strong operating quarter with record revenue and operating income and I would like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work that went into producing those results for the quarter and for the fiscal year. The fourth quarter provided a nice ending to a good overall performance for the year. Revenue increased 10% for the quarter and increased 7% excluding the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters. Organic revenue growth was also 10% for the quarter because of the impact of our acquisition of Bayside on July 1 last year was not material to our numbers. As discussed on the last call, our payments business is continuing to grow over some significant customer losses in late FY 2015 and early FY 2016, but despite that pressure, we posted an 8% increase in payments revenue and a 5% increase excluding deconversion fees. Our outsourcing and cloud revenue growth for the quarter was 21% and if you exclude the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters, we saw a very solid 14% increase. Although we continue to have a number of large development projects ongoing, we have released several new products in the past few months. So you will know that the capitalized software declined during this quarter over our previous run rate on a sequential basis. Although, I don't expect a continued decline in this area, I do believe that the rate will normalize going forward. As previously announced, we completed the sale of our Alogent Deposit Automation software business to Battery Ventures at the end of May. Obviously this transaction creates some noise in our numbers, so Kevin will provide more detail on the impacts of this transaction in his comments. As a reminder, Alogent was a division of Goldleaf, when we completed that acquisition a few years ago. The Alogent Solution has a strong offering in the Tier 1 financial institution space but this segment of the market which is essentially comprised of the top150 banks is not a focus area for us and we felt the business could be a better fit for another owner. Once again, all three of our brands, finished the fiscal year ahead of their sales plans which positions us well for FY 2017. We just completed our annual sales pick up, with all of our sales reps and they are already off to a good start. Overall our business fundamentals remain strong and our associates are optimistic about the coming year. As Jack mentioned earlier, our CEO transition is complete as of July 1. On behalf of our approximately 6,000 associates, our customers, and our shareholders, I would like to thank Jack for his many years of service to our company and congratulate him on his outstanding 10 years as CEO. I look forward to continuing my working relationship with him on his new role as our Executive Chairman. With that I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Dave. Our support and services line of revenue which represents 96% of our total revenue for the fourth quarter and fiscal year-end continues to drive our revenue growth. To break our support and services down a little bit implementation of service revenue of $14.7 million versus $17.9 million or down 18% for the quarter. As Dave said, electronic payments of $131.5 million versus $121.4 million increased 8% for the quarter. Our OutLink outsourcing division grew to $84.1 million from $69.7 million or 21% increase. Our in-house maintenance increased to $81.4 million versus $76.2 million or 7% increase, and our bundled services grew to $41.7 million from $33.4 million or 25% increase. Our total revenue grew 10% for the quarter and grew 7% if you back out the total deconversion fees of $14.9 million in the quarter and $5 million in year ago quarter. For the fiscal year total revenue grew 8% and grew 7% if you back out total deconversion fees of $37.6 million this year versus $26.9 million last year. Our total operating expenses decreased 21% for the quarter and increased 1% for the fiscal year compared to year ago period primarily to the gain on sale of Alogent, net of related expenses for a net impact of $18.5 million. Without this impact total operating expenses actually increased 12% for the quarter and 9% for the year. Increased personnel expense in R&D and G&A drove the majority of the increase for both the quarter and fiscal year. Disposal of some assets also increased the R&D expense for the quarter. Our operating margin without the impact of Alogent remained level at 27% for the quarter and 25% for the year compared to the prior year. The effective tax rate for the quarter decreased to 27.4% for the quarter from 32.1% last year. But again without the impact from Alogent the effective tax rate would have been right in line with last year at 32% for the fourth quarter. For the year, effective tax rate was 31% with the impact of Alogent and 32.4% without Alogent compared to 33.3% last year. The net tax rate without Alogent was lower this year due primarily to the reinstatement of the Research and Experimentation Credit as we got an additional half year catch-up; therefore we anticipate next year's effective tax rate to be close to 34% to 34.5%. Net income was up 39% to $84.3 million from $60.5 million a year ago which led to EPS of $1.06 which was up 42% over last year EPS of $0.75. Excluding the effects of Alogent our net income would have been $66.5 million or $60.5 million a year ago and EPS of $0.84 compared to $0.75 or 12% increase. So the fiscal year our net income was $240.9 million up 18% from $211.2 million last year which represent EPS of $3.12 up from $2.59. Excluding the effects of Alogent our net income would have been $231.4 million or up 10% from $211.2 million and EPS of $2.90 per share for the fiscal year compared to $2.59 last year or 12.1% increase. EBITDA for the year-to-date increased to $491.6 million compared to $437 million last year or a 12.5% increase. Without the effects of Alogent gain, EBITDA grew roughly 9%. Included in the total amortization disclosed in the press release, is amortization of intangibles from acquisitions, which was down to $18.4 million compared to $20 million last fiscal year. Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software plus the proceeds of sale of assets, was $237.4 million for FY 2016 or $2.98 per share compared to $236.8 million or $2.90 per share in FY 2015. Free cash flow was impacted this year by increased capitalized software, which cap software for the quarter actually decreased approximately about $5 million sequentially compared to Q3, which -- this was also part of the increase in R&D expense and impact on operating margin in the quarter. Also we are projecting cap software to be down slightly in FY 2017 compared to FY 2016. Also impacting our cash flow was our annual maintenance billing collections were a little slower this year compared to last year by approximately $10 million at June 30, which those collections are subsequently caught up. We continue to return investment to our shareholders through dividends of $84.1 million for the year and stock buybacks of $175.7 million for the year. Our return on equity for the trailing 12-months was 25% or 23.3% after backing out the impact of Alogent. So FY 2017 initial guidance. Revenue growth will be slowed in FY 2017 as we grow over a couple of rather large headwinds. The first is obviously the sale of Alogent, which represent $28.4 million in revenue in FY 2016 or about a 2% headwind. The other is the expected significant decrease in deconversion fees in FY 2017. We anticipate these one-time deconversion fees to decrease by just under $12 million or approximately 1% headwind compared to FY 2017, which certainly is more in line with what we saw in FY 2017 or FY 2015, I'm sorry. The majority of this anticipated decrease is due specifically to two major deals that we discussed on previous earnings calls. Close to $5 million from one deal in December, in the December quarter, and $4.6 million from one in the June quarter, which is timing of that and the others in the fourth quarter was a large part of the fourth quarter $0.04 EPSD. But we do not anticipate losing any of large deals of this significance this year, which is why we're lowering the expectations. However, both of these were created by M&A activity over which we have no control. So backing these out for an apples-to-apples comparison, the base revenue would be reduced to little over $40 million to a base of $1.314 billion for FY 2016 and based on that revenue growth for FY 2017 would be somewhat in line with this year in the area of about a 7% growth. So with these headwinds right now, we anticipate actual reported revenue growth to be in the area of 4% for FY 2017. Obviously, the $19.5 million gain on disposal of business during FY 2016 must be backed out of operating expenses to arrive at a comparable operating income for comparison. Even with a loss of the large electronic payments customer, as Dave mentioned last year, that we talked about previously, this creates large headwinds on our margins. However, we do anticipate a small margin expansion, primarily in the second half of the year. So from the projected approximately 4% reported revenue growth we anticipate, operating income growth should be approximately 6% or a little better after backing out the gain compared to FY 2016 operating income. Without the headwinds of Alogent and the expected reduction deconversion fees, our operating income would have actually been projected to grow over 10% FY 2017. So our business operations remain very strong. We just have a couple of unusual items to grow over this coming year. As mentioned above, the effective tax rate for FY 2017 would be in the range of 34% to 34.5% compared to 32.4% in FY 2016, adjusting for the Alogent gain, which obviously will be a headwind on net income growth. For EPS guidance, first, you need the back out the gain on the sale of Alogent net of related cost, which was $0.22 of EPS this year, to determine a net base of $2.90 for FY 2016. The change in the effective tax rate represents approximately $0.05 EPS headwind and the anticipated decreased deconversion fees represent approximately $0.10 EPS headwind. So this is a very large headwind of approximately $0.15 EPS impact. Therefore, at this time, we expect reported EPS to grow 5% to 6% over actual reported FY 2016 after adjusting for the gain on sale of business. For FY 2017 EPS, should be in the range of $3.04 to $3.06 aided by some planned stock buyback, which was slightly lower than the current consensus estimate of $3.08. Again, our operations of business continue to be very strong. Obviously, we will update these guidance quarterly as we proceed through FY 2017. This concludes our opening comments, and we are now ready to take questions. Andrew, will you please open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Hi good morning. Kevin, I just wanted to ask a little bit about cash from operating activities. It just looks like working capital was a little bit more negative and I'm wondering if that's just timing or if there's anything more than that included in that? Kevin Williams : Well it was just timing and then there was some impacts from just the accrual of income taxes and the timing of payment of taxes and different things like that Kartik, there's really nothing unusual on the working capital. Kartik Mehta : So if that will work itself out, I'm assuming over the next couple of quarters? Kevin Williams : Yes. Kartik Mehta : Okay. And then as you look at your business and you look at the backlog as you talked about in the past, what level of confidence do you have in the recurring revenue or the revenue guidance for FY 2017. Obviously, excluding the one-time stuff with Alogent and the deconversion fees? Kevin Williams : Well, I mean, recurring revenues is still about 80%, Kartik, and most of that is tied to either long-term contracts or in-house maintenance contracts, which all those have already been renewed by this time. So that's there in deferred revenue which current revenue was up a little bit. So for that part, we feel extremely good. We've got the backlog of things to be delivered. We've got a very strong backlog, banks and credit units that's assigned to move from in to out. We have a very solid year of contracting those institutions move in and out. So at this time, I feel very confident about the guidance that we just gave on revenue. Kartik Mehta : And just one last one. As you look at, I know this by quarter-by-quarter, it's difficult, but as you look at the year that just ended and the market share on the credit union side, your thoughts on how you ended up the year with as far as market share and based on what you are, of course, the installations that you're looking forward into FY 2017 what that might do? David Foss : Kartik, it's Dave, I'll answer that one. So we had a very solid year on the credit union side. We ended up signing 21 competitive takeaways for the year. The good news for us is when you look at the $500 million and above credit union space and larger credit union, half of the credit union who decided to make a change from their core provider to another core provider, half of them decided to go with our Episys Solution. So we are well-positioned in the credit union space, having really solid success, continuing to have solid success in the credit union space and feel like our Episys Solution, in particular, is positioned really well to compete with anyone in the market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens. Your line is open. Brett Huff : Good morning guys. Can you hear me oaky? Kevin Williams : Hi, Brett. Brett Huff : Hi. Two questions for you. One, Kevin is there anything in the numbers right now that you could point out due to the change in accounting you guys had to bundle your revenue, all that kind of stuff? As I recall, it was going to be a little bit of a revenue headwind in the first couple of years and may be switching to a small tailwind in the out years. Are you seeing any of that? Or do we need to pay attention to that from an order of magnitude point of view as we think about the next few years? Kevin Williams : Yes. I don't know that there's much difference, Brett. I mean, obviously, the bundled revenue is up a little bit this year, but it appears based on the timing of delivery and different things that the bundled revenue should be similar in FY 2017, where it was in FY 2016 at least that's what it looks like right now. So there shouldn't be, I think, we've made may have got a little tailwind this year, but I think, it's going to be relatively flat next year. And then we go into the new rev rules the following year which all bets are off at that point. Brett Huff : Okay. And then, second question is on investment. I know you guys got a number of investments going on. Can you give us an update on the key ones? I know there's a UI change and you guys are going through and a few other things can you just give us the highlight and update on top two or three? David Foss : Sure, yes, Brett, it's Dave again. So I mentioned in my opening comments that we rolled out a few of those solutions. So Biller Direct, for example, is one that I've highlighted in the past. We rolled out the first version of Biller Direct in June on schedule. We have another enhanced version coming out later in the year. Our experienced development project, which has been redoing the user experience of the front-end for our core solutions and most all of our integrated complementary solutions that's about done, we rolled that out recently. Our cash management solution, and that's separate from our treasury management initiative, but our cash management solution we rolled out in the quarter. So several of those have been rolled out to customers now. Ongoing, we have the Episys database project that we talked about before our treasury management project that is ongoing that will come out in calendar 2017. And then of course, Banno, which is our mobile platform, our digital platform continues to be a ongoing development project for us. Brett Huff : Okay, that's helpful. And then last question, Kevin, can you just -- you mentioned that there was some I think extra R&D expense because of Alogent. Can you just walk us through why that was the case? If we're selling the business, why is there more R&D? So I just didn't quite understand the math there. Kevin Williams : No, that's not what I said, Brett. I said that cap software was down for the quarter, which obviously increased R&D expense for the quarter. Brett Huff : Okay, got you. That's what I needed. All right. And then last question just some housekeeping. Kevin, I missed this early on. I think you said adjusted ex-Alogent, the tax rate was 32%, was that right? Kevin Williams : 32.4%, I believe, yes. Brett Huff : Okay. That's what I needed. Thanks guys. Kevin Williams : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann from Avondale. Your line is open. Pete Heckmann : Good morning, gentlemen. Just had a few follow-ups. In terms of bank side on the mid-tier, how do you think the prospects for lower interest rates for longer impacts, the willingness for banks to pull the trigger and decide to upgrade a core or do major projects as well, the election, are you seeing anything in terms of decision cycles, may be lengthening or requests in terms of the demands that the banks are looking for from their core providers in order to go ahead and upgrade, has there been a change in their expectation? David Foss : Those are all -- Pete, this is Dave. Those are all definitely topics of conversation, but I don't see any of those things impacting the number of requests for proposal, for example, the number of deals that we have in place right now or the pace of decision that's going on right now. We closed 19 competitive core deals in the fiscal year. That's around the rate that we've had for quite some time, sometimes little over 20, sometimes little under 20, but that's a consistent rate for us. And then the mid-tier space in particular, we feel that we're very well positioned now. You may or may not have seen we did press release recently about the reintroduction may be of SilverLake as a real-time platform with the new user interface that we referenced earlier, the experienced interface. We got a little bit of good press from Talend where they named SilverLake as the new market leader for mid-sized banks. So I think we're feeling very strong about where we're positioned today. But as far as decision, the request for proposals or RFP requests or the decision pace, it hasn't really changed at all in quite some time. Pete Heckmann : All right, that's helpful. And then Kevin, just a clarifying comment on your guidance, you provided a good tight range for EPS. Would there be any material level of buyback implied in that guidance? Kevin Williams : Not a huge amount. As we're predicting there's probably million shares or so in there that we will buy in the first half of the year, so Pete. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Your line is open. DaveKoning: Yes hey guys, nice job. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Dave. Dave Koning : Yes and I guess, first of all, just looking at the margin, if we take out term fees and assume they're 100% margin, it looks like this quarter was I think, the operating margin, a little over 23% and last year Q4, was just under 26% on a ex-term fee basis, so down 240 bps or something like that. Why would margin be down so much year-over-year? Kevin Williams : Well, part of that, Dave, is what I said, the 23% increase in R&D expense, because we didn't capitalize as much software this quarter. And then I would say you that the G&A expense is up because of all the change in everything. We have hired a bunch of accounting people, internal auditors is staffed up during the year, so just several areas primarily in personnel expense that has impacted the margins. Dave Koning : Got you. Yes, I can see D&A was up in almost probably about 100 bps or something in G&A up. It seems like there might be a little bit of core to may be D&A was may be part of it too, just as you're starting to amortize some of the software, I would imagine that's may be a little bit of it too? Kevin Williams : That's a little bit of it, yes. Dave Koning : Okay, okay. And then secondly, just a couple of things on Alogent. Is the margin -- was the margin at Alogent above or below core Jack Henry? Kevin Williams : It was little below. Dave Koning : Little below, okay. And then -- where in, I'm assuming it's in support and services, but what part of support and services was Alogent in? Kevin Williams : Alogent was actually a license and implementation and maintenance. It was basically a toolkit that was sold and then you sold much professional services to build it the way the banks want, which is the way that Tier 1 and international banks do business and that's not the way our typical community bank does business. Dave Koning : Got you. Okay. And then I guess and then finally, just over time now, I know for so many years, free cash flow was above earnings, and that's typically the way, it looks like over time things tend to go. This year was a little below because you've been ramping up. And I know you mentioned to us think of what you're doing right now is instead of buying, making acquisitions, you're investing in your own business and growing really well and everything. How should we think that over time of free cash flow dynamics? Do you think it will be above earnings again as you leverage some of the spending you've been doing? Kevin Williams : Yes. It should be back to this year, Dave. I mean like I said in the opening comments. I mean, our annual maintenance billing collections were behind last year about $10 million. So I mean, if you just throw that in there, that's the difference. And then if you figure CapEx or cap software levels off are down slightly in FY 2017 that was a $19 million increase this year over last year. You put those two numbers in there and you're back way above earnings. Dave Koning : Yes. Okay. And then, I guess finally, when you said cap software should be down slightly in fiscal 2017, is that a combination of capitalized software and that internal use software? Kevin Williams : Yes. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We have another question in the queue from the line of David Togut from Evercore. Your line is open. Rayna Kumar : Good morning, this is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Could you just comment on your expectations for electronic payments growth for FY 2017? It was good to see it pop back up to 8% in the fourth quarter. Kevin Williams : Yes. I think we have well, 8% including deconversion fees. So that's 5% excluding deconversion fees. And I think that's a good run rate for us right now. We have three payments businesses, our Debit Switch, our Bill Pay business and our ACH Remote Deposit business, all of them growing in that 5% to 7% range, let's say, for the coming year. Yes, again, we have this headwind that we're trying to grow over that I mentioned in my opening remarks regarding the two significant customers that we lost last year. David Foss : Which we should -- those will anniversary in the December quarter. Rayna Kumar : Understood. That's very helpful. What are your expectations for R&D growth for 2017? It was up 23% in the quarter, should we expect that to be the new normalized run rate as the capitalized software growth slows down? Kevin Williams : No. I think, the R&D run rate is -- was a little higher than in Q4 than what you can typically expect the run rate. It's going to level back down a little bit going into FY 2017, Rayna. Rayna Kumar : Great, okay. And could we just get the end-of-period share count? Kevin Williams : I do not have that in my fingertips. I apologize. Rayna Kumar : Okay, I'll just shoot you an e-mail. Great. Kevin Williams : It's somewhere around 79.5. Rayna Kumar : 79.5, perfect. Thank you. Kevin Williams : Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And I see no other questioners in the queue at this time. So I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Kevin Williams : Thank you. Again, I want to thank you for joining us today to review our fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2016 results. We are pleased with the results from our ongoing operations and the efforts of all of our associates to take care of our customers. Our executives, managers, and all of our associates continue to focus on what is best for our customers and our shareholders.

(Broker) Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Jack Henry & Associates First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Kevin Williams, CFO. Sir, please go ahead. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thank you, Abigail. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for the Jack Henry & Associates first quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO. And on the call with me today is David Foss, our President and CEO. The agenda for the call this morning, in a minute, I'll turn the call over to Dave. He will provide some of his thoughts about the business and the performance of the quarter. After that, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market closed, and then I'll update our guidance for FY 2017 and for Q2. And then, we will open the line up for Q&A. I need to remind you the remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends, or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong operating quarter with record revenue and operating income. As in the past, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work that went into producing those results for our first fiscal quarter. I'm particularly pleased with the results for the quarter because the prior-year quarter included some fairly significant headwinds for us to grow over. Our Q1 in FY 2016 included both Alogent, which we sold last quarter, and a full quarter revenue associated with Susquehanna as we've discussed on prior calls. Despite these headwinds, total revenue increased 7% for the quarter and increased 6% excluding the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters. Organic revenue growth was also 7% for the quarter. Our payments businesses performed well despite the pressure we highlighted last quarter, and we posted a 7% increase in payments revenue or a 6% increase, excluding deconversion fees. Our outsourcing and cloud revenue growth for the quarter was 19%. And if you exclude the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters, we saw a very solid 14% increase. Despite an extremely strong sales quarter in Q4 of FY 2016, our sales teams finished Q1 in excess of 100% of quota and booked more business than any previous first quarter. This is significant not only because they have set a sales bookings record but because they did it without the benefit of any Alogent sales in this quarter. Additionally, all three of our brands continue to work robust sales pipelines. As I mentioned in the press release, we hosted our two largest client conferences of the year in September and October for our Symitar and JHA Banking brands. Between the two conferences, we hosted more than 44 prospect institutions represented by almost 100 people. I was overwhelmed of both conferences by the levels of customer satisfaction expressed to me by our customers, which in a reference selling business like ours is obviously very helpful. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Dave. Our support and service line of revenue, which represents 97% of our total revenue for the quarter, continues to drive our revenue growth. Our support and services breakdown for the quarter compared to prior year : implementation services of $15.6 million versus $17.1 million was a slight decrease of 9% for the quarter; electronic payments was $135.8 million versus $126.5 million, which is a nice 7% increase as Dave mentioned; OutLink revenue, $83.8 million versus $70.7 million, again increased 19% for the quarter; in-house maintenance, $84.8 million versus $84.3 million, which is a slight increase for the quarter compared to last year; and our bundled services of $12.9 million versus $9.1 million, which is made up of implementation, license, and maintenance with increase of $3.8 million for the quarter. As Dave pointed out, total revenue growth was 7% for the quarter and grew 6% for the quarter if you were back out total deconversion fees of $13.1 million this quarter versus $7.1 million in year-ago quarter. And if you back out the increase in deconversion fees of $6 million over the last year, revenue is still above consensus estimate for the quarter. To look at just current operations and back out the $6.4 million of Alogent revenue in last year's quarter, our revenue from operations grew 9%. And if you adjust for both total deconversion fees and Alogent grow over, revenue grew 8%, which is right in line with the prior-year revenue growth. Our deconversion fees were just slightly higher than we anticipated for the quarter, due to a couple of unknown deconversions that occurred in the quarter, but the big decrease in these fees compared to the prior year that we discussed on the last earnings call is projected to be in the second and fourth quarters, as that is when we had the large one-time deconversion fees from Susquehanna and CIC (5:29) last year. Our growth and operating margins both improved slightly as reported, and remained relatively level if you back out deconversion fees for both years. The effective tax rate decreased to 31.9% for the quarter from 36.1% last year. This decrease is primarily due to the reinstatement of the R&E Credit, which we got the benefit of this year, but we did not have benefit of in the prior-year quarter. And we have the early adoption of ASU 2016-09, which allows you to recognize the benefit of stock-based compensation through the P&L as an adjustment to taxes, which previously, this ran through retained earnings, which the impact from this early adoption was approximately $0.03 EPS. We anticipate the effective tax rate to return to the more normal 34.5% in the second quarter, and wind up for the year between 33.5% and 34%, with the impact of this early adoption. Our net income was up 21% to $62.2 million from $51.4 million a year ago, which led to EPS of $0.79, which was up 24% over last year EPS of $0.64 for the quarter. Excluding the increase in deconversion fees this quarter compared to a year ago, net income would still be up 13%, and EPS up 16%. Therefore, decreased taxes contributed $0.03 to the EPS, and the increase in deconversion fees contributed just a little less than $0.05. So, true adjusted EPS from operations without these impacts was still a little above $0.71, compared to the $0.70 consensus. EBITDA for the quarter increased to $125.7 million compared to $111.9 million last year, or a 12.3% increase. Included in the total amortization disclosed in the press release is the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions, which was down to $3.7 million this quarter compared to $4.8 million last year. Our free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software, plus proceeds from sale of assets, was $101.5 million for the first quarter this year, or $1.29 per share, compared to $86.4 million or $1.07 per share last year. We continue to provide solid return to our shareholders through both dividends of $21.9 million for the quarter and stock buybacks of $61.3 million for the quarter. Our return on equity for the trailing 12 months was a solid 26.8%. For guidance, our revenue growth will continue to be slow in FY 2017 as we continue to grow over the headwinds created by the disposition of Alogent and loss of the two large customers last year that got acquired, and the huge increase in deconversion fees last year that we will grow over this year. For the December quarter, we have $8.2 million of revenue that Alogent contributed in the prior year, and we had our largest payment (8:22) process that was acquired last year, contributing revenue through the end of November in the prior year that we have to grow over both of those. We anticipate deconversion fees to be down $3 million to $5 million in the December quarter compared to previous year, again, because last year, we had the large one-time deconversion fee from Susquehanna. We anticipate revenue growth in the December quarter of roughly in line with the 4% to 4.5% we previously provided on the last earnings call. However, if you were to adjust that for the Alogent and back out the deconversion fees from both periods, our revenue growth from operations would continue to be in the 7% to 8% range in Q2. We anticipate margins will be essentially flat with the same quarter a year ago. And the effective tax rate obviously will be up to 34.5% in the December quarter, up significant from the 29.9% in the quarter last year. However, with all that, we are still comfortable with EPS consensus estimate of $0.74 for the December quarter at this time. That concludes our opening comments, and we are now ready to take questions. Abigail, will you please open the call lines up for questions? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens. Your line is open. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, Brett. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: One question. Kevin, I think you said the OutLink was up 19%. Is that a reflection \u2013 is that where the deconversion fees would show up? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I think Dave mentioned this on his comments. If you back out deconversion fees, it was still up 14% for the year, which is actually pretty much in line with where it was all of last year. Last year, it was 13% back out deconversion fees, Brett. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And then remind us again, you called out one more one-time item. I think the large payment processor year-over-year growth. What was that sort of one-time item again that we need to make sure we're good within December? Can you just reiterate that? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yes, that was Susquehanna, and there was a onetime fee when they deconverted in November of $5 million, which is why I explained there are deconversion fees, but December quarter is going to down $3 million to $5 million from where it was last year. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And then can you give us a sense of how the conversations \u2013 Dave, you mentioned being able to talk to some of the 40 prospects I think or customers and prospects at the recent conferences. As you're talking to those folks and those bankers, any change in tone of what they're looking for? Are they still looking for compliance or cost reduction or revenue enhancement and kind of what are the top things on their list these days? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. And I've talked to most of them I would say at those two conferences. I don't know that I got to every one of them, but generally, it's around improving functionality in the core system, certainly focused on compliance and efficiency. And one of the new solutions we released last year that we've talked about is (11:12). So, that's gaining some traction because it helps a bank or credit union improve efficiency. So, normally, that's around improved overall solution, improved customer service, and then compliance and efficiency. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And then last question from me. Any update on the new digital banking products that are rolling out that I think were associated with Banno or some of that functionality, kind of how was that going and what's the feedback so far? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Feedback has been solid. We've signed, I think not in the quarter but in the past 12 months, we've signed around 90 customers, and I don't have an exact number in front of me, but around 90 customers on the Banno platform. Feedback is good that is the solution that we're building around as far as a digital platform for mobile and webhosting and the entire customer experience, and customer reaction is very solid to that solution. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's what I needed. Thanks, guys. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Heckmann with Avondale. Your line is open. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC : Good morning, gentlemen. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, Pete. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC : Great. So, you've had two consecutive quarters where term fees were much higher, and that's seeing a whole lot of activity in the marketplace as regards M&A. Would you characterize that as just kind of an unlucky coincidence? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well, I would say, Pete, that we knew going into this quarter, like I said in my opening comments, the deconversion this quarter were just slightly higher. We knew of some that were going to happen this quarter. There were a couple kind of surprises that happen as the payments came in, the paperwork came in that we weren't really anticipating. But like I said, we got pretty good visibility next quarter. Obviously, you can always be surprised, but we don't see anything coming up the next quarter even for the (12:57) that surprised us. So, we still think our deconversion fees for the year are going to be down quite a bit from last year primarily because of those two large ones from the Susquehanna and CIC (13:09) that got acquired last year. Just those two, that's about $10 million. So, we still think it's going to be down for the year. We knew it's going to be a little up this quarter. It's just a matter of timing, which we have no control over. We have to recognize revenue when the (13:24) come in, Pete. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC : Yeah. Sure enough. Sure enough. So, that's good though that you expect term fees to be down for the year, and you talked about the second quarter, so that's a positive. Can you give us an update on the M&A pipeline? Are you seeing anything there that looks interesting in terms of allocating some capital towards some smaller growth companies that you could use to complement your core solution? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. This is Dave, Pete. I'd say that the story right now on M&A is pretty much the same story that we've been experiencing for the past 12 months. We are always looking. There are always fields that we have our eye on. It's tough to find a deal that really fits, A, because we have such a broad suite of solutions today, finding something that we don't have that fits who we are and what we're trying to do as a company can be a challenge; and then, B, valuations are still difficult to get something that really fits as far as valuation. So, there are deals that are out there, and we're looking all the time. Just haven't found one recently that fit the profile that we're looking for. Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners LLC : Got it. Got it. Okay. I'll get back in the queue. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is open. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks. Yeah. Hi. I guess, my first question just the payments business on an ex-term fee basis, most of the last year kind of was around 4% growth. In Q1, it's at 6% now. Is there anything changing on an underlying basis that's just getting better? Are you starting to partially anniversary some stuff from Susquehanna or anything else? Because it just seems like momentum is getting better there on an underlying basis. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: No. And, Dave, it's Dave. No, no anniversary as far as Susquehanna is concerned. I think your kind of high-level assessment is correct. The payments business is performing well, performing better frankly than I had expected, and it's really across all three areas. As a reminder, we have three aspects of our payments business. We have our card processing business, our bill pay business, and then our remote deposit capture ACH business. All three of those lines of business are performing well and better than we had anticipated. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And is that a function of market share wins or do you think in part that's just a function of \u2013 I don't know \u2013 a pickup in economic activity or just banks really pushing more for electronic like, I guess, how do you, I guess, parse that? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, I think it's market share wins, and I don't know if it's banks pushing more or us helping them push more. So, we track pretty closely subscriber adoption, for example, in bill pay. And same-store sales growth is a key metric for us, and same-store sales growth is up this year. And we are active in helping our bank and credit union clients with their adoption within \u2013 so, customers that were already signed with us, we help them with adoption for their customers. So, I think there is an uptake across the board, not only in competitive signings but in us helping our customers get to more of their consumers with our payment solutions. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, Dave. I think we mentioned on the last call we continue to have a very solid pipeline in all three of those lines. (16:40) capture the sales we have there. That part still continues to serve us well. But we still got quite a bit of runway in our customer base for the card business. I'd say, obviously, we saw that as much outside the base as we did inside the base. So, there is still some nice runway, and what you're seeing I think is some of the sales that were made last year that are now getting converted, because everybody has those; once you convert them, you're actually bringing some nice volume on. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Got you. Thank you. And then I guess secondly, just the guidance comments you made, I think they were fiscal Q2 when you said 4% to 4.5% revenue growth and margins flat year-over-year. I guess, first of all, am I right about that and then, full year, is it still 4% reported and then with maybe mild margin expansion? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yes. That's exactly what I said. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Got you. And I guess, finally, on the tax rate, the adjustment to your tax rate guidance, is it still somewhat \u2013 like, are there moving parts still around some of the new accounting where, depending on the stock movement, the actual tax rate could still move around a little bit outside of your range, or do you feel pretty good now about the full-year range? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I feel good about it, Dave. And the reason is because most of our stock-based compensation benefit happened in Q1, that's when the long-term comp restricted stock vests for the executives and GMs, in that (18:18) the vast majority of any stock-based benefit is going to happen in Q1. So, there'll be a little bit the rest of the year, but not near as much. So, going into this quarter, we didn't know exactly what the benefit could be, and until we knew that, which was actually in mid-September, that was when we made the decision to go ahead and early adopt to get the benefit. But up until September 10, to be quite honest, we weren't sure if we were going to early adopt or not. So, very comfortable with the tax rate for the balance of the year on the guidance I gave, because the stock-based benefit is not going to have much impact the balance of the year. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got you. All right. Great. Well, thank you. Nice job. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Dave. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Kevin. I want to go back to the fiscal 2017 guide also. So, back in August, you called out two major headwinds was lower deconversion fees, which I think was going to be a $0.10 drag, and the tax rate sort of grow over, which I think was a $0.05 drag. That obviously drove the upside of the quarter, this quarter, sort of the $0.08 that you sort of called out, meaning the deconversion fees, I'm pretty sure, and I think you acknowledged, came in higher than you would have thought in the quarter, and then you got the benefit from the tax rate in the quarter. So how should we be thinking about the flow-through of this quarter's upside into the full-year guide? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, obviously, the $0.03 tax impact for this quarter is going to take the whole year guidance up, Glenn. I mean, there are a couple of deconversion fees that came in this quarter that we kind of anticipated next quarter. So, we're still going to have an overall decrease for the year in deconversion fees. Probably not quite the drag that I anticipated in August, but it's still probably going to be a $0.07 or $0.08 drag to the year. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): So, all else equal, we should probably looking at $3.10 in EPS kind of thing? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: That is probably about right. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): And then on the deconversion fees, it certainly sounded like it was somewhat unexpected, and it seemed like a pretty big deconversion fee. So, what happened, and how should we be thinking about when that potential revenue drag is going to hit you? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Actually, Glenn, the Q1 deconversion fees wasn't that much of a surprise, and I tried to get that across (20:45) comments. I mean, we knew deconversion fees this quarter were going to be up compared to last quarter. The surprise was only like $1 million or $1.5 million of the total deconversion fees for the quarter that came in kind of unexpectedly. So, we knew it was going to be up this quarter, but we also knew it's going to be down quite a bit next quarter. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. So, in your mind \u2013 (21:08) so this was nothing incredibly unusual in the quarter as it relates to the term fees? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: No, absolutely not. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): They're not going to be a meaningful headwind that you're going to be calling out at some point within the next three, four quarters kind of thing? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: No. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): And the credit union business, which had just been humming along and all of a sudden slowed to like 3% growth, anything that explains that, and kind of (21:28) banking got a lot better. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well, a couple of things there, Glenn. I mean, if you look at last year, the comp we had, credit unions had a 32% increase last year in Q1. So, pretty tough comp to grow over. There was nothing really unusual. I mean, everything kind of keeps trucking along. Our bundling revenue was down a little bit this quarter compared to a year ago, just because of the timing of delivery. Some of the implementation was down, just again due to timing of billing and revenue recognition. License and hardware, both down slightly and that's again just due to timing of delivery. So, there is nothing unusual in credit unions other than a very tough comp a year ago. Banking, everything is continuing to track along, especially the outsourcing, which is relevant to the in and out business that we continue to talk about and continue to see a very good momentum there as we see that shift of our existing (22:26) customers moving to outsourcing, and I think we're going to continue to see that nice growth especially in the outsourcing and payments businesses in both sides of the business. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): All right. Great. Thanks a lot. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning. This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. It's good to see the capitalized software down for the quarter. Could you just talk about your expectations for FY 2017 as a whole? And separately, could you just talk about any major product investments you're making currently? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: So, I talked about this a little bit on the last call that we expect that CapEx is down a little bit, the cap software is down a little bit, and I expect cap software to run at that same rate going forward. As far as the new products that are in process or maybe capitalized software projects that are in process, we have the ongoing Episys technology development that we've talked about on several calls in the past that goes on through 2018 but is being rolled out in phases. So, it's not that it's a big bang at the end, but it's an ongoing project for us. We've highlighted our treasury management project that's been going on that is released next year. We have a financial crime solution that we've been working on that we have talked about previously and then other ongoing projects with our payments business, for example, and with Banno that was already asked about today. So, a number of large development projects that are ongoing. But with that said, as I said earlier, I expect cap software to kind of run at the same rate that you are seeing now. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: And I'll also say we rolled a lot of products out in the June quarter and into live production (24:14) which drove to the increase in amortization that you see in the press release that flowed through (24:20) the cash flow statement this quarter. So, our percentage of cap software that's still in development is not being amortized, is running pretty much where it has been historically. And as Dave said, our cap software for the year, as we guided last quarter, is going to be down for the year. Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : That's very helpful. Could you discuss your business pipeline for electronic payments and your expectations for revenue growth for the year? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Sure. I think I said the expectation on the last call that we'd be in the 5% to 6% range. And if you look at this quarter, excluding deconversions, we are right at 6%. I think that's a good number going forward in the 5% to 6% range. The payments business, as I talked about earlier with one of the questions, is performing nicely for us right now. We have some grow over that we're dealing with from last year, but the payments, all three lines of the payments business are performing well right now. Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : With the strong top line growth and EPS gains, I was a little surprised to see your operating cash flow up only 5%. Was there any onetime items or anything in the cash flow that we should be aware of maybe in working capital? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: No, not really. Nothing unusual. Obviously, deferred revenue is up quite a bit from a year ago, and that's probably the biggest change right there that caused the increase not to go up anymore. I mean, that's a $12 million increase which is actually a good thing. Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Got it. Okay. And one final question from me. Could you just discuss the competitive environment in the large credit union space, and specifically, are you seeing any increased competition from Fiserv's DNA product? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I would describe the competitive environment as intense as it has been in the large credit union space, intense as it has been for quite some time. No, we are not seeing any increased level of competition or reason to be concerned when it comes to any particular core provider. We're all competing. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: And like Dave said, we have a large number of core prospects at our Symitar Educational Conference. I believe there was 28 (26:40). David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: 28 and half of those were over $1 billion in assets. Let me point out too that in the last fiscal year, so I don't have the number for this quarter, but in the last fiscal year, for us, so July 1 to June 30, there were 12 credit unions that made a competitive decision \u2013 over $500 million in assets,12 credit unions that made a competitive decision, meaning leave their current core provider. 50% of those went with our Symitar solution. So, I think that's a good indicator of how we're positioned today as a core provider against any of the cores that are out there. Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Hey. Good morning, Dave and Kevin. Dave, you talked a little bit about how sales have been fairly strong, and I know, Kevin, you don't give backlog numbers anymore, but if you look at the visibility based on what you have already in the pipeline, how far can you see out? I mean, is demand strong enough that, over the next two fiscal years, you feel fairly good that you'll be able to maintain a fairly decent organic growth rate? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Let me touch on that first, and then I'll turn it over to Kevin. I think it depends on the product line that you're looking at. So, you sign a new core deal today. Well, that core deal isn't going to install for 12 to 14 months. You never know what their conversion timeline is, but it's a long-term project. Whereas you sign a bill pay customer today, they may convert in 60 days. So, it really depends on the product line that you're talking about, and given the fact that we're pretty diverse today when it comes to product signings, I think that's a difficult question for me to answer. Now, Kevin may have a better response. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. I guess, Kartik, what I'd say is, with our recurring revenue at 80%, with the backlog of conversions that we know we have out there for, not only payments, but also the customers that have signed contracts to move from in to out, so we know the conversion timelines for those and what that benefit's going to do to revenue. So, we got very good visibility for at least 12 months to 18 months out, barring any large M&A activity where we lose another customer just like we did last year, but barring that, we got extremely good visibility, probably 95% plus of what we're going to have for the next 12 to 18 months. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Hey, Kevin. You and David talked about core systems. Are you seeing \u2013 has demand increased for banks and credit unions looking at core systems, potentially replacing them or doing some kind of analysis? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I don't know that I would characterize it as any significant increase. There are a lot of deals in flight (29:37) right now, and as always, our biggest competitor is no decision, right, if people go out and look and then they decide to not make a move for whatever reason. So, I don't know that there's some great big increase overall. At this point in time, there are a lot of deals that are in play. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. I would say this, the good indicator is having record attendance at your education conferences, record number of prospects, and we even had a record number of CEOs at our CEO forum, at our Banking Education Conference. So, those are all really good indications. And I would say that's surprising, because there was a large number of the CEOs actually stuck around this year and went to the technology fair to look at some of our products. So, to me, those are all very good indications that we're going to continue to do well. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : And then just last question, just your use of cash, Kevin. I think, Dave, you said that, on the M&A side, really there hasn't been any product that you've been really attracted to, and maybe the multiples are too high. From a use of cash, is it, Kevin, going to be just buying back shares like you have, or are there other things you're thinking about? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, obviously, we're going to continue to look at M&A activity (30:57). As Dave said, there's just not a lot out there, which is why we continue to reinvest in our products and develop products. We have our Annual Shareholders Meeting this week on Thursday and our board meeting. And just like every board meeting, we're going to discuss the use of cash, but anticipate that we'll probably continue to use to buy back stock and continue to evaluate increasing dividends. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Thank you very much. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And we have a follow-up from the line of David Koning with Baird. Your line is open. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my second one. So, you talked a little bit about \u2013 I know capitalized software, down this year. I know you talked about that. CapEx, did you say what you expect? I know last year was $56 million. That's also going to be down this year? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I mean, as of now, we think it is, Dave. (31:51) depending on upgrades to hardware and some different things, but we don't have any large, unusual CapEx, other than maintenance, really planned for this year. In the following years, very possible we're going to have to add another building in Springfield because we are out of space there. We're back to leasing almost as much space as we did before. We built two buildings in 2010 and more to come on that, but the CapEx should be flat to down slightly through the year. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got you. What it seems like is happening, I know last year was a little different than the norm that free cash flow was a little below earnings. After 10 years in a row, I think it was above. It feels like given CapEx going down despite the overall growth of your business, it just seems like you might revert and kind of catch-up this year, not only be above earnings but kind of pick up the little bit of gap that you had last year, so be more above earnings than normal. Does that seem like a fair statement? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I don't know how (32:52) about confirming that, but I think it would be back above earnings, yes. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Well, thank you for that. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Dave. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Kevin Williams for further remarks. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Again, I want to thank you all for joining us today to review our first quarter fiscal 2017 results. We're very pleased with results from our ongoing operations and the efforts of all of our associates to take care of our customers. Our executive managers and all of our associates continue to focus on what is best for our customers and our shareholders. I want to thank you again for joining us today.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Williams. You may begin. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thank you, Michelle. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for the Jack Henry & Associates second quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings call. I am Kevin Williams, CFO, and on the call with me today is, David Foss, our President and CEO. The agenda for the call this morning, in a minute, I'll turn it over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the business, industry, and performance of the quarter. And then, I'll provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market closed, and I'll update guidance for FY 2017 and then, we will open the lines up for questions. I need to remind you the remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends, or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release, and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. I'll now turn the call over to, Dave. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong operating quarter with record revenue and operating income. As in the past, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work that went into producing those results for our second fiscal quarter. As we discussed in the previous call, we divested our Alogent division at the end of last fiscal year, and we still had Susquehanna in the mix through November. So the comparable quarter includes a slight headwind for revenue growth. Despite that headwind, total revenue increased 5% for the quarter, organic revenue growth was 7% for the quarter. In line with the guidance we have provided on previous calls, our payments businesses posted a 5% increase in revenue, excluding the impact of deconversion fees. Our outsourcing and cloud revenue growth for the quarter was 17%, and if you exclude the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters, we saw a very solid 13% increase. Our sales team saw a good success in the quarter with a few of the strategic solutions we've discussed in the past. They signed 11 new Hosted Network Services or HNS deals in the quarter, which is almost as many as they signed in all of FY 2016. Additionally, they signed 27 Banno Mobile contracts, and secured the first agreements for our new treasury management solution, and our new enterprise risk mitigation solution. As I mentioned in the press release, 2016 was our 40th anniversary year, and we hosted a number of events throughout the year to celebrate that milestone with our associates, customers, and partners. We cap that year of celebration with a bell-ringing event at NASDAQ in November. Thank you again, to all those who helped us celebrate this significant anniversary. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Dave. Support and Service line of revenue, which represents 97% of our total revenue for the quarter continues to drive our revenue growth. Our Support and Services breakdown for the quarter compared to the prior year was; our implementation services was $13.7 million for the quarter versus $15.9 million or a decrease of 13% for the quarter; electronic payments was $131.5 million versus $130.5 million, an increase of 1%, or as Dave mentioned, a 5% net of deconversion fees. Our OutLink or our outsource delivery model was $84.6 million versus $72.1 million, which is a 17% increase for the quarter, and again 13%, very strong growth net of deconversion fees. Our in-house maintenance was $83.8 million versus $83.4 million or just a slight increase, and then bundled services, which is the implementation, license and maintenance revenue combined with those bundled product was $23.8 million versus $18.4 million a year ago. As Dave pointed out, our total revenue grew 5% for the quarter, and close to 6%, if you were to back out deconversion fees of $8.5 million this quarter versus $10.4 million a year-ago quarter. Backing out the $8.2 million of Alogent revenue in last year's second quarter, along with the impact of these deconversion fees, our revenue from operations actually grew 8%, which is consistent with prior-year revenue growth. Also, the Banking segment, revenue grew 8%, but if you back out deconversion fees and Alogent revenue in last year's quarter in the Banking segment, revenue in that segment grew 11%. Credit Union segment was down 4% this year, however, if you back out the deconversion fees, revenue was up slightly, and this is compared to a very tough comp last year, when revenue in the Credit Union segment was up 28% in last year's quarter. Year-to-date Banking segment revenue is up a little over 10%, and backing out the impact of deconversion fees and Alogent, and Credit Union segment was up 2%, again a very tough comp last year, when the CU segment was up 25% for the first-half of FY 2016. Our growth in operating margins remained relatively level with prior year. The effective tax rate increased to 33.5% for the quarter from 29.9% last year. This increase was primarily due to the reinstatement of the R&E Credit in the second quarter of FY 2016, which included four quarters of the R&E Credit. Because of the change in the tax rate, our net income was down 1% to $58.8 million from $59.3 million a year ago, which led the EPS of $0.75 for the quarter. So look at true operations by backing out the impacts of Alogent, deconversion fees and the change in the tax rate, our net income would've increased 10% and EPS 12% for the quarter. EBITDA for the quarter increased to $124.0 million compared to $116.7 million last year. Included in the total amortization disclosed in the press release is amortization of intangibles from acquisitions, which was down to $3.6 million this year compared to $4.7 million last year. Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx and less cap software, plus proceeds from sale of assets, was $94.2 million for the first six months or $1.20 per share compared to $62.1 million or $0.78 per share last year. We continue to provide a solid return to our shareholders through dividends of $21.9 million and stock buybacks of $61.3 million during the quarter. Year-to-date, we've deployed our capital by investing $70 million back in our company through CapEx and development products, and we've returned $147 million to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. Our return on equity for the trailing 12 months has been 26.8%. A little update on guidance, our revenue growth will continue to be slow in FY 2017 as we grow over the headwinds created by the disposition of Alogent, and the loss of two large customers during FY 2016 that we will grow over this year, remember, we lost another large customer in May of last year. For the March quarter, we have the $7.7 million of revenue that Alogent contributed last year that we left over. We anticipate revenue growth in the March quarter are roughly in line with the 4% to 4.5% we previously provided on the last earnings call. We anticipate the margins will be essentially flat with the same quarter a year ago, and the effective tax rate should approximately be the same as last year. We are comfortable with the EPS consensus estimate of $0.72 for the March quarter at this time. That concludes our opening comments, and we are now ready to take questions. Michelle, will you please open the call lines for questions? Operator : Yeah. Our first question comes from Brett Huff of Stephens, Inc. Your line is open. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Quick question on the Banking segment. Obviously, really good performance there. Can you just sort of deconstruct that for us, and was there a particular driver, a big win, a go-live or anything like that, that drove that particularly strong performance? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Not really, Brett. I mean, a couple of things, I mean, one, obviously outsourcing continues to be extremely strong. It's 18% for the quarter in the Banking segment, which if you back out the deconversion fees, it is still 13% or 14%, and that's becoming a larger part of our business. Payments in the Banking side was up nicely, it was up 8% or 9% for the quarter, just good performance, just overall strong \u2013 and then, obviously, bundled services was up a little bit in the Banking segment. I mean, that just comes from the delivery of the final product in a bundled arrangement. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Dave, you mentioned that you \u2013 it sounds like you guys have been obviously working developmental wise on your cash management or your treasury management solution, you call that out in your Analyst Day. And it sounds like you're having deep enough conversations with folks that you're already starting to sign some contracts. Can you give us how those conversations are going, number one, and what it is that people are finding appealing about your offering? And then number two, can you just give us your thoughts about that market in particular, how you think it grows, what you think the competition looks like? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Sure. We actually highlighted two different solutions at the Analyst Day. So we have a cash management solution and a treasury management solution. Our corporate cash management solution designed for mid-sized businesses, treasury management designed for larger businesses, pretty different as far as functionality and pricing model, and all that kind of stuff. We rolled out the cash management application last \u2013 six months ago or so. I think, we have 29 or 30 contracts signed there already on the cash management solution, again designed for mid-sized businesses. Treasury management is a big deal for us, because we started that from scratch, and we were trying to figure out how to address the needs of the larger customers out there, not just our core customers, but this will be a ProfitStars solution, so we can go, sell to any of the larger core customers, and there is \u2013 and what drove us to do that was a recognition in the \u2013 mid-tier banking space meaning $1 billion to $30 billion space that there weren't great solutions out there to be had, and there is a demand for that type of industry-leading kind of newer technology solution, so we started that initiative a couple of years ago. As I mentioned, we just signed our first customer. We won't go live for few months here, but we're getting some very good feedback, and lot of discussions going on around that product today, so I think there is definitely demand out there. There are several products out there in the treasury management space. Most of them have been around for quite a while, and that's where this demand is coming from, with banks focusing more intently on developing commercial customer relationships, particularly with the larger commercial customers. There is a demand for that solution. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, as you guys talk to banks, this is bigger picture question. As you talk to banks and Trump has been elected, and we're all \u2013 the banks are all hoping for some deregulation. What are you hearing from them on that front, kind of what's their temperature and have you seen them change their discussion topics with you or spending priorities with you as a result of that? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: The conversation has definitely been interesting lately, I don't know that we've seen any significant changes yet, as far as indications on spending, I will point out that, just yesterday, I got the latest Cornerstone Advisors' note, I forget the title, oh, What's Going on in Banking. And in that, they surveyed 301 bank and credit union executives in December, so it's new news, it's post-election, and they highlighted exactly what we've been hearing that the banks in particular, and credit unions for that matter perceiving an improving economy in 2017, rising interest rates, so I think everybody is tuned into, regulatory rollbacks are expected, how extreme or how deep those will go, nobody knows. I think, the focus of the conversation right now has been around bankers' desire for just some clarity, there's so much speculation, so much debate about what might happen, they're looking for some clarity right now. But generally, the feeling is pretty good about 2017, and what the impact of the new administration will have on banks in general. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Great. That's all I need. Thanks, guys. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Brett. Operator : Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Hey. Good morning, Dave and Kevin. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Yeah \u2013 just to maybe add on to what you were saying about 2017, and banks feeling better. Any thoughts on what that might mean in terms of consolidation or implication of consolidation, would you anticipate consolidation increasing or do you anticipate kind of staying where we are, the rate where we're going right now? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, there's two sides of that coin, it's a good question, and it's one that we kind of debate a lot with different bankers out there, because on the one side, if there is a reduction in regulation and interest rates go up, it's \u2013 maybe more a fun to be a banker in 2017, and so you may see some bankers continue to stay, who maybe were thinking about selling. The other side of that coin is, bank stocks are up overall, and this idea that it's a good time to be in banking may drive more acquisition on the flipside of that, just because bank stocks are up, I'm looking to cash in, sell my bank and there are plenty of acquisitive mid-tier banks in particular out there. So I don't know that I expect any great change in 2017 on the M&A front. But it is an interesting time right now, because of this perception that it will be a better year to be in banking in 2017. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: The other thing that will be interesting, Kartik is, depending on which regulations get eased, if it becomes less burdensome for a bank to break the $10 billion threshold, I mean, there's a lot of mid-tier banks out there that have held back because they didn't want to pass over that threshold unless they could jump way over it. So depending on the regulations that \u2013 it could change some of that, I think, thought process out there too. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Kevin, as of now, what kind of impact has consolidation had on your revenue, and if you look over the last, maybe 10 years, is it about the same or is it less? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: It's probably about the same, Kartik, I mean, our banks are buying just like other vendors are buying ours. We've gotten pretty good at winning some mergers, even though, we were not the incumbent from the acquirer, which \u2013 that has helped on \u2013 especially on some mid-tier deals. And then also, as we've gotten more and more of our FIs that are now outsourced, when they are the acquirers, that's a nice uptick in revenue where if an in-house customer buys another FI, we don't see much impact. So it's kind of been net neutral, I mean, obviously the two large ones we lost last year, so we felt both of those, but all-in-all, it's pretty much just business as usual. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I think, Kartik, let me highlight one thing that Kevin said there, I don't recall that we've talked about this in the past, but he referenced winning a merger, we actually call win a merger, that's been a successful strategy for us, so you have an acquirer who's running somebody else's core, acquiring one of our banks and we get into the mix and convince the acquirer to convert to the acquiree's core system which is a Jack Henry core system. So that kind of helps us offset some of those potential losses when we can win a merger. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : And then just one last question. Kevin, just use of cash, obviously you don't have much debt on the balance sheet, but I think, in the past you've said, hey, acquisitions have been expensive, I don't know where you stand today in terms of acquisition versus buyback versus increasing dividend or just keeping the money on the balance sheet? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well, I mean I always start with, we'd love to do an acquisition, we continue to look for them out there. I actually talked to a banker earlier this week, an investment banker, and he thinks that there's probably going to be some properties come out this year, so obviously we'll continue to look for those. We think that, that's the best way to get return for our shareholders to do the right acquisition. Barring that, we'll continue to look at the stock buybacks when it makes sense, we'll also look to continue increasing dividends, which I'm sure this will be a topic for our Board Meeting later this week. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Kartik. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks, and good morning. Two questions. First \u2013 and I apologize if you said this in opening comments, I jumped on it \u2013 I've been too late, but just any update around the network management solution? I know it's still probably relatively small part of the story, but I know it's had some pretty good traction initially, just any updates there? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. I had actually talked about in my opening comments. We signed 11 in the quarter, which \u2013 and I compare that to all of FY 2016, so we signed almost as many in the quarter as we signed in all of FY 2016. So definitely some uptick there, and in fact, we signed two non-Jack Henry core customers, so like we've done with some other solutions, we start out inside the Jack Henry core base with the intent of delivering eventually as a ProfitStars solution, meaning we sell to any core customer, so we signed two non-Jack Henry cores in the quarter and nine Jack Henry cores in the quarter, we have 30 FIs live, so a combination of banks and credit unions, and what we're finding is, it's been really interesting. A lot of our customers will sign with part of their network infrastructure and kind of see how it goes and get used to the idea of outsourcing, then they'll come back and say, okay, now we want to add the rest, or you know we want to add another component. So a good traction on that front. Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great, thank you. And then, just another question, I know there was a question earlier about like, bank spending and product discussions. Could you talk about, I guess margin profiles within just broad sort of descriptions of your products? I know there are sort of regulatory-focused products, security, retail banking, something you might call growth orientated spending decisions. If bankers start to reallocate how they spend that IT dollar, is there potentially a margin shift, that would occur one way or the other based upon what they start buying over the next couple of years? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I don't know that you've seen most of the margin shift. I mean, one thing I'll say, I mean, I think that they're going to continue to spend more on digital and on mobile, which obviously there's some good margins there. One of the byproducts of ease in regulations is our R&D resources can be used to develop products that we can actually sell and make revenue rather than spending all the time, making sure we're compliant with new regulations. So that potentially drives some margin down the road, it won't immediately as we have additional products to sell. But I don't know that we'll see much of this, I mean, maybe a little as they move into different areas, but I just don't see \u2013 I don't think you'll see it in our financials. Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just last one. Again, Dave, I apologize if this was made in your opening comments. I caught the tail-end of the discussion around payments. But I know you guys do your user group meetings, get a lot of feedback from your various groups you work with. Could you gauge or sort of \u2013 just sort of what the response to the payment strategies, the treasury management has looked like versus maybe other internal initiatives that were several years in the making? Is this more enthusiastic sort of in line with those other successes or is there something here that you sense maybe a stronger response than you'd seen with other types of situations like this? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well, depending on the product that we roll out, Tim, the buyer for the product we roll out can vary dramatically sometimes, right? So the buyer for a treasury management solution is very different from the buyer for a risk or HNS for example. So it's a little bit hard to kind of compare and contrast. But specific to treasury management, there is some real \u2013 2017, treasury management's been around forever. I never imagined that I'd be sitting here talking about a newly-developed treasury management solution. But there is this angst or concern out there that most of the solutions have been around for quite a while, technology is a little aged, which means it's not making it \u2013 the technology they're running today isn't making it easier for the commercial business, and so our bankers in this day of \u2013 everything, everywhere, on every platform, our bankers are looking for solutions that they can put in the hands of their larger commercial customers that will make their life easier, the commercial customers' life easier and they believe just knowing what's going on in technology today, that there are opportunities to do that, that will help them solidify those commercial customer relationships and of course for banks that are in commercial lending and so on, that's a key part of their strategy. So I think, it's being driven around the fact that most of the solutions out there have been around for quite some time and people are just looking for something new and fresh that they can demonstrate to their commercial customers. They have the new \u2013 the new shiny object and something that will deliver them a lot more functionality than what they've had in the past. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: No. I will say, Tim, that there is quite an excitement about our Banno offering. Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : For sure. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: That there's a lot of excitement about that, and mobile's been around for a while. And so, to come out with this new solution and to see the excitement we've seen around that, has been very exciting. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: But the key on that is, that's a single platform. So as opposed to just being a mobile banking deliverable, it's a platform that will \u2013 that does \u2013 it includes marketing, it includes bill pay, it includes mobile check capture, I mean, it's a complete suite of solutions as opposed to a point solution that only does mobile banking. That's what's really creating the enthusiasm around Banno. Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Sounds great. Thank you so much. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Tim. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Ciura of R. W. Baird. Your line is open. Eric Ciura - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Nice job this quarter. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Eric Ciura - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: First on payments revenue growth, now that we've kind of lapped the client loss of Susquehanna, can that start to accelerate again into the high-single-digits? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I think, the guidance for first half, Susquehanna was a significant player for us across the board, not strictly in the payment side of our business. They were a major customer for us across the board. So if we specifically talk about payments, the guidance that I've provided in the past is somewhere in the 5% range, I think that's still a good number go-forward, Susquehanna wasn't that huge a contributor that it's going to all of a sudden bump our payments comp by 2% or something like that. So I still think 5%, in that range is a reasonable expectation. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: And let me just point out, when we talked about Susquehanna, not only were they a good contributor of revenue, but we also had a huge early deconversion fee from them in this quarter last year, which is why we predicted deconversion fees will be down for the quarter. Susquehanna, their total revenue was less than 1%, which is spread across a lot of different revenue lines. So for them \u2013 to just losing them to see a significant uptick in payments, you're not going to see it, it was just kind of an overall drag on our revenue. Eric Ciura - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then, secondly, in the Credit Union segment, term fees were down, but gross margins are actually up slightly year-over-year. So I guess, what was the driver of that? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: There's couple of things, one very good cost control on that side, and very good \u2013 we got rid of some contractors, and did some different things over there, but then also probably one of the biggest things was our card pass through costs were significantly lower this quarter than were a year ago quarter, and that's the EMV cards that we passed through, which obviously we have very little margin on those, so that was one of the big drivers. Eric Ciura - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Eric. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. I missed the beginning of the call, so I apologize for some of these questions. But Kevin, what did you say on the outlook in terms of revenue and earnings growth? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: No change. Basically, Glenn, I mean, revenue is going to grow, because the headwinds of Alogent is going to grow 4% to 4.5% for Q3, and we're comfortable with the consensus estimate of $0.72 out there, right now. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And did you comment for the full year as well? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: No. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Are you comfortable with the... Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I don't see much change for the full year from what we saw back then. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And can you just give us an update on where you are from on [end-out] conversions year-to-date, and takeaway that's what you've done year-to-date in both and Banking and CU? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I don't know that I have [end-outs] for the quarter, I know that we did seven year-to-date. I don't think I have that number, handy. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I got it. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: It's in my office. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: 12 year-to-date. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: To out? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: . Yeah. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: And what about competitively on the takeaways? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Six in the quarter, 18, 19 year-to-date in competitive takeaways. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, on the deconversions, like, I guess, it was pretty small on the quarter for the term fees, but anything we should be thinking about or that you're aware of going forward in upcoming quarters? Any specific headwinds? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: No. I mean, the biggest headwind, Glenn, is still the Alogent revenue that we had in the second half of last year that is not there this year. Then also the loss of CIT in May last year, we lost that revenue, and also the deconversion fees from that, that was in Q4. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: But, nothing new beyond those two? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: No. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks guys. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Kevin Williams for any closing remarks. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Michelle. First of all, I'd like to mention that our 2017 Analyst and Investor Day event will be held on May 8 at the Westin Property at the Denver, Colorado Airports, where we had last year, which makes it very easy for everyone to fly in and out. Presentations will be given by all the executives, our Division Presidents, those will be on Monday afternoon, like we did last year, followed by a reception and a mini check fair to highlight some of our products.

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Jack Henry & Associates Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference may be recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Michelle. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the Jack & Associates Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer; and with me today on the call is David Foss, our President and CEO. The agenda for the call this morning is typical. In just a few minutes, I'll turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the state of the business, the performance of the quarter. Then I'll provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market closed. I'll update our guidance for the remainder of FY 2017, and then we'll open the line up for Q&A. First of all, I need to remind you, the remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends, or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statements about the future, these are subject to a number of factors, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong operating quarter with record revenue and operating income. As in the past, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work that went into producing those results for our third fiscal quarter. As we've discussed previously, we divested our Alogent division at the end of last year, so the comparable quarter includes a headwind for revenue growth. Total revenue growth \u2013 total revenue increased 6% for the quarter, and increased 7% excluding the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters, and excluding Alogent revenue from the prior-year quarter. Organic revenue growth was also 6% for the quarter. All three key areas of our payments business were up this quarter, which led to a 10% increase in revenue, and a 7% increase excluding the impact of deconversion fees. Our outsourcing and cloud revenue growth for the quarter was 16%; and if you exclude the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters, we saw a very solid 11% increase. All of our sales teams had an outstanding third quarter, finishing at a combined 119% of quota. The core teams closed 13 new core deals and, when we talk about new core deals, they're always competitive takeaways. And as we announced last week, the Symitar team has already set an all-time record for the largest number of new $1 billion-plus credit union clients signed in a single year with six, and we still have a couple of months to go in the year. We also saw solid success with several of our key strategic solutions, like HNS, Banno, CECL, Treasury Management, and our new Enterprise Risk Mitigation Solution. As you should all know, we'll be hosting our Annual Analyst Conference in Denver on Monday of next week. Kevin and I will be your hosts, along with all of the three of the brand presidents and several of our general managers. Additionally, Jack and a couple of our board members will be joining us for the day. We hope to see you in Denver. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Dave. Our support and service line revenue, which represents 97% of our total revenue for the quarter, continues to drive our revenue growth. Our support and services breakdown for the quarter compared to the prior year; implementation services was $12.4 million versus $15.9 million, or down 22% for the quarter, basically due to timing, and also remember the implementation (3:55) revenue, the majority of it is now included in the bundled revenue line. Our electronic payments was $133 million versus $121.4 million, as Dave mentioned, up 10% for the quarter, or 7% net of deconversion fees. OutLink was up nicely to $88.6 million from $76.5 million. In-house maintenance was essentially flat at $79.8 million compared to $80.6 million. And our bundled services, which again is implementation, license and maintenance revenue combined for bundled services related to (4:27) was $29 million compared to $25.3 million, so up a little bit. Our total revenue grew 6% for the quarter. Backing out the $7.7 million of Alogent revenue in last year's third quarter, along with the impact of the deconversion fees in both periods of $11.9 million this year and $5.2 million last year, our revenue from operations grew 7%, which is consistent with prior-year revenue growth. Our year-to-date revenue is up 6% \u2013 sorry. Our gross margins were relatively level with the prior year, and gross profit grew 6%, in line with revenue growth. However, if you back out the impacts of Alogent in the third quarter last year and deconversion fees in both quarters, our gross profit would've grown roughly 4.5%, and if deconversion fees would've remained just level with last year instead of going up, (5:18) our gross profit would've been \u2013 would've grown approximately 8%. Our operating margins remained relatively level with the prior year, and making the same adjustment for Alogent deconversion fees has about the same impact on operating income growth as it did on gross profit. The effective tax rate remained relatively flat for the quarter compared to last year, and up just slightly from the year-ago date. Net income is up 11% to $60 million, from $53.9 million a year ago, which led to EPS of $0.77 for the quarter, up from $0.68 a year ago. Without the deconversion fee impact increase from a year ago, our EPS would have been relatively in line with consensus estimates. Our EBITDA for the quarter increased to $124 million, compared to $112 million last year. Included in this whole amortization disclosed in the press release is the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions, which is down to $3.6 million this quarter compared to $4.7 million a year-ago quarter. Our free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software plus proceeds from sold assets, was $95.4 million for the first nine months, or $1.22 per share, compared to $81.7 million, or $1.03 per share, last year. We continue to provide a solid return to shareholders through dividends of $22.1 million during the quarter. Year-to-date, we deployed our capital by investing $106.7 million back into our company through CapEx and development products, and returned $171.5 million to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. Our return on equity for the trailing 12 months is 26.4%. Guidance for Q4 : Our revenue growth will continue to be slowed in FY 2017, as we grow over the headwinds created by the disposition of Alogent, also due to an anticipated significant decrease in deconversion fees for the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. For the June quarter, we have the $6.1 million of revenue that Alogent contributed last year that we have to grow over, and we anticipate a decline of approximately $8. 5 million in deconversion fees from the $15 million we saw in the fourth quarter a year ago. Therefore, we anticipate reported revenue growth to be roughly 1% to 2% compared to prior year actual, which adjusts for Alogent and the decline in deconversion fees will be in line with previous guidance at approximately 5%. We anticipate our margins will remain solid in the fourth quarter with possibly some slight improvement, and the effective tax rate will increase slightly from last year to approximately 34%. The EPS estimate currently out there consensus assessment is $0.85 for the June quarter. Due to the timing of deconversion fees in the third quarter, we think that's probably high. We think probably that (08:07) needs to be trimmed by a couple of pennies down to $0.83. However, that will still make us at $3.14 for the fiscal year, which is still higher than the current consensus assessment and higher than original estimates going into FY 2017. Also, just a reminder, last year's fourth quarter included the gain from the sale of Alogent, which caused a $0.22 impact on EPS in last year's fourth quarter. That concludes our opening comments. With that, we're now ready to take questions. Michelle, will you please open the call lines up for questions? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Morning. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Morning. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Two quick questions. One, Dave, you went through some of the payments numbers. Can you break that down any more? I think you guys \u2013 did you, sometimes gives like Bill Pay versus some of the other different sub lines there? Any detail there? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I don't know that I've gone into a whole lot more detail in the past. But both \u2013 the three areas in our payments business, our Bill Pay, our cards business, and our ACH Origination remote deposit capture business \u2013 ACH Origination remote deposit capture being the same business. So, both cards and Bill Pay were up around 6% to 7%, and the ACH business was up closer to 13% as far as revenue for the quarter. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: And how is the competitive dynamic in that card business? I know sometimes, on the debit side, things can get kind of competitive depending on which competitor is in there. Have a lot of those renewals and the price compression from that kind of come and gone, or is that the consistent thing, or kind of what \u2013 what should we expect on that front? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, it's always a topic, but I don't think the pressure is nearly as intense as it was a year or two ago when it comes renewals on the cards side. But it's always a topic. It's always there. It's something that all of us in that space deal with every time a renewal comes up. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And then my other question was on the Commercial Cash Management and Treasury Management business, that sounds like an exciting piece of software you've got going. I think last call, you gave us a sort of year-to-date or maybe since-inception numbers, and I wondered if you could just go through those and how many more we maybe have knocked down this quarter? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well, I think what I talked about in more detail last time was the fact that we were going into beta in March with that product, and that's \u2013 it's been a long project. We had originally targeted March of this year for beta. We met that timeline. So, we delivered that to beta in March. The bank, I believe, is going live. It's probably today or tomorrow, the first beta bank. And so, I don't know that I have the exact count in front of me as far as how many we signed in the quarter. I can maybe look while we move on, Brett. And at the worst case, I'll have it for you on Monday at the Analyst Conference. But we've signed, it's some \u2013 probably 8 or 10 so far, Treasury Management \u2013 new Treasury Management customers. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. For those of you that will be at the Analyst Day on Monday, Treasury Services, that new product, is one of the products that will be at the mini tech fair Monday evening. So, you'll have a chance \u2013 an opportunity to see it. That, along with our Enterprise Risk Mitigation Solution, which is one where we partnered with SAS, (11:37) our Banno digital offering, our Biller Direct offering, and our ARC (11:44) predictive analytics, will all be there, with product specialists to show those products off, for those of you that are coming to the Analyst Day. So, just another enticement to get you to come to Denver. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: And then last question from me. Just, Dave, unseating some of the incumbents in that treasury management, I think that's a difficult sale to sometimes make. What is the \u2013 what are you hearing from banks that's sort of encouraging you to pursue this so aggressively? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, the reason that we pursued it in the first place, and I said to some folks, I never imagined \u2013 we started this project, we defined the project in late-2015, calendar 2015. I said at the time, I never imagined in 2015 that we'd be talking treasury management as a great big opportunity. But what we were hearing, particularly from our mid-tier banking customers, and now this interest has grown, was that most of the treasury management solutions out there had gotten pretty stale. And it felt like there was a big need, a demand for a new \u2013 a fresh, new solution taking advantage of newer technology. So that's why we went down this path in the first place. And the farther we've gone down, the more that's been validated in talking to customers. So, not every bank or credit union that's going to be signed for a Treasury Management solution. Those are big solutions, you have to have larger commercial customers to do it. But we think, among our larger banks in particular, and now among our larger credit unions, there is a demand out there. And we think we have a good opportunity. And I'll remind you that this isn't restricted to our core base. We developed this as a ProfitStars solution that we can sell to any core customers, not dependent on a Jack Henry core solution. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: And the nice thing was, we had the talent in-house to develop this. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. The leadership in-house. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: That's great. Thanks for your help. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Hey, good morning, Dave and Kevin. Dave, I wanted to get your thoughts on just kind of the spending environment for banks and credit unions so far. And if there's a change in terms of, maybe if banks are spending more, or credit unions are spending more? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I think the environment right now, the demand environment is strong. So, we just posted 119% of quota for Q3. That's not an easy number for the sales team to hit. So, demand is strong, spending is solid. There's a lot of concern out there among our customers, waiting to see what truly comes out of the new administration that's going to impact them, but generally, there seems to be optimism. The spending environment is generally pretty good. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well, and the other thing I'd say, Kartik, is it amaze me, the number of core system evaluations that continue to go on, like the press release we recently put out that Dave referred to, the six $1 billion-plus sized credit unions we signed. We've had very good success on the banking side. And there's just a lot of activity out there going on, looking at core system evaluations, which we are winning our fair share of those. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : So, Dave and Kevin, when you said that demand is strong, were you referring to core systems, or were you referring to other ancillary products where you're seeing decent amount of demand, or maybe both? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: All of the above, yeah. On the core side, we have a lot of core evaluations \u2013 we're engaged in a lot of core evaluations right now. As I said, we signed 13 in the quarter, which is a very good number. So, lots of activity on the core side, but also on the add-on complementary products, both in the ProfitStars group, meaning outside the Jack Henry base, and inside the Jack Henry base. So, just all the way across the board, things are solid right now. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Just to make sure, that 13 we signed in the third quarter did not clean-up the pipeline. Fourth quarter started out very strong as well. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : And, Kevin, I apologize for asking you to repeat this. I just didn't write it down quick enough. You said, as term fees were concerned, fourth quarter this year versus fourth quarter last year, could you just repeat that for me? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Last year, fourth quarter, we had right at $15 million in deconversion fees. And we \u2013 based on what we see today, we anticipate that's going to be down about $8.5 million. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : And so, for the year, how much would you have had this year compared to last year, and do you think \u2013 what would you think is a normal level? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well, that's a good question, Kartik. I'm not sure in today's environment what normal would be. But last year, we \u2013 total deconversion fees for the year, for the entire year, was about $38 million, and we're probably going to end up this year somewhere around $37 million or $38 million. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : So, about the same? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: About the same. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : All right. Thank you very much. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Morning. (17:04) Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: I guess, the first one, Dave, can we just go back to the conversation on the core deals, the signings in the quarter, the 13. Is there any way to sort of frame that in a couple of levels? The average size of the deals or the banks that are doing the core deals and was a normal quarter for a number of core deals? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: A normal quarter, maybe 10, somewhere around 10. I don't have the metrics on exactly the sizes of everybody that signed. But on the credit union side, as we pointed out, we've signed larger deals, over $1 billion have been the trend here this year. And I would say the same is true on the banking side. I \u2013 we've been signing larger banks on the banking side as well. Really, really good success there, so I don't have the exact breakdown, but I would say the trend is to larger banks. We still sign mid-size that's, but the trend has been larger banks and definitely to larger credit unions. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah. That's kind of what I was getting at. And you talked about the quota attainment, that 119%. Was that for the quarter or was that year-to-date? And then more importantly for me is, is there any way to sort of frame what the sales growth was? We obviously don't know what your quotas are. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: So, year-over-year for the comparable quarter last year, is that what you're asking? Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Actually, more year-to-date what your bookings... David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Oh. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: ...would be by the three brands. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Year-to-date, I don't have the breakdown by the brand. But I would say, they're up probably 6% \u2013 7%. Kevin's thinking 7% year-over-year. Year-to-date, year-over-year, the combined sales grew probably up around 7%. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: So, Kevin, all else equal, is that a reasonable proxy to think about fiscal 2018? Obviously, it's early, but should we still be thinking that 6% to 7% kind of revenue growth going into 2018, all else equal, with the Alogent drag? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. That's probably right knowing Glenn. (18:58) I mean, I'm not really ready to give firm guidance because obviously, we just started the budget process, but I don't see any reason why we wouldn't continue growing at that same pace. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: And then, just finally, you talked about and highlighted the big credit union deals on the Symitar side, but just broadly, can you sort of update us on what you're seeing competitively in the CU side? I mean, one of your peers always talks pretty optimistically ; you do as well. But maybe you could sort of frame for us sort of where you are in sort of a net takeaway or loss perspective year-to-date? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Year-to-date, I don't know that I have the net takeaway number year-to-date. I can \u2013 I was going to point this out on Monday, I'll just mention it now. So, in the past five years, just to give you a feel, we have signed well over 100 new credit unions, meaning competitive replacements, well over 100 on the Episys platform. Our major competitor, who you guys always reference, has signed six new \u2013 brand new to them customers. So, I feel really good about where we are as far as competitive takeaways. And I can have the year-to-date numbers when we get together on Monday, but I just don't happen to have those with me. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: And I can count on one hand the number we've lost. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: On the fingers. (20:22) Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks. In my first question, I guess, the term fees have been elevated, but core revenue growth really hasn't changed at all. So, is there some level of revenue headwind it would seem from having such a high level of term fees, but is it just that the sales activity has been stronger than normal to basically offset those losses, and then you get back to that pretty normalized 7% revenue growth? Is that kind of the formula? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, that's pretty much it, Dave. I mean, sales continue to be strong, and we continue to install (21:12) products and services. The deconversion fees, we have no control over those. I mean, that's typically when a bank or a credit union gets acquired or \u2013 depends on economy. (21:24) We have no control over the timing of that. I mean, the revenue gets recognized based on when they actually deconvert, and we get the check from them is when we have to recognize it. So, it's almost a cash basis recognition. So, it is what it is. But we do have some visibility going into the quarter. This quarter was a little higher than what we anticipated, which is why we beat consensus estimate by $0.05. But going in next quarter, we don't think that's going to be the case. We think it's going to be down significantly. And, based on some of the activity we're seeing, we think that deconversion fees could actually be down in FY 2018 at this point. But again, a lot of that depends on M&A activity, depends on the economy. It's just something that's kind of out of our control, and the best we can do is guess at it and try to guide you all the best we can. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Got you. And I guess the other thing, most of you and your competitors have been talking about how the new \u2013 the better banking environment, or the perceived better banking environment, it's not helping so much this year, because the banks have to kind of react and think first before they make decisions on spending more. But do you think that's actually showing up in sales (22:44) it seems like you and all your competitors had pretty good sales quarters, and it just takes a little while for the sales pipeline to kind of hit the revenue. So, do you think you're seeing the early evidence of it hitting sales already? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well, as I said earlier, the demand environment today is strong. So, there is optimism among our customers, both on the banking side and the credit union side. And so, I think, if I understood your question, I think the answer to your question is yes. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah, okay. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I'll say this, Dave. We had pretty strong sales here the entire year. So, I don't know that we've seen any huge surge in demand in this quarter compared to Q2 or Q1. I think it continues to be strong. I think the optimism for the bankers, based on what they're hearing coming out of the government, and they're trying to ease on regulation, that sort of thing, I think that's all increasing their positive attitudes and optimism. But I don't think we've seen any huge surge, it's just things continue to be solid. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: To Kevin's point, you may recall, on the Q1 earnings call, I pointed out that that was a record sales quarter \u2013 record Q1 sales quarter for us. And so, Q1 is normally a good quarter, but it's not normally huge. But as compared to any Q1 we've ever had, that was the best sales quarter, the best Q1 we've ever had. And the comps included Alogent, we didn't net that out of the comps. So, it was really a \u2013 it was a very good start of the year, and as Kevin points out, that's what we've been experiencing so far this fiscal year. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: And that was following a record Q4. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. You guys kind of do well no matter what it seems like every quarter pretty much. So, congrats on that. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Kevin Williams for any further remarks. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Michelle. As Dave mentioned, I'll repeat it again, I would like to remind everyone that our 2017 Analyst/Investor Day is to be held next Monday, May 8, at the Westin Property at the Denver, Colorado Airport. We're doing it there to make it easy for everyone to fly in and out just like last year. As Dave mentioned, there will be updates by both him and myself; Mark Forbis, our CTO; all three of our brand presidents will be there to present. Our general manager of repayments group will be there; and then all of our directors of sales from all three brands. And Steve Tomson, our GM of Sales and Marketing will be there also to give presentations and updates, which will be followed by a mini tech fair with the products that I mentioned earlier. You can still register. It's not too late. You can email me or Vance Sherard, and we'll get you the link to the registration site. So, as a wrap-up, I want to thank you all for joining us today to review our third quarter fiscal 2017 results. We're pleased with the results from our ongoing operations and the efforts of all of our associates to take care of our customers.

David Togut - Evercore ISI Brendan Hardin - Northcoast Research Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. Eric Ciura - Robert W. Baird & Co. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Jack Henry & Associates Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Kevin Williams. Sir, you may begin. Kevin Williams : Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for the Jack & Associates Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer. On the call with me today is David Foss, President and CEO. The agenda for the call this morning is similar to what we've done in the past. In just a few minutes, I'll turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the state of the business, the performance of the quarter. Then I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market close, provide some updated guidance for FY 2018, and then we'll open the line for questions. I need to remind you that remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statements about the future, these are subject to a number of factors, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong, albeit somewhat noisy operating quarter. As in the past, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work that went into producing those results for our fourth fiscal quarter. As we've discussed previously, we divested our Alogent division at the end of last year, so the comparable quarter again includes a headwind for revenue growth. As you've probably seen yesterday's press release include the chart designed to help explain the impact of that deal, deconversions and other items impacting our numbers this quarter. Kevin will review that information during his remarks. Total revenues increased 5% for the quarter and increased 9% excluding the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters and excluding Alogent revenue from the prior year quarter. Organic revenue growth was also 5% for the quarter. Our payments businesses continue to perform well, posting a 4% increase in revenue this quarter and a 6% increase, excluding the impact of deconversion fees. Our outsourcing and cloud revenue growth for the quarter was 3%, and if you exclude the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters, we saw a very solid 10% increase. All of our sales teams had an outstanding fourth quarter, finishing at combined 113% of quota. The core teams closed 15 new core deals including 3 de novo banks and 15 competitive takeaways, which included another $1-billion-plus credit union and a $18 billion bank. We also saw solid success with several of our key strategic solutions like HNS, our Banno digital suite, Treasury Management, and our Enterprise Risk Mitigation Solutions. Later this month, we'll be hosting our annual Symitar Educational Conference in San Diego, which is always a great event. In October, we'll welcome our JHA Banking and ProfitStars' clients to our first combined event in Nashville. These conferences always provide a terrific opportunity for us to hear directly from our clients and understand their strategic priorities. As I mentioned in the press release, our employee engagement and customer satisfaction scores remain very high. When you combine that with the sales-forces performing well, a solid suite of solutions and healthy sales pipeline, I have confidence that we are well positioned for success in the fiscal year 2018. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Dave. Support and services line revenue, which represents 97% of our total revenue for the quarter, continues to drive our revenue growth. A breakdown for our support and services, implementation revenue of $12.9 million or $14.7 million was a decrease of 12% for the quarter. But if you back out the Alogent impact from last year, the decrease is only 4%. Electronic payments was $136.5 million versus $131.5 million, as Dave mentioned, it increased 4%, but 6% net of the deconversion fees. OutLink was $86.2 million versus $84.2 million, again, increased 3% for the quarter, but 10% net of deconversion fees. And in-house maintenance was $84 million versus $81.4 million, which is a nice increase of 3% concerning the impact we have from our in-to-outs for the quarter, but it also increased 7% if you back out the Alogent maintenance from the prior year which we no longer have. Our bundled services went up to $51.3 million versus $41.7 million, which again this is implementation license and maintenance revenue combined for bundled services related to [multi-home] [ph] contracts, which just will go away when the new rev standard 606 comes in effect in FY 2019. Total revenue for the quarter grew 9%, backing out Alogent revenue it was - and the impact for deconversion fees, it grew 9%. There were some benefits as mentioned in the press release in the credit union statement from increased terminations of contracts. However, without that impact our revenue would have still grown a little over 7% for the quarter. Adjusting on deconversion fees from both years, full year revenue is up 7%, but backing out the impact of Alogent from prior year and deconversion fees from both years revenue grew 8%. Gross margins were down slightly to 43% compared to 44% in last year's fourth quarter, which is actually pretty strong considering the significant decrease in deconversion fees in this quarter compared to year ago quarter. Our operating margins were down due to the gain on sale of Alogent in Q4 last year. However, adjusting out the impacts of Alogent last year and the deconversion fees from both years, our operating margins from ongoing operations actually improved from Q4 from adjusted 23.6% last year to 24.6% this year. And for the full year, our operating margins improved slightly, backing out the deconversion fees and the impacts of Alogent from 23.5% last year to 23.6% for full year fiscal 2017 adjusted. The effective tax rate increased from 27.4% last year to 34.4% in this year's fourth quarter, primarily due to the impact from taxes last year from the sale of Alogent. For the full fiscal year, our taxes increased from 31% to 33%, primarily for the same reasons. Adjusting for the deconversion fees and Alogent for both the quarter and fiscal year, our net income was up 8% for both periods. And with these same adjustments, EPS was up 10% for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Included in total amortization, which is disclosed in the press release as part of depreciation and amortization, any amortization of intangibles from acquisitions, which is down to $3.5 million this quarter, compared to $4.2 million last fiscal year's quarter. Free cash flow was approximately 88% of net income. However, this is primarily due to the timing of collections of receivables and payments of AP and accrued expenses, and other working capital type things. If you back out the net change of working capital, our free cash flow would have actually been closer to 98% of our net income. During the year, we deployed our capital by investing $148.2 million back into our company through CapEx and developing products, and returned $221.8 million to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. Our return on equity for the trailing 12 months was 24.2%. Before I provide updated guidance for FY 2018, I wanted to make everyone aware that starting Q1, we are changing our reporting lines of revenue and expenses on the income statement, as I previously mentioned at the Analyst Day in May. Our license and hardware had become so immaterial that we no longer report - we will no longer report those as separate lines. Instead, we will be reporting two lines of revenue, which are services and support, which include all one-time revenues, in-house maintenance for all products, and outsourcing, and cloud service offerings. The other line of revenue will be processing, which will include all of our card, digital, remittance transaction, and mobile type revenues. Then we'll report three lines of costs, we will have cost of revenue, which will be the cost of - direct cost of sales related to the two lines of revenue, I just mentioned. We will continue to have a research and development expense line and the third line will be selling and general, administrative expenses. We were also going to revamp our segments a little bit, and we will no longer be disclosing banking and credit union segments. We are actually going to change that to four segments that is actually more in line with the way, Dave and I run and manage the business. The four segments will be, the first will be payments, which will include all of our various electronic payments offering, such as credit, debit and ATM transaction processing, online bill pay and remote deposit capture. The next reporting segment will be core, which will include all license, hardware, invitation services, and maintenance for in-house offerings and all outsourcing services relating to our banking and credit union core offerings. The next segment will be complimentary-products, which will include all of our in-house and outsourced product offerings and services other than core and payments. And the fourth reporting segment will be corporate and other, which will include all of our corporate overhead accounts and any revenue expenses not directly related to one of the other three separately reported segments. We believe this will provide much more clarity and transparency into our operations, and obviously, we will restate prior year's numbers as we go through the year for each quarter and year-to-date for comparison purposes. So now update on guidance. We projected our revenue from deconversion fees caused by M&A activity will decrease in FY 2018 and cause a headwind of approximately $8 million, with a good part of this coming in the first quarter. So this will continue to cause a little noise, but we will continue to provide the deconversion revenue on a quarterly basis so you can see how our true operations are performing just like we did in the press release we put out yesterday. Also as we disclosed in the press release yesterday, we divested our regulatory reporting group, which represent approximately $3 million in revenue FY 2017, and also we discussed last quarter if there were some revenue headwind and margin pressures from getting our new payments platform in place, and getting our customers converted to that platform over the next couple of years. Therefore, for our full-year FY 2018, we expect our reported GAAP revenue growth to be in the 5% to 6% range. But by backing out the decrease in deconversion fees for both years, we expect revenue to grow more in line in the 6% to 7% growth for FY 2018. Also we expect our effective tax rate increase to 34% in FY 2018 compared to 33% in FY 2017. So for the fiscal year, we expect reported net income to show approximately 4% growth, but by backing out the deconversion fees from both years and the change in taxes would actually more of 6% to 8% growth in net income from true ongoing operations. But reported EPS for the year should grow approximately 5% and be in the $3.26 to $3.30 range, while EPS adjusted to deconversion fees would actually growing more in the 7% to 9% range, without any consideration of future stock buybacks in these estimates. For Q1 FY 2018, we expect deconversion fees for the quarter to be down approximately $5 million compared to last year just for the first quarter. So the first quarter reported revenue should show growth of approximately 5% by netting out deconversion fees to be more in line of 7% to 8% growth. And with the decrease in deconversion fees and the increased tax rate, we expect net income for Q1 to be slightly down to flat compared to last year's previously announced with the EPS in the $0.78 to $0.79 range. Therefore, because of the decreased deconversion fees and the higher tax rate, consensus estimates appear to need to be trimmed $0.03 to $0.04 for Q1 and approximately $0.10 for the entire year. Obviously, there could be changes due to higher than expected deconversion fees, stock buybacks, or changes in the federal corporate tax rates during the year, which if any of these happen, we will obviously provide updates on future earnings calls. With that, that concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions. Operator, will you please open the call line up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Your line is open. Blake Anderson : Good morning, this is Blake on for Brett. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate all the details in the guidance. Could you just give maybe an update as well for clarification on your operating income margin expansion? I knew you talked about maybe 50 to 75 bps at the Analyst Day. Could you maybe say how much that would be for the year and then maybe also ex deconversion fees might - what you expect that would be? Kevin Williams : Are you talking about for FY 2018, Blake? Blake Anderson : Yes. Kevin Williams : Well, as I said, I mean, if we have any expense in FY 2018, it will probably be at the very end of the year, because remember, we've made this very clear on the fourth quarter call and the Analyst Day, that by on-boarding all of our customers and all new customers starting in January of 2018, we'll be going on the new platform for the agreement that we signed at PSCU and FDC. There will be some duplicate costs and some other pressures on our margins, probably for the next two years, until we can get one of the platforms shut down as we get these customers migrated over. So I don't see much expansion, if any, on our margins, in our operating margins for FY 2018. I was pleased with the operating margin expansion that we saw in FY 2017, if you back out all the noise of almost 100 bps for the quarter and a slight increase for the year. But I think if we can just maintain our margins pretty much in line for FY 2018, I'll be pretty happy. Blake Anderson : Okay. And then, you said for the 1Q, you said deconversion fees should be down about $5 million year-over-year. Kevin Williams : That's what it looks like right now, Blake. Blake Anderson : Okay. But you're still not ready to say, maybe for the full year, can you say whether that it will be up or down? Kevin Williams : For the full year, we anticipate it's going to be down $8 million to $9 million. Blake Anderson : Okay, all right. Kevin Williams : Which is why I think we - with that and the increase in taxes, is why I'd say, we'd probably need to trim EPS consensus by about $0.10 for the entire year. And those two factors is what makes that up. Blake Anderson : All right, that's really helpful. Thank you. And then the detail in the credit union revenue was helpful. Should we expect that to maybe continue again going forward or is that more of a one-time event? Kevin Williams : That is kind of a one-time event. We actually expect our bundled revenue to be basically flat for this year, as we continue getting ready for the implementation of ASC 606 next July 1. Blake Anderson : Okay. And then any commentary you can give on free cash flow expectations for the year, and maybe just generally, maybe your CapEx expectations going forward? It seems like, obviously, you've been investing a lot in new products. How should we think about your level of CapEx going forward and cash flow for the year? Kevin Williams : Well, like I said, we pretty much got to the ramped up position where we needed to be for developers in the major areas this last year. Our cap software kind of trended down a little bit this year. I think we're probably going to see that again this year, a slight trend down. True CapEx should be relatively flat to maybe down a little bit in FY 2018. So I think you should see a positive impact in both operating and free cash flow into next year. And again, a lot of this comes down to some of the timing of the working capital things. But hopefully, in FY 2018, our true final free cash flow will be closer to - in line with net income for the year. Blake Anderson : All right, very helpful. Thank you very much. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Blake. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. Your line is open. David Togut : Thanks, good morning. You called out 15 competitive takeaways. Could you provide some insights on the main drivers of the takeaways? Which specific products performed particularly well? David Foss : Well, I would - and David, it's Dave Foss. So I would highlight SilverLake, Core Director and Episys as the primary drivers on the Jack Henry side. So Episys, we continue to have great success in the credit union space. As I mentioned, we won another $1 billion credit union with Episys as well as few other credit unions. And then on the banking side, SilverLake being our lead horse if you will, on the banking side, that's the solution that not only won the $18 billion bank that I highlighted, but won I think two of the de novo banks. One, I think was a Core Director decision, but it would be those three. And as far as who we're taking them away from, it's kind of across the board. There's a fair better churn, right, out there right now as far as people looking at new core decisions. And so it wasn't any particular software solution that we beat, it was kind of across the board. David Togut : Understood. And you called out three de novo wins in the quarter. Could you comment on what you expect in the next year or two, in terms of de novo formations? Are you more optimistic in this environment that we'll see more kind of new bank creation? David Foss : Yeah, it's a good question. The FDIC has been actively encouraging new bank startups. And there is a lot of talk today as compared to a couple of years ago. So I don't have any anticipation that we're going to get back to the glory days of 10, 15 years ago, where de-novos were starting up all over the place. But there's absolutely more activity today than there was a year ago around de novo banks. So I think we're at a good pace today. Whether it's sustainable or not, I don't know. But I know there is some good discussion. And I certainly know that the FDIC is actively encouraging startup banks in the U.S. So we're going to continue to follow that. We think it's an opportunity for us, because most of those folks, who startup a new bank, they're looking to grow the bank relatively quickly. And so they're looking for a full slate of products even though they're startup bank, they oftentimes sign for a full slate of products, because they're expecting to grow quickly, usually focused on commercial services. And so those are a good fit for our solution set. David Togut : Understood. Just a quick final question. Given the deregulatory agenda of this administration, are you getting any early read on 2018 bank IT budgets? And to the extent you are - are you seeing any shift between, let's say, more of a cost-cutting and efficiency orientation versus more of a pro-growth agenda? David Foss : So first off is there a - is there interest in a level of deregulation? Absolutely, our banks are very aware of that topic out there. And now, of course, they haven't seen anything meaningful so far, and so they're all kind of still waiting. But the spending environment is strong right now. I think that when you have conversations with the CEOs and Presidents of the banks out there, they're generally optimistic about what the future holds. Don't know yet what the - what regulatory change is going to happen, if any, but they're optimistic. And there's absolutely a shift toward looking at more tools that will help with efficiency within the bank. The efficiency ratio is a key metric for every bank, and this isn't - I'm talking banks not as much on the credit union side, we are on the banking side, definitely a key metric. And so those tools that can help in that regard are definitely top of mind. So one for us, for example, is our enterprise workflow solution, we've talked about it a lot. I think the timing was perfect, when we rolled that out, because a lot of bankers were starting to look at efficiency tools. And we happen to have a state-of-the-art solution new about 1.5 years ago, when that was really becoming top of mind for a lot of banks. Kevin Williams : I will say that one indicator that we always kind of look to is attendance at our national education conferences. And as Dave mentioned in his opening comment, our credit union is later this month and banking is in October. And we already have record attendance signed up for our Symitar Educational Conference. And I think if I'm right, record attendance of prospects are also signed up to be there. David Foss : And for the banking conference, that's in October, so we still have a few months yet of registration, but for the CEO forum, we do a separate CEO track. We have more CEOs signed up now than we've ever had. So a lot of interest among CEOs and a lot of it is driven by the topic you brought up, David. David Togut : Understood. Thank you very much. David Foss : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brendan Hardin with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Brendan Hardin : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So you highlighted a fair bit of churn in core category. Is there anything that's accelerating this as of late? David Foss : I don't know, if there's - other than the fact that a lot of bankers and credit unions were kind of holding on to technology that they felt like needed to be refreshed, and today in the economic environment that they're in, they're a little more positive. I can't point at anything much more significant than that. I will say that on the digital front, the tools that banks and credit unions use to serve their consumers, I think consumer demand is driving a lot of that interest. They really recognize that they have to be positioned with state-of-the-art tools to put in the hands of their consumers mobile banking and tools beyond just traditional mobile banking. So that, I think, helps drive some demand on the digital side. But as far as the traditional core business, I think, it's a lot of people sitting on technology for a while, whether it was, because they were waiting to decide if they were going to sell their bank or if they were waiting to see what happened after the election or there are a lot of things that could have been promoting that. But in this environment today, there is a good bit of review going on among banks and credit unions around technology. Brendan Hardin : Okay, great. And then, any commentary you can give on the progress of the conversion, the debit portfolio, the First Data's platform would be helpful? David Foss : Sure. As Kevin mentioned in his comments a few minutes ago that we'll really start that in calendar year 2018. So we've been - obviously, the messages out there, we've been messaging with our customers and had great response from our customers. They're enthusiastic about the plan and the story. So we've been working on the integration work that needed to be done. So we'll start transitioning a few customers at the end of this calendar year. And then once we get to the beginning of calendar year 2018, that's when we will really start to do those migrations. But as Kevin also highlighted, new customers that we signed at the end of this year, they will go on the new - the combined platform starting in January next year as well. Brendan Hardin : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. David Foss : Yeah, sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Glenn Greene : Thanks. Good morning. So Dave, just to go back to the sort of spending environment and you sort of highlighted above quota attainment in terms of the sales growth. But I was wondering if you could sort of highlight what the aggregate sales growth was and maybe across your key brands. David Foss : The three brands, you mean, so ProfitStars, Banking and Symitar? Glenn Greene : Yes, exactly. David Foss : So we were 113% of quota. So you're looking for me to compare how they did as compared to last year same quarter. Glenn Greene : Year-over-year growth for the year, really sort of full year aggregate bookings. David Foss : And sales quota\u2026 Kevin Williams : Ask another question, I'll get it. David Foss : Okay. Kevin is going to look that up. Do you have something else, Glenn, that I can talk about while he's looking? Glenn Greene : Yes. I guess, I was confused and I was sort of jumping around on different things. But you'd sort of alluded to sort of an investment phase for a couple of years. And I don't know if you were talking about a partnership. And I just want to get clarity on what that meant, and if - what the timeline is of that and sort of the order magnitude of - if there's any incremental expense that we should be thinking about. Is that kind of baked in to the flattish margin that Kevin may have alluded to for fiscal 2018? I just wanted to go back to that. David Foss : You're talking about the First Data-PSCU partnership? Glenn Greene : Yes. David Foss : Yes. So what will happen - so essentially, the kind of the basis for this partnership is First Data will be the processing engine behind everything that we do, we'll be processing on their Omaha [ph] platform. And then PSCU provides the tools on the front end that we will use to support our customers. They've been a long time First Data partner. They've had integration with First Data for something like 25 years. So they provide the front-end tools. And then we do all of the install, support, sales, everything that needs to happen with our customers is a Jack Henry delivered solution. So we're running the PSCU technology and on top of the First Data platform. While PSCU had that technology in place for quite some time, but in order to do the integration to the Jack Henry core solutions and to customize the front end, what we referred to as the bubble wrap in order to customize that to be what we want it to be, it takes a little bit of development time. But then the big impact when it comes to the flatness of margins that Kevin was talking about is, as we go through this conversion, you don't just convert all these banks and credit unions all on the same day, so it's going to take some time to convert them. And as we go through that, we'll continue to maintain our existing platforms, which we run ourselves in-house. But we'll also be taking on this expensive processing on the First Data platform, until we can shut off the platforms that we have in house. So I think that's what he was alluding to in his comments. Glenn Greene : So, I guess, that's where I was going. What's the timeline to complete the conversion? Does this drag for a short period of time into 2019 and then you get a lift on margins in 2020? I'm just sort of trying to understand directionally how we should think about the profitability impact. David Foss : That's exactly, yeah. So you'll see a lift in margin in 2019, 2020 we're done. And then we'll be off the old platforms. They'll be shut down. We'll be running in the new environment completely. Glenn Greene : Okay. And then just a clarification for Kevin, on the credit union item and related to the bundled services\u2026 Kevin Williams : Yeah. Glenn Greene : \u2026so, I didn't do the math, yet. But is that order of magnitude, something like $6 million revenue benefit in the quarter that was sort of one-time? Kevin Williams : Roughly $7 million. Glenn Greene : $7 million. And is that fair to assume that the profitability of that is, I don't know, like a 100% incremental margin or what's the margin profile in that? Kevin Williams : It's high margin, Glenn, but it's not a 100%, because there is also some selling costs and other costs that are related that were sitting in prepaid costs that get rolled out to. So the margins are probably somewhere around 50% in that revenue. Glenn Greene : Okay. And then just a follow-up on my first question, I don't know if you had the time to sort of find the bookings growth by the specific brands. Kevin Williams : Yeah, let me just clarify. When we talk about sales quota, what we measure is actual margin, so it's not really contract value or revenue. It is margin, so like on the service bureau that our sales people get, and on payments they get a discounted rate, a margin calculation based on the terms of the contract. So our actual sales, compared to quota, growth over year was just right at 8% excluding Alogent from last year. Glenn Greene : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Kevin Williams : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Eric Ciura with \u200eRobert W. Baird. Your line is open. Eric Ciura : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess, first in the quarter, revenue beat your expectations by about 3%, but EPS was in line with your expectations, so maybe just talk a little bit about why the revenue beat, which probably came from the bundled services, didn't translate to an EPS beat as well? Kevin Williams : Well, the EPS was down, Eric, because the deconversion fees were obviously lower than what we anticipated are going to be for the fourth quarter. And unlike bundled revenue deconversion fees is literally 100% that drops to the bottom-line. So that was the impact on reported margins and reported EPS. Eric Ciura : Okay. Kevin Williams : Which, again, deconversion fees, we have no control over. That's just when one of our gets acquired, when they actually sign the paperwork, actually deconvert and we get check in hand, so that is when we are required to recognize the revenue. We can't recognize before then. So when it happens it happens, which is why I always try to report what those numbers were so you can back them out and you can actually see what true operations, ongoing operations are for the company. Eric Ciura : Okay. So term fees this quarter were lower than what you had originally expected? Kevin Williams : Yes. Eric Ciura : Okay. And then, you mentioned starting in fiscal 2019, how you no longer have the bundled revenue, can we just talk a little bit more about what impacts that accounting change has in you guys? Kevin Williams : Well, and this is starting January 1 of - or July 1 of 2018. What ASC 606 and it's not - it's not a real clear change in accounting. But I can tell you that we're going to go back sort of the way we used to report revenue. The only thing that we'll kind of be tied together is license and implementation. Maintenance will no longer be tied to that, because the requirement for vendor-specific objective evidence, VSOE, goes out the door. So we can literally go back to basically report it the way we used to, which means as far as the license, and implementations, and things, we'll actually be able to recognize pieces and parts of that quicker than we - under the current structure with the bundling, because obviously under bundling you can't report any revenue until you deliver the last piece of a contract. Going forward, under 606, all those pieces get broken apart and you can recognize these separate pieces as long as you can come up with a best-estimated sales price on each one of those pieces. And I'm not going to get into what impact it has on long-term outsourcing of the contracts, because that's really bizarre, the way we have to treat some of that. We'll talk about that some other time. Eric Ciura : Sure, thanks, guys. Kevin Williams : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Williams for closing remarks. Kevin Williams : Thank you. We're pleased with the results of our ongoing operations and the efforts of all our associates to take care of our customers. Our executives, managers and all of our associates continue to focus on what is best for customers and you, our shareholders. I want to thank again for joining us today. And, operator, will you please provide the replay number for the call? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Charles J. Nabhan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC Operator : Good day ladies and gentlemen welcome to the Jack Henry and Associates First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode and later we will conduct a question and answer session with instructions given at that time. And as a reminder this conference is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the conference over to your host, Kevin Williams, CFO. Please begin. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Tyrone. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry Associates first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer and on the call with me today is David Foss, our President and CEO. The agenda for the call this morning, in just a few minutes I will turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the state of the business and performance for the quarter. Then I'll provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release that we put out yesterday after the market close. Then we'll then open the lines up for Q&A. I need to remind you the remarks and responses to questions concerning future expectations events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future these are subject to a number of factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties. And the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For some of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release in the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. With that I now turn the call over to Dave. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter with record revenue and earnings. As in the past I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work that went into producing those results for the first quarter of our new fiscal year. As we outlined on our last call, this is the first quarter that we have used the new segments to disclose our financials. We believe this new format will provide better transparency for our shareholders and give you better insight into how we manage the business. Kevin will review the new segments in greater detail during his remarks. Total revenue increased 4% for the quarter and increased 6% excluding the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters. Organic revenue growth was also 4% for the quarter. We had a very solid quarter on the core side of our business. Revenue increased by 10% for the quarter and increased by 12% if you exclude the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters. Our payments businesses also continue to perform well posting a 1% increase in revenue this quarter and a 4% increase excluding the impact of deconversion fees. Our combined sales teams had a very solid first quarter finishing well ahead of quota. As I mentioned in the press release, this is particularly noteworthy because of the extremely strong sales quarter we reported for June. The core teams closed 12 new core deals, all of which were competitive takeaways and split evenly between banks and credit unions. We also saw solid success with several of our key strategic solutions like HNS, Treasury Management, and our Enterprise Risk Mitigation Solution. Speaking of those new solutions, we took our first customers live on our new Treasury Management Solution and our new Enterprise Risk Mitigation Solution during the quarter. Additionally, just last month, we took our first customer live with our new First Data PSCU debit card offering. We will implement several other beta clients in the coming months and plan to start large scale card conversions in Q2 next calendar year. At the end of August, we announced the acquisition of Vanguard Software Group and their LoanVantage platform. We have rolled this group into our lending solutions business to provide the missing component we needed to deliver a complete end-to-end online commercial lending solution. Customer reaction to this small acquisition has been very positive because of the strategic nature of the solution. In September, we hosted our annual Symitar Educational Conference in San Diego and saw record attendance during that event. In October, we conducted our first combined Jack Henry Banking and ProfitStars Conference. We hosted more than 3,000 people at that event and received a great response as we showcased several of our new solutions. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Dave. As Dave mentioned, the press release reflects the new reporting lines of revenue and reportable segments that we discussed on the previous earnings calls and actually as far back as last year's Analyst Day. The Services and Support line of revenue which includes license, hardware, invitation services, in-house maintenance, bundled services and outsourcing increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter, or 6% if you exclude the deconversion fees for both quarters. The deconversion fees in this line were down $5.8 million compared to a year-ago quarter which just created a little over a $0.05 EPS headwind, and all deconversion fees are in this line of revenue. The processing line of revenue which includes our online bill pay, card processing, remittance or remote deposit capture along with transaction and digital fees was up 6% compared to the prior year. Total revenue was up 4%, as Dave mentioned, or 6% by excluding these deconversion fees. Our reported consolidated operating margins were down slightly from 26.5% last year to 25.6% this year due to the decreased deconversion fees. But looking at true operations by excluding these deconversion fees for both quarters, our total operating margins improved from 23.6% to 24.1% or a 50 bps improvement. So the deconversion, decreasing deconversion fees has presented a challenge in margin for the quarter, but long term is best for JHA as we would much rather keep our customers. For our new segments, true operating margin improved overall. And just to highlight a little bit about what these segments are, for our core group which those of you that have been through our Analyst Day, you've met our Group President of JHA Banking Symitar. Their business lines are primarily in this core, and the margins in core as reported went up slightly from 54.9% to 56.4%; without the impact of deconversion fees they improve very nicely from 52.6% to 54.8%. Our payments business which is primary to all of our electronic payments groups, that reports up to that group GM, those margins actually declined slightly as reported from 54.2% to 53.5%, but excluding deconversion fees, those also went up from 51.8% to 52.7%. And then our complementary segment which is primarily the ProfitStars brand and then the GM that is over all of our retail and commercial solutions, their margins actually went down a little bit due to deconversion fees from 57.3%to 56.8%, and remained relatively level by excluding those deconversion fees. Also as reported in the release yesterday, we divested our jhaDirect business line during the quarter, which is essentially our forms and supplies business, and we reported a small pre-tax gain of $1.7 million on the sale. However, this also caused a bit of a revenue headwind during the quarter of just under $1 million which without that headwind we would have right in line with consensus estimate of revenue for the quarter. Also excluding the gain, our EPS for the quarter was roughly $0.80 or slightly ahead of consensus estimate. The effective tax rate decreased slightly from 31.9% last year to 31.2% in this year's first quarter, primarily due to the impact on taxes from vesting equity grants which causes Q1 to typically be the lowest effective tax rate quarter of the year. And this is the effective tax rate that we utilize in our guidance for the quarter. We do expect future quarters to return to the total year guided tax rate of approximately 34% for the full fiscal year. Net income was up 2% as reported but was actually a 9% increase without the impact of the decreased deconversion fees. So our ongoing operations continues to be very solid. Included in total amortization, which was disclosed in the press release in the cash flow review is the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions which was down to $3.5 million this quarter compared to $3.7 million last year. Free cash flow was very strong this quarter of $108.9 million or approximately 172% of net income for the quarter which compares to $101.5 million or 162% of net income in Q1 of last year. However remember that our first and fourth fiscal quarters are our largest cash flow quarters due to collections of our annual maintenance fees. During the quarter, we deployed our capital by investing $30.1 million into our company through CapEx and developing products, which is down from $32.7 million or 8% a year ago. We also returned $53.9 million to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends, and our return on equity for the trailing 12 months was 24%. We're currently debt free with nothing drawn on our revolver facility and a very strong cash position which provides significant flexibility. We projected that our revenues from deconversion fees caused by M&A activity would decrease in FY 2018 and cause a headwind of approximately $8 million with a good part of this in the first quarter, which per our guidance we had $5.8 million of this in the first quarter as we guided. So, this will continue to cause some noise but we will continue to provide the deconversion revenue on a quarterly basis so you can see how our true operations are performing. Also, as we disclosed in the press release yesterday, we did divest the jhaDirect business which will represent a little over $6 million in revenue headwind, but we don't believe this to be a huge hurdle to grow over. Also as we discussed last quarter, there will be some revenue headwind and margin pressure from getting our new payments platform in place and getting our customers converted to that platform over the next couple of years. Therefore, for the full year fiscal 2018, we continue to expect our reported GAAP revenue growth to be in the 5% to 6% range. And by backing out the deconversion fees from both years, we think we'll end up the year at the 6% to 7%. We also expect our effective tax rate to increase to 34%, so our net income will be slightly lower than our revenue growth. Our reported EPS for the year should grow approximately 5% to 6%, while EPS adjusted for the deconversion fee should actually be growing the 7% to 9% without any consideration of future stock buybacks. For Q2, we expect deconversion fees to be essentially flat with last year. So our revenues should grow approximately 6% to 7% in Q2 and operating income should be fairly in line with that revenue growth but with the increased tax rate we expect net income Q2 to be in the 4% to 6% range compared to last year. So at this time, we are comfortable with the consensus estimate of $0.80 EPS for Q2. Obviously, there can be changes due to higher than expected deconversion fees, stock buybacks or changes in the federal corporate tax rates which could affect these, but we will provide updates in future earnings calls. With that, this concludes our opening comments. We're now ready to take questions. Tyrone, will you please open the call lines up for questions. Operator : Sure. First question is from Brett Huff of Stephens. Your line is open. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, Brett. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: First of all, thanks for the detail on the divestiture on the $1 million. I think you said when you went through that math, it was just under $1 million. And so, I think that would have brought you, I think you said right in line with what the Street is expecting. Was that the right math that I heard? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yes. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yes, but adding that back will put us right at the $361 million. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of divestitures, you guys have done a few of those kind of around the edges. Are there more of those that we should expect as you guys kind of refocus your capital maybe on higher growth areas and things like that, or how should we think about that? I know you don't need to generate any cash in order to do M&A deals if something interesting comes along. But kind of what's your outlook on some of those divestitures? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Good question. The, what we've been doing here with these divestitures really lines up with the message that I delivered at the Analyst Day here earlier this year around focus. So, we had a few of those very small businesses that were frankly not focused or not in the areas that we believe we really need to remain focused. Forms and Supplies is one of those. It's not a growth area and it's not something that we're particularly focused on. So, I can tell you that we don't have any other anticipated divestitures right now. I think we've gotten rid of kind of the solutions that were around the edges and now the mission is to grow the business as it is. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. And then last question for me. Kevin, I think you mentioned again some of the work you were doing around getting the First Data, PSCU, things off the ground or maybe it was Dave. So, the first debit customer already went live. How did that go and does that feel like you got, give you guys good line of sight for the timelines I think you had outlined for us starting really to convert a lot of those folks this year, but then kind of finishing them up next year? Does that timeline still make sense given that first one that went live? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. We feel really good about the \u2013 our positioning right now. I think the team from all three sides \u2013 remember, there are three partners in this deal between First Data, Jack Henry and PSCU. All three of us were surprised at how smoothly that conversion went, four, five issues I guess identified for them resolved within no time. One that was something that took a little bit longer to resolve, but definitely a very smooth conversion for the customer. Customer is thrilled. We have our second beta customer in line right now and then we'll do two more in January and once we get through those four beta customers then we'll start to get conversions lined up after that. But so far it's gone very smoothly. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. And remember, Brett, the timing of this is actually and if you remember when we talked about this at the Analyst Day you know this is a two and a half year process to get all these customers migrated over. So, as Dave said we should be through betas by the end of January. Starting sometime in mid to late February, we will start the mass movement of our customers. We're planning to move somewhere between 60 to 80 at a time. But right at 1,000 customers, it's just going to take a while to do that because you can't do them all the same time. So, it's really going to be once we get started, it's going to be about an 18 month, maybe a little longer project, to get all of our existing customers migrated. And starting in April, we will start putting new customers on this new platform and our first card customers, credit card customers. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Great. That's what I needed. Thanks for the detail, guys. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question is from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Hey, Kevin, if I could just get your view on this PSCU partnership; you talked about the conversion and time line. Can you just talk about the cost and savings associated with eventually converting those customers over to the PSCU, First Data platform and how it impacts Jack Henry? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well, the, like we said from the very beginning, this is going to put a little headwind especially on our margins because as we start migrating these customers over obviously we will have the transaction fees that we'll be paying PSCU and then they will pay whatever their agreement is with FDC for the actual process and transactions. But at the same time, we still have two main mainframes with backup mainframes for the two existing systems that we have to continue to support and enhance. We still have all of our developers continuing to enhance the code for our existing customers, which we have to keep those in place, continue to take care of our customers, continue to protect our customers until we get all those migrated off. Now, once we get them migrated off, then obviously there will be a big reduction in cost because we won't need for maintenance and support and maintenance that goes along with them and the facility costs, and everything else. So, there's going to be some margin pressure but by the time we get the last customer over, our margins will effectively be higher than they are today. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : I know you talked about organic growth in the second quarter and kind of based on the backlog that Dave talked about, how would you anticipate organic growth trending through the year? Do you think you'll be similar in the second half of the year or do you think there's any changes based on maybe installation backlog or how you see some customers coming off? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: No. I think our organic growth is pretty solid for the year. I think it's going to stay right in line with what we talked about for the second quarter, Kartik. The card business represents about 20% of our revenue and the biggest growth drivers we have right now, was in this quarter was our core business without, even with, considering without the deconversion fees, and that continues to do extremely well. As Dave said, we signed 12 new core customer takeaways in Q1. I think and, Dave, correct me if I'm wrong here, but I think our sales pipeline is as big as it's ever been in the history of the company. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: That's correct. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: With the last years that we have. So, I'm feeling pretty, pretty good about the rest of the year, Kartik. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : And then, Kevin, just one last question. Obviously, the balance sheet's in great shape. And I was just wondering, from an acquisition standpoint, have you seen anything in the marketplace that piques your interest or do you think it's more about right now return capital to shareholders? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well, I mean, we would love to find the right acquisition. We continue to kick the tires, Kartik. I mean, we hope that the right one will come along shortly because we would love to deploy our capital that way. But obviously, it's been a while since we've found a sizable one and the Vanguard, as Dave mentioned, fit in very nicely and it just kind of with the Bayside acquisition that we did before that, the Banno acquisition was small but very extremely strategic for us going forward. So, we'll continue to look at those and we'll continue to look for sizable ones that could move the needle. But at the same time we will continue to effectively return capital to our stockholders by continuing the quarterly dividend and increasing it and we'll continue to evaluate stock buybacks. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Thank you very much. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, Kartik. Operator : Our next question is from Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is open. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks. So, I guess I wanted to just review three topics that all three, the big core processes. All of you have talked about, or most of you have talked about, term fees being down, lending being strong, and I think both you and Fiserv made acquisitions there and EMV being down. I think that doesn't really matter as much for you guys. But, why are term fees down and why is lending such a strong place right now that you guys are making acquisitions in. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I think, let me address the last part first, as far as lending is concerned, and this is Dave, David. So, what we've identified with our customers is a real need. On the banking side in particular but also on the credit union side now, there's a real desire and need to grow in the commercial space. So, you saw us roll out the treasury management solution. That was 100% geared toward helping our banking customers serve their commercial customers. Same thing is true on the lending side. The focus that we've had is on commercial lending. So, this Vanguard acquisition, although it is definitely not a needle mover as far as revenue is concerned, is very strategic because it filled the last remaining hole that we had to produce an end-to-end online commercial lending solution that allows our banks to compete with the OnDecks and the Kabbages and all those folks that are out there trying to grab commercial borrowers away from our bank. So, to enable the banks to compete and grow, many of them are putting a lot of focus on the commercial space. We, in turn, have put a lot of focus on providing the tools to help them grow in the commercial space both on the treasury management side and on the lending, the borrowing side, to make them more competitive. As far as term fees, term fees tend to go up and down. There is a lot of merger activity still in the space. Mergers and acquisitions are what tend to drive termination fees. But just looking at our customer base and the things that we know are in the pipeline, that's the projection as far as what we see. We just have fewer of our customers that are being acquired away. And we've had a big focus on the win-a-merger concept which we've talked about before. Win-a-merger being somebody running a competitive core comes in and acquires one of our core customers, and we end up turning the acquirer into a Jack Henry core customer. We actually had two win-a-mergers in the quarter. Well, that would have been a term fee, but we turned it into a win for Jack Henry because we gain a new customer out of it when we gain the acquiring bank as a new customer. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: And, Dave, as Dave just mentioned, it really depends on the term fees. Part of that, I mean the M&A activity continues to go on. But it really depends on what type of institution or which delivery method they have, impacts termination fees quite a bit. So, we could have a quarter where we lose three in-house customers and we get zero termination fees, where in the next quarter, we lose three outsource customers through mergers and we get several million dollars in early term fees. So, there's just so many moving parts, which is why I've decided just on a quarterly basis just to back out the deconversion fees so you can actually see what our operations are doing. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. No that makes sense. And part of the reason just seems like everybody is having lower term fees right now. It just kind of feels like maybe M&A activity maybe continues but maybe kind of peaked around mid-year last year, and I mean that probably is good for everybody if it's actually going down a little bit. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well, I'll tell you, we just added another conversion team specifically to focus on M&A. We have a lot of our customers acquiring other customers. So, we added another team on the banking side. So, it may have peaked last year, but I wouldn't say it's slowing down. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Okay. Good. And then you said JHA about a $6 million revenue headwind to fiscal 2018. Is Vanguard, I know you said it's pretty immaterial, but is it about that same size? Like do those two roughly offset each other? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: No. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: It's way smaller. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yes. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Now we think over time by having that piece to complete our end-to-end commercial lending solution, that that's going to help our entire lending piece grow. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. That acquisition was truly a strategic acquisition to fill that. So, what Vanguard brought to us was an auto decisioning component that allows \u2013 so think about a commercial borrower going online at the bank site. They fill in this information, provide the information through the online portal, and now decisioning happens in an automated fashion. You can get a quick decision back saying you've been approved by your bank for a commercial loan. Very powerful. So it was, it's very small revenue but very strategic for us to fill out the complete story for our clients. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. And just one final one. Are you guys going to put like an 8-K out or something on the historicals using the new segmentation at all? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: It will be in the 10-Q, right? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: It will be on the 10-Q. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. With some historical data too just so we can see like maybe eight quarters back or four quarters back or something? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well, it will be restated, but it will not be eight quarters, Dave. I'll have to think about that. We have not contemplated doing that, but let me talk to my staff, and we'll see what we can do. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right. No pressure. No big deal. But thanks for all the help, guys. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Dave. Operator : Our next question is from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Charles J. Nabhan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. This is Charles Nabhan calling in for Tim. Just had a quick follow-up on the PSCU partnership. You alluded to expense runway of about 18 months. And just wanted to get a sense for how to think about that from, if I heard you correctly, wanted to get a sense for when to think about \u2013 when we could anticipate the headwind to margins turning into a tailwind? You talked about expenses dropping off and just want to get a better understanding of the timing of that. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I would tell you right now because we are still in the planning process, to get the conversions all lined out, and at this point we don't really know exactly how many we will able to convert at a time. So, it's kind of a rough estimate. But what we think that by two years from this December, so December 2020, we should have all of our customers migrated, be able to cut all the costs out and starting in Q3 of that year, fiscal Q3 our margins should go up nicely. Charles J. Nabhan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. And as a follow-up, could you talk about the pipeline and what customer demand looks like for the new treasury and cash management products? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Sure. So, again we just completed our annual client conference. So, we had a great opportunity to not only showcase the solution but to have customers who are up and running live now talk about the solution. So, we have four customers that are live with treasury management. One of them actually spoke, the CIO for the bank spoke, at the conference and shared with our customers the impact that they were having. So, pipeline looks strong. Now the thing I've mentioned on previous calls and I'll just say it again treasury management is a solution designed for larger institutions who are serving very large commercial customers. So, this isn't something that you're going to sell to 1000 or 2000 banks. This is something that will be sold only to the largest banks in our family. But given that, demand is strong and we're very happy with where that position \u2013 that product is positioned today. Charles J. Nabhan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thank you for the color. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Sure Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. I think the other part of that, the cash management solution, that is for all of the smaller banks that don't go for that. And that is going extremely well too. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. We distinguish between treasury management and cash management. So, treasury management is the new solution that we've talked about a lot. We just put the press release out, all that kind of stuff. That's for the largest banks, the largest clients. As Kevin points out, cash management is the lower end solution. We revamped that. We've had that for several years, revamped that and have assigned a number of new customers on that solution. It's a smaller solution, not as big a ticket price, but that has received a very solid reception from our customers as well. Charles J. Nabhan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. I apologize if some of this has been talked about because I jumped on the call a little bit late. But maybe, Dave, could you talk about the sales activity across the three brands, thinking Banking, Symitar, ProfitStars? It sounded like in aggregate you were above quota. But could you maybe parse across the three big brands? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I can tell you \u2013 I don't know that I can quote where every one of them finished for the quarter, but I can tell you all three of the brands finished ahead of quarter \u2013 ahead of quota for the quarter. So, sales in both banking, specifically around core and credit union, our on core, we're strong in the quarter. The ProfitStars group, of course, having a much wider variety of solutions. The Payments groups, I think, did particularly well in the quarter for the ProfitStars groups. But the other groups including our Gladiator team which sells our H&S solution, and the other teams all had a solid quarter. So, all I can say in specific is, every one of them finished ahead of quota for the quarter. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. And I also add that all of our sales folks are extremely excited about all the new products we have. And I think they feel like they have about as many new toys to sell as they've ever had in the history of the company. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, Kevin, so I don't think any of us have rejiggered our models on the new segment thing. But given that, is there any way to give us some color on the old sort of support and services, the piece parts or sort of thinking that EFT, the outlook and house maintenance, the relative growth rates there at least directionally? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: The old models, boy, Glenn, I don't even have that with me. That... Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: So the outsourcing business directionally how much \u2013 how did outsourcing do. How did payments do? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well I mean payments is really pretty much still payments Glenn. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I mean the payment segment is still pretty much what it was. Outsourcing which is in core, outsourcing continued to grow very well. I think it was like at 12% for the quarter compared to a year ago, actually a little higher than that with deconversion fees. So, both of those lines of business continue to do extremely well. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: And obviously that's 60-plus percent of our total revenue. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. And then just based on your sort of high level guidance comments. I think you talked about you know 6% to, what was it, 5% to 6% EPS growth for the year. Can we just assume that you're comfortable where current consensus is right now which kind of seems in that range, 3.28%. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yes. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just one balance sheet question. It looked like deferred revenue declined year-over-year. Is that sort of an accounting anomaly or maybe just a little bit of color on that. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well the current deferred revenue went up. The long-term went down and really that's just the shift in our business, Glenn, that we're moving from in-house customers to outsourcing. We don't have near the long-term maintenance contracts or long-term hardware maintenance out there. So, the long term is going to continue to go down. The fact that the current deferred is strong and up continues to be a very positive in my thinking. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore. Your line is open. Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning. This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Can you talk a little bit about the puts and takes for the payment segment topline growth, maybe just break out bill pay, transactions, debit and credit card processing? And then if you can just talk about your outlook for the remainder of the year and long term for payments specifically. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: So, you're talking about revenue growth, Rayna, you said puts and takes. So, I'm trying to figure out what the take would be. But you're talking about revenue growth in those areas? Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Revenue growth. Correct. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Okay. So for the card business excluding deconversion fees, roughly 3% year-over-year revenue growth. For the bill pay business, roughly 10% year-over-year. And for the other piece of our payments business is what we refer to as enterprise payments which is remote deposit capture, ACH origination, those types of things, it's about 7% year-over-year in that area. Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : And how should we think about payments growth overall topline in the midterm? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: As far as percentage growth? Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Yes. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: So, I think we've talked in the past about 4% to 5% overall being a good sustainable number for us and I think that's still true, unless, Kevin, you want to add anything to that comment. But, I think that's still reasonable. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: No, I think at this point, Rayna, the 4% to 5% is a good guide out there. Obviously, with the new platform coming up, that some of the new opportunities, because we had never sold credit cards before. So, could that go up a little bit once we get the new platform rolled out and get all the products, maybe. But I don't want to be building that in right now. So, let's just go with the 4% to 5% at this point. Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Could you provide us a rough timeline of when you think you can ramp up the credit card processing business? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well, we're starting to sell the credit card already. In fact, we signed our first deal yesterday, literally yesterday, first credit card deal. So our team is already out there selling. We know that there's demand among our customers. That's what prompted us to do this in the first place. The question is, as you talk to individual customers, what contract do they have in place already, what type of timeline for them as far as terminating their current contract to move to something else, is it organic or bluefield or greenfield for them to sign up with us as a new provider. So, I don't know that I'm comfortable projecting at this point how fast that's going to ramp. But we see a good bit of demand, and we have a lot of conversations going now with our sales team and our customers. But as I mentioned, we've only signed one customer so far, so we kind of got to get a little farther into this before we can really discuss how that'll ramp. Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Got it. That's really helpful. And just lastly, could you just discuss any major product investments you're making and revamps? Like, what's next in the pipeline with investments? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I don't know that there's another one that I'm prepared to talk about today as the next investment. We still have, so Treasury Management for example, we rolled out, but it was Phase 1. We still have Phase 2 of Treasury Management that'll come out in early calendar 2018. So, we still have a very big focus on Treasury Management. Our Enterprise Risk Mitigation solution, the partnership with SAS. We've just rolled that out as we indicated in a recent press release. But we still have another version of that that we have to come. Our Biller Direct solution, our final major release for Biller Direct will happen in about halfway through next calendar year. So, most of what we're doing right now is kind of finishing the big projects that we've been working on including Episys. So, we've talked in the past about the fact that we've had this Episys database project going on. We've been rolling out incremental releases for the last three years to our customers. That will wrap up in calendar year 2018. So, we're not trying to put another big deal into the funnel right now. It's really finishing out all these big projects that we've had going on including by the way, Banno. I shouldn't have left Banno out. So the complete digital experience for our customers including mobile and online, that will do the first big online installs in, starting in January, February timeframe. So, mostly it's focused on getting all these things through the pipe that we have right now. Obviously there are other things that we're putting through the review process to see what goes in the pipe after that. But we've got to finish a lot of these projects that we have going on right now. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. And, for example the Enterprise Risk Mitigation solution that Dave mentioned, I mean, what we have in beta now is the first module, and I think there is a total of five modules. So, there's four more yet to be developed that are in some phase of the process right now. But that's probably a two-year process to get all of those completely developed and rolled out. So, we've got a lot of things going on. We've got a lot of really cool new solutions out there with a whole lot more to come. Rayna Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This is ends the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Tyrone. Again, we're pleased with the results from our ongoing operations and the efforts that all of our associates that take care of our customers.

Davidson Companies Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Jack Henry & Associates' Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer. Please, go ahead sir. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Kristi. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for the Jack Henry & Associates second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer, and on the call with me today is David Foss, our President and CEO. The agenda for this morning will be fairly normal. In a minute, I'll turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the state of the business and the performance for the quarter. Following that, I'll provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday, give some updated guidance and then I will open the lines up for Q&A. I need to remind you the remarks and responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with the expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another quarter with record revenue and earnings. As I've discussed many times, we can't achieve these results without the dedication and hard work of our associates, so I want to begin today by thanking them for continuing to provide outstanding solutions and service to our clients. As you've already seen, there is a bit of noise in our numbers this quarter as a result of the tax law changes and the Ensenta acquisition. I'll focus my comments on the performance of our team with regard to ongoing operations and let Kevin break down the impacts of these unusual events in his remarks. Total revenue increased 8% for the quarter and increased 7% excluding the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters. Organic revenue growth was also 7% for the quarter. We had a very solid quarter on the core side of our business. Revenue increased by 12% for the quarter and increased by 11% if you exclude the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters. Our payments businesses also continue to perform well posting a 6% increase in revenue this quarter and a 6% increase excluding the impact of deconversion fees. Our complementary solutions business also posted a 6% increase in revenue for the quarter and a 5% increase excluding the impact of deconversion fees. Our combined sales team had a very solid second quarter, finishing slightly ahead of quota. The core teams closed 16 new core deals, all of which were competitive takeaways, with nine on the banking side and seven on the credit union side. We also continued to see solid success with several of our key strategic solutions like Treasury Management, our new card offering and our Enterprise Risk Mitigation Solution. As we've discussed in the past, we're continuing to move customers to our new card processing solution. We converted two banks in December and two more a couple of weeks ago. All conversions have been extremely successful. And all four banks are already taking reference calls. We will implement several other beta clients in the coming months and plan to start large scale card conversions in calendar Q2. In late December, we announced the acquisition of Ensenta in Silicon Valley. We've combined this business with our Enterprise Payment Solutions group. As we highlighted in the press release, this solution set is highly complementary to our existing remote deposit capture business. Ensenta also brings added functionality to address ATM capture, shared branching services and the government payments business. With regard to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we don't intend to announce $1,000 one-time bonuses as has become the rage. Instead, we'll be taking several steps in the coming months to share a portion of our tax savings with our associates do more meaningful and impactful programs. The first is a voluntary program for employees with significant tenure to pursue retirement or other opportunities. Kevin will highlight the financial impact of this program in his remarks and will include other planned impacts in his guidance in the future. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Dave. The Services & Support line of revenue, which includes license, hardware, invitation services, in-house maintenance, bundled services and outsourcing increased 7% compared to the prior year quarter, or 6% if you exclude the deconversion fees from both quarters. Deconversion fees were up $2.8 million compared to year ago, and all of the deconversion fees were in this line of revenue. The Processing line of revenue, which includes online bill pay, card processing, and remittance or remote deposit capture along with transaction and digital fees were up 8% compared to the prior year quarter. As Dave mentioned, total revenue is up 8% as reported or 7% excluding deconversion fees for both quarters. Our reported consolidating operating margins were flat at 25% this quarter compared to last year. However, by excluding the deconversion fees from both quarters, our total operating margins decreased slightly from 23.6% to 23.3%. And this decrease is due entirely to three things : increased expense on our new payment platform and faster payments initiative that we've discussed from previous calls; our increased education conference cost due to combining ProfitStars and our JHA Banking Conference this year, which we did not even hold the ProfitStars Conference last year; and then also a small operating loss from the combined acquisitions that we did in the first half of the year. For our segments, our operating margins were relatively flat. In our core segment, our margins were 56% this quarter, compared to 55.7% last year's quarter. Without deconversion fees, core improved again, 54.4% from 54.2%. In our payments segment, we had some headwinds from, again, the additional costs from our new payments platform and faster payments initiatives. Our margins decreased from 54% last year to 53.1% this year. Without deconversions, they decreased about the same 52.8% to 51.9%. Complementing margins remain relatively flat at 58.5% both years and 57.8% versus 57.9% excluding deconversions last year. Our effective tax rate, which is, obviously, impacted significantly by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, due to the adjustment of our deferred tax liabilities on the balance sheet from the old rate to the new. Excluding the effects of the TCJA and other tax reserve adjustments during the quarter, our effective tax rate for the quarter actually increased to 34.5% from 33.5% last year, which negatively impacted our EPS by a little over a penny (7:17) in the quarter. Due to our fiscal year end, we will have a blended tax rate this year with half the year under the old rules and half the year under the new rules. Therefore, even though we continue to incorporate the sweeping tax changes of the TCJA, as of now, we project our effective tax rate in each of the next two quarters to be approximately 27% to 28%. For cash flow included in the total amortization, which was disclosed in the press release and the cash reserve review last night, is the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions, which increased slightly to $7.4 million year-to-date this fiscal year compared to $7.3 million last year. Our free cash flow, which is defined as operating cash flow, less capital expenditures, cap software and proceeds from sale of assets, was $112.3 million year-to-date this year compared to $94.2 million last year, or a hefty 19% increase. Year-to-date, we've deployed our capital by investing $65.2 million back into our company through CapEx and developing products, which is down from $70.5 million a year ago. We've also returned $77.9 million to shareholders year-to-date through stock buybacks and dividends. Our return on equity for the trailing 12 months was 32% or 32% if you exclude the one-time impacts of the TCJA. At 12/31, we had $100 million drawn on our revolver related to the Ensenta acquisition in late December; however, we still have significant capacity on our revolver facility and, basically, an unlevered balance sheet, which provides significant flexibility as we go forward. Some comments about the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and some of our plans regarding the benefits we will get from those. As Dave mentioned, we are providing a voluntary program for early departure of certain long-term employees, which some of the expected benefits that we will achieve from this plan are : it offers a simple exit path for seasoned long-term associates and they will benefit financially with a calculated severance amount; it allows for talent movement within the company by creating opportunities for upward promotional paths throughout the organization; it will also allow us to zero base these certain roles and either not replace or have the benefit of replacing with the right resource. It should also provide a savings in FY 2019 as not all positions will need to be backfilled or could be backfilled at a lower base pay rate. However, as I said, those electing to depart will benefit financially, which will be a cost for us in Q4 for the severance allowance that we will provide. Based on the eligible participants that we estimate that this will be a one-time cost of approximately $8 million in Q4. However, we will have a better idea when we report Q3, but that is the amount I'm currently including in my guidance. In addition, we'll be discussing other plans for potential uses of the benefits from TCGA (sic) [TCJA] later this week with our Board of Directors at our normal quarterly meeting. Obviously, we have historically increased dividends this quarter and I would anticipate that we will do that again this quarter. Some other uses will be directed at employees in the future, which provide ongoing benefits to them and possibly some enhancements to our current benefits plans. However, those are all longer-term and we do not expect any impact on current fiscal year other than those items already discussed. And we will build any other plans into our future FY 2019 guidance. And as for the remainder of FY 2018 guidance, we projected at the beginning of the year that our revenue from deconversion fees caused by the M&A activity would decrease in FY 2018 and cause a headwind, which even though Q2 was up a little, we were still down by $3 million year-to-date. This will continue to cause some noise, but we will continue to provide the deconversion revenue on a quarterly basis, so you can see how our true operations are performing. Also, as we discussed on previous calls, there will be some revenue headwind, increased cost and margin pressure from recent divestitures, and also getting our new payment platform in place to get our payment customers converted to that platform over the next couple of years. Therefore, for our fiscal Q3, we expect reported GAAP revenue to continue growing in the 6% to 7% range. Previous consensus had our EPS for Q3 at $0.79, which we commented last quarter that we were comfortable with that. However, with the impact of the currently projected lower effective tax rate of 28%, our Q3 EPS should be in the $0.85 to $0.86 EPS range. For Q4, we expect reported GAAP revenue growth in the 5% to 6% with slightly lower deconversion fees, but the anticipated additional expense impact of $8 million from the plan previously discussed, offset by the lower estimated effective tax rate, we expect EPS in Q4 to be in the range of $0.90 to $0.91, which that would make the full-year EPS in the range of $4.57 to $4.59. Obviously, there could be changes due to higher than expected deconversion fees or lower deconversion fees, stock buybacks or changes in our estimated effective tax rates, which we will provide updates in future earnings calls. For FY 2019, we anticipate that our total effective tax rate will be in the 24% to 25% range. Also we anticipate doing a full retro restatement of reporting previous numbers for ASC 606, the new revenue standards that will be effective for us July 1, 2018, which we will also provide more clarity about that on our next earnings call as we start looking more into FY 2019. This concludes our opening comments and we are now ready to take questions. Kristi, will you please open the call lines up for questions. Operator : Our first question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Thank you, good morning. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : You highlighted 16 new core deals in the quarter, 9 from banks, 7 from credit unions all competitive takeaways. Any key themes in the signings, any particular wins due to certain product lines, anything to call out? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: No, David, I don't know if there's anything in particular, it's pretty consistent with what we've been seeing for quite some time across the board, wins as far as the other core products that are out there, so nothing major or significant to call out. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: And not heavily weighted towards any one other core provider out there. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Not one core product. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Core product. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Okay. Understood. And then second, any update you have on banks' spending intentions for calendar 2018 would be helpful, just given U.S. tax reform, rising interest rates, which likely help net interest margin. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, it's a good question. We have talked about it in the last two earnings calls, I think, that the bank spending seemed to pick up a little bit last year. I think it's holding pretty consistent. I will tell you that our sales teams ended Q2 with the largest pipeline they've ever had, those \u2013 that doesn't mean they turn into deals. But it's the largest pipeline in the history of the company. But when you talk to bankers, there's not some great big flood of intention to go spend at a much higher rate. I think most of our clients are still waiting to see the actual impact of tax reform on their business. They're still trying to decide what to do with the savings that they have. I assume that at some point, we'll see some of that trickle into technology spending, but no major changes that I'm prepared to highlight right now. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Understood. And then there's been a lot of focus at least in the journal on continued bank closures, I think, an article yesterday calling out the last 12 months is the biggest year for bank closures. Is all that flowing through to increased demand for mobile and Internet banking? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I'm assuming you mean branch closures, not bank closures, right? David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : I'm sorry, branch closures. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, so that would make sense. So, yeah, that's certainly stimulating demand for mobile. Our newer mobile solution is the Banno solution. We've continued to see good demand. We signed 28 new customers in the quarter for Banno Mobile. So I think your thesis there is probably on target that certainly some of that is being driven by continued branch closure and more focus on putting mobile technology in the hands of the consumer, so they don't have to have as many branches. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Great. Quick final question, Kevin, you highlighted the unleveraged balance sheet. Obviously, you've had a great balance sheet for a while. Are you changing the way you think about capital allocation now in light of tax reform? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: No, not really David. As I said in the opening comments, I mean, obviously, we've increased dividends now for 26 consecutive fiscal years. This is typically the quarter that we increased dividend. So, I would anticipate that we'll do that. We might increase that a little more than typical. But again that's up to the board. We will use some of the additional cash, as I said, for some employee plans that we're strategizing right now. We're actually going to be talking to the board about those this week too. But it does give us some additional cash, so it gives us the opportunity to maybe look at some potential M&A activity out there a little stronger. But, I'll tell you that the other thing and I've talked to our board about this, is in my mind and maybe I'm a little overly conservative, but we have to be a little cautious that we don't put some plans in place that then if administration changes in two to three years and all of a sudden these tax laws change and go away and we lose that benefit, we don't want to set ourselves up into a position that now we have to pull back dividends or change something for employees because now all of a sudden the free cash is gone. So we're going to be a little cautious as we move forward. So that's a long way to answer your short question that I don't think there's many changes in the way we're going to deploy our capital. We're kind of going to continue going. Obviously, if the market continues correcting, gives us an opportunity to probably get in and buy some more of our stock back, which we've done that historically, so that's part of the way we're going to go forward, Dave. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Understood. Thank you very much. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Huff of Stephens. Your line is open. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning, guys. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Morning, Brett. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Two questions from me. One \u2013 or actually three, two on product. You mentioned a little bit about success in the press release of converting some folks to the issuing processing solution. And Kevin, I think, you said middle of fiscal 2020 is when you thought that the kind of full conversion would be done and you could start shutting some of the old systems down. Knowing what we know now, is that still the reasonable outlook timeline? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. That's the reason, Brett. And remember, we've got two platforms. So we've got two mainframe systems out there. And obviously, we have the backup systems for both those. And we're trying to get it where, hopefully, we can get the customers off one of those sooner rather than later. So we can go ahead and start taking some costs out and start getting some margins improvement. So we are continuing to see some headwinds now that the costs in the quarter for those initiatives increase our cost base by about $700,000. So there is true cost in there. And as we move these customers over to the new platform, we're going to have to pay transaction fees on those. So there is going to continue to be some margin pressure, but we still anticipate and, obviously, we're still pretty early in it. But like Dave mentioned that the first four conversions have gone really well and so we think we're still on track to hit the target, to have them all moved over by mid-2020. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. And then, on the enterprise fraud offering with your partnership with SAS, you're reselling SAS, how is that going? And kind of updates on that, it seems like that's a very unique offering in the space. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. We feel really good about it. We have five customers that are installed live now, Brett. We signed seven more in the quarter. Customer feedback, customer reaction has been very positive. And I think it's because most bankers knew about SAS, but SAS they were only targeted at the largest banks in the world. They had really no model to go below a $50 billion bank as far as their delivery model. And so, most bankers knew about SAS, but always assume that that would never be an option for them. So, they're very excited about the fact that they get access to this technology, industry-leading technology, hosted by Jack Henry. So they don't have to go through the full install onsite at their financial institution and they get the analytics, all the tools that are available through the SAS offering. So there's a good buzz out there right now. As I said, we signed seven more in the quarter. So, I'm optimistic about that solution for the future. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: And I'll go ahead and sort of plug in that that the ERMS solution and the faster payments and the card processing and Banno will all be at the Mini Tech Fair as part of our Analyst Day on May 7 in Atlanta, Georgia, which invites, we'll be going out shortly for that. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: I'm excited to see that one. Last question was a just sort of a numbers one and I think I missed part of this. Kevin, can you remind us what you thought term fees were going to be and what they came in at, was there a difference in those in terms of the timing? I was trying to write, I don't think I got it all down. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Well, right now, our term fees were $2.8 million ahead of where they were last year. In Q2, we actually thought Q2 was going to be relatively flat. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. So they came in a little early, does that mean that those term fees, call it, $3 million that came in this time, won't \u2013 they came out of 3Q and 4Q? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: No. There's no rhyme or reason when these things happen, Brett. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I mean, it's one of those things, if I'm throwing a dart at the wall, you have no idea when it's going to hit. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: And so, does that \u2013 did you give us \u2013 because I think, before, you said the full year is going to be up $8 million or down $8 million. I can't remember; one or the other. Is that number changed? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: No. It's down $8 million, which we're still down about $3 million year-to-date; and, like I said in my opening comments, I think Q4 is going to be down from where it was last year, which is why the guidance on revenue growth in Q4 was down a little bit. So, we may not be down $8 million, but I think we're still going to be down probably $5 million to $6 million for the full year. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's what I needed. Thanks, guys. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Hi. So I want to get a sense of how fast outsourcing grew and were there any de novo wins? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Whether there were any de novo wins? Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : I'm just \u2013 maybe just give me a sense of like how fast outsourcing grew? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: So, as far as the number of customers that we signed in the quarter, I think we signed nine banking clients and seven new core clients. The majority of them were outsourced. I think all of the banking clients were, and I think four of the credit union clients, so all of those will add to revenue in the future. And then, in the out signings \u2013 and out meaning customers moving from in-house to outsourcing \u2013 we signed four on the banking side and five on the credit union side. That doesn't impact the financials in the quarter, but it sets us up for the future. And I'm just talking while Kevin's looking up the number as far as the actual change in the quarter, if you want to... Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, in true outsourcing and cloud services, actually grew right at 10% for the quarter, which is pretty much in line with the guidance we've provided. Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Okay. And any of those credit unions over $1 billion in assets? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: We didn't sign any this quarter as far as new customers. We did \u2013 one of the in-to-outs that we signed was a $3 billion credit union, but there aren't that many over $1 billion credit unions, so it's common for a quarter to go by without signing a new one. We had the year, a couple of years ago, where we signed six in one year, which was pretty remarkable, but it's rare to sign a $1 billion credit union; but, we have some in our pipeline. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. There are several in the pipeline. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Okay. And then, the last one for me just on the margin trajectory, can you give us some color through the end of this year and any thoughts on what margins could do next year? Thanks. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. And like I said, with all the initiatives we have with faster payments and different things, I mean, it's going to create some headwinds on margins. Overall, operating margins were down slightly this quarter. I think they're going to probably be down, again, the next couple of quarters, but I think we're continuing to get leverage in other areas that's helping to offset those headwinds. So there's going to continue to be some slight margin pressure, but they should be relatively flat in FY 2019. Obviously, we'll give updated guidance later, but they should remain relatively flat to slightly down as we get all of these customers migrated over. Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Okay. Thank you. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Hey, good morning, Dave and Kevin. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Hey, Dave, you talked about that the pipeline in this second quarter was probably the largest you've seen in company history. I'm wondering, if you just talk about maybe the products that are creating this demand and what are you winning. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. It's across the board, and that's the thing that's really kind of heartening for me is our core business continues strong, signing 16 in a quarter is a, as far as I'm concerned, remarkable number, 16 takeaways in a quarter, but we didn't totally deplete the pipeline on the core side. So core is strong. On the complementary side, we have lots of interest in the new payment solution that we highlighted earlier, the First Data and PSCU partnerships, so a number of deals in the pipeline there. And then, across the board, not only our newer solutions, like Banno and Treasury Management and Enterprise Risk Management, but across the suite, it's really kind of a robust pipeline across the board. So I wouldn't say there is anything that's particularly standing out other than the fact that the core business continues to look strong. After signing 16 in the quarter, I was a little worried that there'd be a big drop off, but there's still a lot in the pipeline as far as new core deals that are working. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well, another thing, Kartik, is actually all three brands'... David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: ...sales pipelines are extremely robust right now. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : And then, what about \u2013 I know, Kevin, you said term fees are going to be down this year compared to last year, but thoughts on bank consolidation, if you're seeing any activity that would lead you to believe that maybe we're going to see more bank consolidation as we head into year FY 2019? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: All right. Again, I don't think it's going to pick up. I mean, it's going at about the same pace. I would tell you that our M&A teams are extremely busy, which means that our banks are buying quite a few banks out there just like we're losing some that are getting acquired by other banks. But yeah, I don't see much of a trend. I mean I think it's going to be in the 3% to 4% consolidation rate just like it has been for the last 15 or 20 years. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I think we highlighted two calls ago, Kartik, that we had added a conversion team just to handle M&A, another M&A team. And they've been in place, they are running in full steam. We don't anticipate any more right now. But the fact that we had to add one a couple of quarters ago, indicates that there's a lot of \u2013 and when we add a team, it's because our banks are acquiring other banks and so we end up doing the conversion work and so that pace is continuing pretty steady. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : And then just, Kevin, just a clarification, when you were talking about margins, I think you said initially you thought FY 2019 would be flat. And I'm wondering would you not have the benefit that you're not going to have the $8 million expense next year that you're going to have this year for early retirement and won't there be some savings associated with that? So I just wanted to make sure that, maybe I was thinking about this the right way. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah you're absolutely right, Kartik. I mean that won't be in there, but the other thing that I would say is that, and Dave and I both mentioned that, we have some other things that we're going to be doing for some of our associates throughout the organization, which could easily offset that $8 million. So we probably will have that same expense, if not more in FY 2019. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you, both. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Thank you and good morning. I have two questions somewhat related to Kartik's. But Kevin, if we can just go back through what you're talking about with sort of the programs et cetera for employees, just part of the tax saves. Ultimately, I guess, is there a way to think about the benefit in terms of average comp per FTE, I think, you talked about sort of creating some opportunities to bring on talent, maybe at lower compensation levels. And I'm just sort of trying to think is there another way to think about the ongoing benefit, once you get past some of the step up and implementation of a variety of programs. Yeah, go ahead. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, Tim, the problem is because of a program like this, we offered it to tenured personnel, which they have to be at certain age and they have to have a certain number of years with Jack Henry, and so that covers a pretty wide gamut of salaries that could be anywhere from a $30,000 salary to $150,000 salary. And we have no idea or no way of knowing which ones will actually accept this because it's truly totally voluntary. Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Now, like I said, when we report Q3, I will have that number and I'll be able to say you what's basically the impact is going to be on Q4 and in FY 2019. Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Perfect. Thank you. That'll be great. I guess, sort of on the same topic, just thinking about sort of freeing up upward mobility et cetera for other associates, have you been seeing anything internally around recruiting or retention or just employee satisfaction did sort of \u2013 has created maybe an impetus to do this or is this something you guys have been thinking about for quite a while and you sort of get an opportunity here to do it without really disrupting the income statement? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, that's a good question, Tim. This is Dave. So we do, I think you're aware, we do employee engagement surveys every year, employee satisfaction surveys every year, we follow through with programs based on those on an annual basis. One thing we've talked about with some of you guys and some investors on occasion is the fact that our turnover rate is very low, it's about half the industry standard rate. Well, there's really good news and potentially bad news on that. The really good news is, you're not having this constant churn in the talent. The potential bad news is as you have really talented people who want to move up, sometimes they're blocked because, again, we have very low turnover. So, it's something that comes up, there's not some mass concern among the associates at our company about this topic, but it does come up. And so, this was an opportunity for us to create some movement and give some people that really have proven themselves, give some people the chance to move up in the organization and take on more responsibility. And at the same time, as Kevin has already highlighted, we believe it will have an impact as far as reducing overall compensation. Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. My last question was just \u2013 go ahead, Kevin, I'm sorry. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Tim, we do have a number of retention programs that goes on and training programs for our associates, so we can identify which ones are those up-and-comers and make sure that they are aligned appropriately and that we have identified to where we want them to go. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. And the last question I have is just on the recent acquisition. I think you guys have been pretty successful over the years buying products, where you saw an opportunity to scale across a much larger customer base and sales force. I'm just sort of curious is this \u2013 this is, obviously, a reasonable mature company, I guess, with the purchase price, but I think when you look at their product set, your sales force, your customers, is this again just another one of those sort of transactions where you see a real opportunity to step up the growth rate by getting it into your product set, your sales force, your distribution channels or how should we think about the ramp and the performance of it? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. That's the idea, you've nailed it. The Ensenta team was very complementary to what we do with our Enterprise Payment Solutions business. So, if you look at our traditional business EPS, we are very strong on the banking side of the house, not so much on the credit union side. We're very strong with commercial businesses, not so much with consumers. Now you look at Ensenta, they're very strong with consumers, very strong on the credit union side, very much about mobile capture as opposed to our traditional business, which was scanner capture. So you put the two together, they're very complementary to each other. The sales force that we already have at Jack Henry knows how to sell these things because we've been doing it for years. So we put that in the hands of our sales force and, by doing this, we become the largest provider in this space because we were the largest on the banking side and, essentially, we're the largest on the credit union side, now combined together we'll be the largest provider of that type of technology. And on top of it, it brought us some things that we didn't have. So the ability to support shared branching in the credit union space, for example, of a more robust ATM capture solution and some government payments options. And so it's a really nice complementary addition to what we already had in place with EPS. Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks so much for the time. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Glen Greene of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Just a few questions, clarifications for Kevin first. Kevin, you gave an EPS outlook of $4.57 to $4.59, I assume that was the GAAP number. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yes. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Do you have the equivalent non-GAAP? What was the non-GAAP, more like $3.40 or something like that or $3.39? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: You mean without the impact of the tax? Yeah, it'd be something like that, Glenn. I don't have that off the top of my head. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. I just wanted to make sure we are okay. And then, just... Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: That is a true GAAP number with the impact of the Tax Cuts and Job Act (sic) [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act] in there for Q2 and beyond. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And could you just explain at a high level why the tax rate in the back half is that 27% to 28%, whereas it's going forward to 24% to 25%? Could you just walk through that, again? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Because, again, we're a fiscal year-end company, so the first half of our year is still at the 35% rate and the second half is at a blended rate, which is not down to the 24%, it's more like a 25% or 26% for the second half to get the blended rate down. So to get the full year impact of a 29% or so average, we're going to have to use 27% to 28% in the second half to get to a full year blended rate. It's just the way the IRS tax rules work. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Fine. And I jumped on the call a little bit late, but did you give any indication of what the number of outsourcing \u2013 in-to-outsourcing decisions was in the quarter? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I touched on a little bit ago; so, in-to-outs, we had four on the banking side and five on the credit union side. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, Kevin, I know it's early, but do you have a high-level view of the impact of ASC 606? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: No. I really don't. And I've said that in the opening comments, Glenn. I mean, we're still going through the conversion of all of our contracts in the system. We should have that completely converted. We've gone through one mock (36:48); we're going through another one. We should have that completely converted sometime in March. So then, we will be able to basically do dual reporting through the end of June, which is when ASC 606 actually comes into play for us. And so, when we report the end of the fiscal year, we will actually do retro reporting for the previous two years, and then going forward into FY 2019. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, Dave, maybe just a little bit more color on what you're seeing in the card processing side. Obviously, you're doing \u2013 in the process of converting a lot, but I'm interested in the incremental new demand from new clients on both the debit and the credit side, what you're seeing there. It's obviously early. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. So, we signed 17 new Banking debit customers in the quarter and four new Symitar debit customers in the quarter, and then three credit customers in the quarter. And, of course, those are all new because we didn't have credit in the past; so, good demand. As I mentioned earlier, the pipeline has a number of deals in it that are \u2013 some are renewals or customers renewing the business they already have, but a lot of new interest in this solution. We've had some good press from some of the consultants. And I've commented on it before, it's rare for the consultants to give you good press and \u2013 the industry consultants, and they've really been impressed with this solution. So still early days in this and we still have a lot of work to do to get customers converted over, but I think as we continue to show success in converting existing customers to the platform, that will only drive more demand not only from our existing customers, but from new prospects. So, I'm feeling very good right now about the solution and where we're at in the sales process. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: All right. Great. Thanks a lot. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is open. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hey, guys, thanks. And I guess one just quick follow-up on Glenn's question on tax rate. Are we right that Q2 was 34.5% tax rate normalized, I think, is what you said, and then Q3 and Q4, 27% to 28%, and then all next year you said 24% to 25%, those are all the right numbers, right? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yes. That is correct, Dave. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Okay. Good. And then, secondly, where does that $8 million cost fall? Is it in the cost of sales in one of the line items or is it in G&A? Where would that be? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: It will be wherever the person resides at, Dave. So the lion's share of it will be in cost of sales, but there'll be some in R&D and some in SG&A. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Got you. And then, I guess the last thing, is it fair to think of \u2013 I think you said \u2013 for growth in Q3, I think you said 6% to 7% reported. There's also, I guess, there's the 2% tailwind from acquisitions, and then a 1% headwind each from term fees and divestitures, so the net of all the stuff is kind of neutral. Is that the right way to think of Q3? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: That would be the right way to think about it. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Cool. I think, that's all we got. Thank you. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Dave. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Heckmann of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Alexis Huseby - D.A. Davidson Companies : Hi, guys. This is Alexis Huseby on for Pete. I'm hoping you can give some insight on what the margins look like in the Ensenta business, and then also has Jack Henry been licensing any tech from Ensenta? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: So, on the second question, have we been licensing any tech from Ensenta, was that the question? Alexis Huseby - D.A. Davidson Companies : Yes. Thank you. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, we did not have a relationship with Ensenta prior to the acquisition. They were a competitor of ours. So, we competed with them heads up. And as I highlighted earlier, they were much stronger than we were on the consumer side of the business, we were much stronger on the business, meaning serving business clients than they were, which is why we were so happy with the complementary nature of this acquisition. So, we were not licensing technology from them, they were a competitor. And as far as... Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. The margins currently are quite a bit lower than our corporate average, primarily because of the high depreciation and amortization, that's included in those because of purchase price accounting. Obviously, we've only owned them for 45 days now. So, it's a little tough to say we've gotten any of the synergies put in place yet, which those should be in there by the end of fiscal year. So basically by FY 2019, their margin should be up pretty much in line with our corporate average operating margins. Alexis Huseby - D.A. Davidson Companies : Okay, great, thank you. And then could you provide any update on Banno uptake? And is that planned to be replacing NetTeller product at all? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: So, the strategy is not for Banno to replace NetTeller unless the customer chooses to do that. NetTeller is a fully functioning very popular Internet banking solution. We have a mobile banking solution tied directly to it called goDough. A lot of customers use it. They're happy with it. There is no intent to displace those customers. Banno is designed to be kind of that premium solution sold, certainly, to some customers who're currently running NetTeller, but more focused on net new customers. So, we signed 28 new customers in the quarter and have signed 47 so far this fiscal year. Alexis Huseby - D.A. Davidson Companies : Great. Thanks. And then, finally, do you expect to see any uptick related to their current expected credit loss accounting standard requirements for loan portfolios? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: So, we rolled out our (42:34) solution, I don't know, about a year ago probably. And so, we already have \u2013 those sales have been happening for about a year and have been baked into our numbers for a year. So, I expect that'll just continue at the current trend. There won't be some big spike as a result of (42:51). We've been in that business now for about a year. Alexis Huseby - D.A. Davidson Companies : Okay, great. Thank you. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Kevin Williams for any further remarks. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Kristi. Again, we're pleased with the results from our ongoing operations and the efforts of all of our associates to take care of our customers. Our executives, managers, and all our associates continue to focus on what is best for our customers and our shareholders. I want to thank you again for joining us today. And Kristi, will you please provide the replay number? Operator : The replay number is 1-855-859-2056. Again, that is 1-855-859-2056. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program, and you may all disconnect. Thanks. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session; instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Kevin Williams. You may begin. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Lydia (00:38). Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the Jack & Associates (sic) [Jack Henry & Associates] (00:40) third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. I am Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer, and on the call with me today is David Foss, our President and CEO. The agenda for this morning will be opening comments by me, then I'll turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the state of the business and the performance for the quarter. And then, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market closed. And then, we will open the line up for Q&A. I need to remind you that remarks and responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate, due to a number of risks and uncertainties. And the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another quarter with record revenue and earnings. As in the past, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work that went into producing those results for our third fiscal quarter. Total revenue increased 9% for the quarter and increased 8% excluding the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters. Organic revenue growth was 7% for the quarter. We again had a very solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 7% for the quarter and also increased by 7% if you exclude the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters. Our Payments segment performed extremely well, posting a 12% increase in revenue this quarter and an 11% increase excluding the impact of deconversion fees. Of course, Ensenta is a contributor to this growth. But even if we exclude Ensenta, we saw more than a 5% increase in revenue through our traditional offerings. We also had a very strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, posting an 11% increase in revenue this quarter and a 10% increase excluding the impact of deconversion fees. Our combined sales team had another nice quarter, again finishing ahead of quota. As I mentioned in the press release, it also appears that the team is on track to exceed quota for the year. This was a well-balanced sales quarter with the sales teams posting solid numbers for several of our new solutions, including Banno, Debit Processing, the new Credit Processing Solution and Treasury Management. We also had a record number of Symitar into out signings at 13. Regarding our new first data PSU debit card offering, we now have 34 customers converted and live on the new platform. As with any conversion, we've encountered a few minor bumps, but I'm very happy to say that all of these customers are referenceable at this point. And as planned, we will begin to slowly ramp our conversion volume later in May. With regard to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we provided a very high level review of our plans in the last call, including plans to return a portion of the savings to our shareholders. Shortly after that call, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of 19%. We also discussed our intent to use a portion of the TCJA savings to offer a voluntary incentive plan which would provide a large subset of our longer tenured employees the option to leave the company with a significant financial reward. We projected a Q4 expense of around $8 million as a result of this program. As we have discussed with many of you in the past, our voluntary turnover rate runs well below the industry average. This tends to provide great stability in our workforce because once people join our company, they are generally inclined to stay. We saw this same behavior reflected in the results of this special incentive program in that even though we felt we had forecasted conservatively, many fewer people took advantage of the program than we had expected. Our Q4 charge therefore will be much closer to $5.5 million than the originally projected $8 million. We don't intend to offer another program like this, but as we move through FY 2019, we'll be announcing several other programs intended to benefit our employees, including an improved 401(k) offering and improved bonus structure and other changes designed to help us continue to attract and retain strong talent. Sticking with the topic of attracting and retaining the best talent in the industry, most of you are well aware of the fact that we regularly win Best Place to Work Awards around the country and in various publications. Yesterday afternoon, we were notified that this year we have again won as a Best Large Employer in the Forbes Magazine annual review. Last year, we were recognized as number 92 on the list of Top 500 Large Employers and number seven among the 26 technology companies. This year, we have moved up to number 12 overall and number 2 on the list of technology companies with Google as the only company scoring higher than Jack Henry. Obviously, we're extremely happy with these results and thankful that our employees have such a positive opinion of our company. As I'm sure you're all aware, we'll be hosting our Annual Analyst Conference in Atlanta next week in conjunction with the Jack Henry Banking Strategic Initiatives Conference for our largest core banking clients. We look forward to seeing many of you next week in Atlanta. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Dave. This high level of the service and support line of revenue, which includes our license, hardware, imitation (06:16) services, in-house maintenance, bundled services and outsourcing increased 8% compared to the prior quarter or 6% if you exclude the deconversion fees and revenue from acquisitions from both quarters. Our deconversion fees were up $3.8 million compared to year-ago quarter and all the deconversion fees were in this line of revenue for the quarter. Obviously, deconversion fees were a little higher than we anticipated. But like we've talked about before, we have no control of when those are going to happen. We did have a couple of larger several of customers that did get acquired and deconverted during the quarter. The processing line of revenue, which includes online bill pay, card processing and remittance or remote deposit capture along with transaction digital fees was up 10% compared to the prior quarter. Our total revenue, as Dave said, is up 9% as reported or 6% if you exclude all of the deconversion fees and revenues from acquisitions from both quarters. Our reported consolidated operating margins were flat at 25% this quarter compared to last year. However, by excluding the deconversion fees and impacts from acquisitions and divestitures from both quarters, as the table in the press release yesterday showed, our total operating margins were essentially flat at 22%. All of our segments performed well during the quarter, maintaining operating margins equal to or slightly ahead of last quarter. Our core was flat at 54% as reported or 51% without deconversion fees. Payments was flat at 53% and essentially the same without deconversion fees. Complementary went up slightly from 58% to 59% and actually stayed flat at 57% without deconversion fees. Our effective tax rate was obviously impacted again by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act due to the additional adjustment to our deferred tax liabilities on the balance sheet from the old rates to the new. As I said, we had to make an adjustment in the December quarter, but because we were fiscal year end we have to continue bring that rate down slightly over the second half of our fiscal year. Excluding the effects of the TCJA and other tax reserve adjustments during the quarter, our effective tax rate for the quarter actually increased to 33.7% from 32.1% last year, which has a slight negative impact on EPS by a little less than $0.02 for the quarter. As a reminder, due to our fiscal year end, we will have a blended tax rate this year with half the year under the old rules and half the year under the new rules. Therefore, even though we continue to incorporate these sweeping tax changes of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we project our effective tax rate in Q4 will be approximately 27%. For cash flow, included in the total amortization which was disclosed in the press release in the cash flow review is the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions, which increased slightly to $12.4 million year-to-date in fiscal year compared to $10.9 million last year. Our free cash flow, which is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, capitalized software and proceeds from sale of assets, was $138.5 million year-to-date this year, which compares to $95.4 million last year or 45% increase. Obviously, our free cash flow is still behind our net earnings, but remember that we will be sending out our annual maintenance billings for FY 2019 the first part of June. And we typically have an extremely strong both operating and free cash flows in Q4 and Q1 of each fiscal year. Year-to-date,we have deployed our capital by investing $97 million back into our company through CapEx and developing products, which is down from $106.7 million a year ago. We've also returned $106.4 million to shareholders year-to-date through stock buybacks and dividends. Our return on equity for the trailing 12 months was 32% or actually 23% if you exclude the impacts of the TCJA. At March 31, we had $105 million drawn on our revolver related to the Ensenta acquisition in late December. We still have significant capacity on our revolver facility and basically an unlevered balance sheet, which provides significant flexibility. Through our annual maintenance billings, we should have the revolver essentially paid down or close to paid down by the end of June. As for the remainder of FY 2018 guidance for Q4, as we discussed on last quarter's call, for Q4, we expect reported GAAP revenue growth to be in the 5% to 6% range and that still is as of today. But with the anticipated additional expense as Dave mentioned, the $5.5 million from the voluntary early departure plan, and then offset that by the lower estimate effective tax rate of 27% compared to last year, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.93 to $0.95 for Q4, which would make the full-year EPS in the range of $4.69 to $4.71. Obviously, there could be changes due to higher-than-expected deconversion fees, changes in effective taxes or other unexpected changes as I mentioned in the opening of the call. For FY 2019, as we continue incorporating the new tax laws, at this time, we anticipate our total effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% for FY 2019. We anticipate doing a full retro restatement of reporting the two previous years for the new Rev Rec Rules under ASC 606, which becomes effective for us on July 1, 2018. As of now, it appears that revenue growth should continue in the similar range of growth as we've seen in the current fiscal year. Obviously, we'll be able to provide much firmer FY 2019 guidance on our year-end call in mid-August after previous years have been recast under ASC 606, after we have incorporated the additional employee program changes mentioned previously by Dave, and after we have completed the implementation of all the tax law changes under TCJA. This concludes our opening comments and we are now ready to take questions. Lydia (12:23), will you please open the call lines up for questions? Operator : Our first question coming from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Your line is open. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning, guys. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, Brett. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Two questions. Number one, can you talk a little bit about the demand environment? Dave, you touched on it, but your two peers have been \u2013 last couple of days have talked a little bit more enthusiastically about acceleration of demand, particularly sales over the last couple of quarters. And just wondered how that matched with what you all are seeing if there's a meaningful difference here in the last six months? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: No, we're seeing the same thing. I think on the last call, if I remember right, I pointed out that our pipeline was larger than it's ever been in the history of the company. And so I would say we're seeing the same things. In fact, I have a couple of charts that I'm going to show you guys at the Analyst Conference next week from a recent study that came out on that very topic. But I would echo that. I think demand is strong. The sales pipeline is solid. The sales team has exceeded quota every quarter so far this year, which is remarkable as far as I'm concerned. So, things are good on the sales front. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. And then the other question is, we're pretty focused and intrigued by the new card issuing processing product that you guys are developing. Two questions on that. One, is it still about a year-and-a-half out before we start getting some margin sort of moderate \u2013 a margin impact moderation as we kind of close down some of the other two switches, number one? And then number two, I think you said 34 live. Can you give us a sense, are the banks bigger than you thought? Is the volume coming on faster than you thought and kind of how are the economics playing out relative to what you expected? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. I think so, 34 live. We have, I think, 19 more that will be live by the time we get together next Monday. So, I can give you another update at the Analyst Conference on Monday, but it's a broad mix. So as with any project like this, it's probably logical to you that we wouldn't start with our largest customers. We would start with a few smaller ones. But so far, other than the first four, after that, it's been a good mix as far as volume, a good mix as far as number of cardholders. And these conversions, I should knock on wood when I say it, but they really have gone flawlessly and I think a big reason for that is because the consumer, there's no impact to the consumer. They don't have to issue new cards. It's really a seamless conversion for the consumer, so progress will continue. We'll continue to give you updates on progress and a little more information on volumes as we get farther down the road. But so far, it's been extremely successful and the timeline at the beginning of your question, it's still in the ballpark. We'll see again as we start to ramp up how quickly can we ramp, can we do more than we thought every month, will we end up doing fewer than we thought, so we'll give you more guidance on that as time goes by as well. But right now, it's progressing extremely well and I'm very optimistic about the future of that project. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: I guess one \u2013 sorry. Sorry. Go ahead, Kevin. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. On the margin side, the other thing that I've talked about before is the timing of when we can get all the customers off one of the platforms because obviously when that happens, we'll be able to take a significant amount of cost out and that's not going to happen at the same time. So, we're not going to get all the customers off both platforms at the same time. So, there is going to be one quarter that's going to get a nice bump in margins because we're going to be able to take a significant amount of cost out for that one and then when we get all of the customers off of the other one, you're going to see a very nice bump in the margin. So, as Dave said, the timing is still about the same. We've been doing pretty good at maintaining our margins in the payments side because I will tell you, we've taken on a lot of costs for the additional labor to help with these migrations. And so far, we've managed to kind of offset those margins. We haven't seen quite the deprivation that I thought, but we got more cost coming on. And again, it comes down to the timing of when can we start getting new credit card customers on the new platform because that's new revenue that we've never sold before, so the faster we can start getting some of that and seeing that, which I'm not giving you any guidance there, but that will help also offset those margins as we move forward over the next 18 months or so. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: And I guess one more question while I have you, the other interesting product that you guys, I think, have rolling out or you have a bunch of them, but the other one that we're focused on is the enterprise fraud product with the corporation SAS. I think that's targeted at larger banks and I'm wondering how are those conversations going, anything live there and are you seeing anything surprising in terms of \u2013 if the medium- and smaller-sized banks are also perking up on that. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. It's a good question because you're exactly right. So, we have a handful live. I think we have two or three live right now, but you're exactly right. We originally thought this was only going to be appealing to the largest banks in our core base. Knew there might be some interest in the credit union side of the house, but really no interest among smaller, either banks or credit unions, and it's been very different from that. There is a lot of demand around midsized and larger banks and a number of our credit unions. So that one I think is going to turn into a broader success than what we maybe originally thought. So, we've already signed 10 so far. We have two or three lives and we're pretty optimistic about that opportunity in the future. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Great. That's all I had, appreciate it. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Brett. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Hi. Can you talk about the deceleration in 4Q? What's causing the slowdown? And any color on termination fees and I guess some other color on 4Q? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well, term fees we expect to be flat in Q4. The slight deceleration in total revenue is just kind of comparable to Q4 last year. We try to be cautious with our guidance and we feel pretty solid. That 5% to 6% growth in Q4 is pretty much in line and we'll probably right on over into FY 2019, Joe. Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Okay. And then just as we talk about FY 2019, I know you gave some color on the cash flows in I think 4Q and 1Q, but maybe could talk about your expectations for cash flows versus net income next year and also on the DSO side? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well, as far as cash flows, we have \u2013 we peaked in our cap software a year ago, we saw that came down a little bit last year. It's going to be \u2013 if we're on track, could be down a little bit this year. I think it's going to probably come down a little bit more next year. We don't have huge internal software developments going on. So, those are going to contribute to increased free cash flow. And then, obviously, the impact of the lower tax rates is going to drop straight to free cash flow as well. So, I think in FY 2019, tentatively, again, there's still a lot of moving parts, but I think in FY 2019 our free cash flow should get back up above our net income. Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Got it. Okay. And then the last one for me, you mentioned the pickup in demand. Where we would most likely be able to see that? Would that come through your digital products, standard products or both, whether it be the insourcing to outsourcing move? I'm just wondering if there was an area where you thought you're most likely to see some upside, which area would that be in? Thanks. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, that's a good question. And it really is across the board. I will tell you so, for sure, digital, and we've talked about that a lot. We have an outstanding digital offering and the strategy that the customers are really zoning in on. So, digital is an opportunity. We do have \u2013 we've talked for many years about the in-to-out opportunities, customers moving from in-house to outsourcing. That's been a steady performer for us on the banking side for many years, but the credit union side there wasn't that much demand in the past. We've seen an uptick there. I highlighted it in my opening comments and then several of these new products that we rolled out. There was a reason why we focused on some of these new solutions like treasury management and like the card offering and certainly demand in those areas as well. So I'd say it's across the board as far as ongoing demand. Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Great. Thank you. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of David Koning with Baird. Your line is now open. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hey, guys. Nice job, again. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Dave. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hey, and so, I guess, on the payments side, you mentioned \u2013 I think you mentioned 11% growth ex-term and over 5% ex-term and Ensenta. I think the last couple of quarters were 4% to 5%. It was on a really tough comp last year too, so you accelerated on a tougher comp. Is there something you're doing specifically or is there something environmental? It seemed like Visa and MasterCard both accelerated really nicely in debit and maybe you're feeling some of that as well? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I don't know that it's \u2013 so I've talked about it before that our EPS business, which is our Enterprise Payment Solutions, the ACH origination business, as surprising as it is to me, in 2018, that business continues to grow and continues to perform well. So, obviously, that's a win. I think the growth in the card business was a little ahead of probably what might have been logical to expect and so that's continuing to perform well. Bill Pay is a steady performer for us, so there's no spike in any particular area. I wouldn't tie anything in particular to anything that's happening with debit with one of the card associations, but it's just across the board. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: The one thing I would throw out, Dave, and we talked about this a lot in the previous calls, two or three calls ago, that when we announced this, the PSCU-FDC arrangement to our larger customers, I mean, we stopped a lot of those customers that were in an RFP process. So I think just the fact that we stopped losing customers because of the new platform makes it easier comps going forward for the payments line. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got you, yeah. Okay. Great. And then, I guess secondly on margins, they've held up well this year and you've kind of talked about you know ex-term fees they were pretty flat year-over-year, which is good especially given the development costs and some of the new onboarding with the double debit processing system. When is like the inflection point where margins actually like start to go up again year-over-year? Is that like six months out? Is it like late fiscal 2019? How should we think about that? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well, there's a couple of things, Dave. First of all, you've got obviously all the development, but also the additional head count that we've brought in to assist with the migrations for the move to the new payments platform. And those costs are going to be around for the next 18 months or so. At that point when we get all the customers off one of the platforms, we will shut down our platforms, we'll be getting rid of or displacing a lot of development people and a lot of the migration staff. So, you're going to see a really nice pop in margins there. The other thing that we're having to kind of grow over is all the development we've done on all these products in the previous three or four years for the treasury services, the ERMS solution and all those. So, depreciation and amortization are both up quite a bit, and so we've got the cost that's rolling out there, but yet we still \u2013 now we're just getting the sales going and so we're going to have to ratchet up the live customers on those to even offset the increase in amortization and depreciation. So, that's going to happen slowly over the next probably three or four quarters that we'll be able to grow over that. And that should give a little relief on margins or at least help to maintain the margins where we are to offset the increased costs for the move on the payments platform. And then when we get to shut down the payments platforms, that's when you're going to see a huge increase in margins because, again, that's over 20% of our total revenue right now that you're going to see a significant pop in margins. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Okay. Great. And then just the final one. What did you say for full-year EPS for fiscal 2018 again? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: For fiscal 2018, well, we're going to finish this quarter at $0.93 to $0.95, which will put us full year with the impacts of TJCA in the $4.69 to $4.71 range. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, on a GAAP basis, but normalized it's more around $3.50 or somewhere around there I think? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Okay. Great. Well, thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Dave. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson & Company. Your line is open. Peter J. Heckmann - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. I had a couple of questions. This is maybe a little bit looking out a little longer term. On a theoretical basis, how do you feel about selling to FinTech disruptors, some, I'm reading a lot in American Banker as well some of the other publications about some of these new companies coming out offering a lightweight core maybe offering payment capabilities. On a theoretical basis, are you marketing to those or you view that as something that impacts negatively your target market of regular banks and credit unions? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. That's a good question, Pete. It's a fine line that we walk in that discussion. We're committed to the idea that we are not going to set ourselves up to be a competitor with our traditional customers. So with that in mind, where are those opportunities where we can maybe partner with a traditional customer to enable them with a FinTech. So, we are not \u2013 we are open to the idea instead of two negatives here. I'll say, we're open to the idea of working some of those partnerships. We have some of those discussions ongoing today, but we're very careful about the point of not positioning ourselves to compete with our traditional customers. And by the way, to your point about the lightweight core and being nimble and gathering online deposits, that's actually a topic in my discussion for next week because we are \u2013 we will be offering that type of solution to our customers with products that are solutions that we already have at Jack Henry. So, we're well-positioned to compete in that space with what we already have. Peter J. Heckmann - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay, that's helpful. And then just a followup on Ensenta, I've read through via description of what Ensenta does and I've read through some of your material and I guess I'm still not completely clear on some of the additional capabilities that Ensenta brought to Jack Henry and maybe you give us some examples of other areas where it either solidified a lead or added new capabilities. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. So if you think about our traditional Enterprise Payments business, we were very strong in commercial deposits, working with commercial customers, particularly on the banking side of our business. So, we're the most widely installed solution in that space. We had some penetration on the Credit Union side and we had some penetration for consumer deposits, but we were not industry leader in that space and the reason we weren't the industry leader is because Ensenta was. So, if you put Ensenta together with our EPS platform, we have the industry leading solution for commercial deposits, consumer deposits, mobile deposits, essentially across the board. Additionally, Ensenta brought to us a technology for working in the ATM environment that we didn't have and the shared branching environment on the Credit Union side for processing payments. Neither of those were huge part of their business, but it broadened our suite which of course is what we're always looking to do on the ProfitStars. This is a ProfitStars solution by the way. So, we're always looking to broaden that offering on the ProfitStars side to try and fill as many holes as we can for those customers who do business with ProfitStars and of course many of them are non-core Jack Henry customers. So, we have to have a best of breed very broad offering to be competitive in that space. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: They also brought us some best of breed risk solution. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yes. Right. Yeah, risk management technology around payments that we \u2013 we had a very solid offering, but they had a better offering. So, that augmented that piece of our story as well. Peter J. Heckmann - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Got you. Okay, that's helpful. See you Monday. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Pete. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Kevin Williams for closing remarks. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Lydia (30:37). As Dave mentioned, I want to remind everyone that we are having our Annual Analyst Day next Monday afternoon at The Omni in Atlanta, which the afternoon presentations will be webcast. We're doing it just like we have in the past. We're going to have all of our Group Presidents : Greg Adelson, our GM of Payments; and our National Sales Manager, will all do presentations as well Dave and I and Mark Forbis, our CTO. There'll be open Q&A. And then in the evening, there will be a mini tech fair, where I believe we have six of our hotter products will all be shown there. So, we still got some open slots. If you want go, you can either email myself or Vance Sherard. So to wrap up, we're pleased with the results from our ongoing operations and the efforts of all of our associates to take care of our customers. I thank our associates for their hard work. Our executives, managers, and all our associates continue to focus on what is best for our customers and shareholders. I want to thank you again for joining us today. And Lydia (31:40), will you please now provide the replay number? Operator : Yes, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for participating in today's conference.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Jack Henry & Associates fourth quarter fiscal year 2018 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. It is now my pleasure to hand the conference to Kevin Williams, CFO of Jack Henry. Please go ahead. Kevin Williams : Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Jack Henry Associates fourth quarter and year-end fiscal 2018 earnings call. I am Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer; and on the call with me today is David Foss, our President and CEO. The agenda for this morning will be opening comments by me, and then I will turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the state of the business and the performance for the quarter. And then, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market closed, provide some guidance for FY 2019 and then we'll open the lines up for Q&A. I need to remind you that remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties. And the company undertakes no obligations to update or revise these statements For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Kevin. And good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another quarter with record revenue and earnings. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work that went into producing those results for our fourth fiscal quarter and the entire fiscal year. Total revenue increased 9% for the quarter and increased 7% excluding the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters. Organic revenue growth was 7% for the quarter. For the year, revenue increased 7%. We again had a very solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 12% for the quarter and increased by 10% if you exclude the impact of deconversion from both quarters. Our payments segment performed well, posting an 11% increase in revenue this quarter and a 12% increase excluding the impact of deconversion fees. Of course, Ensenta is a contributor to this growth; but even if we exclude Ensenta, we saw more than a 5% increase in revenue through our traditional offerings. We also had a very strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, posting a 7% increase in revenue this quarter and a 5% increase excluding the impact of deconversion fees. As I mentioned in the press release, our sales teams had an extremely strong quarter and finished both the quarter and the fiscal year well ahead of quota. In June, we broke our all-time monthly sales record with bookings of approximately 150% of the previous record for a single month. Most significantly from my perspective is the fact that the sales success for the quarter didn't come in any one particular product area. As I said in the press release, we booked 20 competitive core takeaways, but we also saw increased bookings in our payments and complementary solutions segments. Several of our newer solutions including Banno, debit processing, the new credit processing solution and treasury management saw strong demand. We also booked 24 in-to-out deals between our banking and Symitar groups. I could not be more pleased with the performance of the sales teams for this quarter and for the entire fiscal year. Regarding our new debit and credit processing solution, we now have 111 customers live on the new debit platform, including seven customers installed as new rather than as a migration. Our first full service credit client will go live later this month. As we've discussed previously, we're now in a position to start ramping our conversion volume for our existing debit clients and we're confident in our ability to maintain the quality of these migrations and new installations going forward. We also have more than a dozen new credit clients in the install queue, which present a new revenue stream for our company. On previous calls, we provided some high-level insights into our long-term plans regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As you will recall, shortly after the new tax program went into effect, we announced a significant increase in our quarterly dividend. We also announced a voluntary incentive plan which provided a large subset of our longer tenured employees the option to leave the company with a significant financial reward. We projected that Q4 expense of around $8 million as a result of this program, but as we discussed last time, our voluntary turnover rate runs well below the industry average and we saw the same trend reflected in the results of the special incentive program. Although we felt we had forecasted conservatively, many fewer people took advantage of the program than we had expected and the Q4 severance charge ended being a little more than $3 million. In addition to the dividend increase and the voluntary incentive program, we've chosen to use some of the TCJA tax savings to implement several long-term programs for the benefit of our employees. Last week, we announced an improved 401(k) offering and several components to a significantly enhanced bonus program, which are intended to provide a positive impact all JHA employees. These bonus programs are pay-for-performance plans, consistent with our corporate culture and all of these changes are designed to help us continue to attract and retain strong talent and ensure that Jack Henry continues to be recognized so broadly as the best place to work. The financial impact of these programs are included in the guidance Kevin will provide on this call. Overall, this was a very good year for our company. Our employee engagement and customer satisfaction scores remain very high. Our sales teams are performing extremely well and have positioned us for another successful year of selling, and overall demand for Jack Henry technology solutions remains very high in all segments of our business. As we begin the new fiscal year, I continue to be very optimistic about our future. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Dave. To talk about the press release we sent out yesterday and our quarter and year-end numbers, the service and support line of our revenue, which includes license, hardware, implementation services, in-house maintenance, bundled services and outsourcing increased 8% compared to the prior-year quarter or 5% if you exclude the deconversion fees and revenue from acquisitions and divestitures from both quarters. Deconversion fees were up $5.1 million compared to a year ago. As we have discussed previously, we have no control over the timing of these deconversion fees or when we actually record the revenue. All the deconversion fees for the quarter were in this line of revenue. The processing line of revenue, which includes online bill pay, card processing, remittance and remote deposit capture, along with transaction digital fees was up 10% compared to prior quarter and was up 7% if you exclude revenue from acquisitions and divestitures from both quarters. So, true operations were nicely in both lines of revenue. Total revenue was up 9% as reported or 6% by excluding the deconversion fees and revenue from acquisition divestitures. Our reported consolidated operating margins were flat at 26% this quarter compared to last year. And by excluding the deconversions fees and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, total operating margins were flat at 24%. So, we continue to have very strong margins. For our segment's operating margins, all continue to be very solid. For our core, it is 55% this quarter compared to 56% a year ago. Payments was 52% compared to 53%. Again, as we've talked for the last year, there's some headwind on our margins for the payments for this transition to the new platform. Our complementary segment was very strong at 60% compared to 60% last year. Without deconversion, acquisition, divestitures, the margins remained almost in line with where they were with those included. Our effective tax rate was, obviously, impacted significantly by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, for both the quarter and the year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21% -- or for the year, I'm sorry, was 21%, which is lower than guided last quarter which is because we were able to utilize some additional permanent tax savings during the quarter that came out of the TCJA due to some excellent work by our internal tax department and I want to personally thank them for all their efforts during this year to get all the TCJA ramifications put into place. Our effective tax rate for the year as reported, 3.7%. But if you adjust out the $94.5 million created by the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in our second fiscal quarter, our effective tax rate for the year was 27.9%, which is right in line with what we guided in February after the new tax law was put in place. I believe we said we thought it was going to be about 28% blended rate for the year. And this compares to a 33% effective tax rate we had last year in FY 2017. Due to the impact of the TCJA, a decent measurement this year, which typically I don't say this, might be our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, or EBITDA, which is $544.9 million this fiscal year compared to $507.7 million last fiscal year or 7.5% increase. Our EBITDA margins remain consistent at 35%. For cash flow, included in the total amortization, which we disclosed in the press release in the cash flow review, is the amortization for intangibles from acquisitions, which increased to $18.0 million this fiscal year compared to $14.4 million last year, which was caused by the acquisitions we made during FY 2018. Our free cash flow, which is defined operating cash flow less capital expenditures, capitalized software and proceeds from sale of assets was $262.9 million year-to-date, which compares to $215.7 million last year or a 22% increase. As a compare point, if you back out the impacts of the TCJA and compare this year's net income with the same effective tax rate as last year at 33%, then our net income conversion to free cash flow was slightly over 100% this year. Year-to-date, we have deployed our capital by investing $149.9 million back into our company and developing products, which is up slightly from $148.2 million a year ago as we continue to develop new products to roll out for our customers. We also returned $154 million to shareholders during the year through stock buybacks and dividends. Our return on equity for the trailing 12 months was 33% or 23% excluding the impact of TCJA. So, now let's discuss FY 2019 guidance. First, based on the sales that we experienced in Q4 FY 2018 and the sales pipeline that Dave referred to, we're very comfortable that total revenue growth will continue in the high mid-single digits in FY 2019, very similar to FY 2018. However, as Dave mentioned in his opening comments, as we have stated in the previous two earnings calls, we have now rolled out the additional employee related incentive plans. Do they have a cost? Yes. Do they have a long-term benefit? Absolutely yes. The cost is equal to approximately a fourth of the benefit we're experiencing from the TCJA, which allows us to enhance our pay for performance plans for our associates. The benefit is it allows us to put a pay for performance plan in place for all associates with essentially the same corporate target for all associates that Dave and I are focused on. Therefore, all 6,400-plus associates either benefit from our core performance if we hit our targets and none of us benefit if we miss. This puts all of our associates in line with our shareholders. The actual projected cost of these additional incentive plans, combined with the increased cost in FY 2019 from our transition to the new payments platform that we've been talking about for well over a year, we'll create a headwind on our operating margins. We anticipate our operating margins to decrease by 60 to 80 bps for FY 2019 compared to FY 2018 due to this additional expense pressure. Therefore, even though our revenue is going to continue growing in the high mid-single digits, our operating income will most likely grow in the range of mid-lower single-digits. But as I stated, we are utilizing some of the TCJA savings. So, the offset to this is our projected lower effective tax rate of 23% to 24% in FY 2019 compared to 27.9% rate in FY 2018, which is adjusted for the remeasurement for the deferred taxes on our balance sheet and compares to the 33% in FY 2017. The combined financial bottom line impact of our revenue growth with these two elements, the additional cost of incentive plans and a platform payment and the impacts from TCJA on our consolidated EPS is projected to be approximately a 10% to 11% increase in EPS in FY 2019 compared to FY 2018. Just for comparison, if you back out the impacts of the remeasurement of our deferred taxes in FY 2018, our adjusted EPS would've been approximately $3.63 for FY 2018, which is up nicely from the $3.14 EPS in FY 2017 or 16% adjusted increase. So, for FY 2019, we're currently projecting our EPS to be in the range of $3.94 to $4.04 or 9% to 11% increase in EPS compared to FY 2018. Also, as a reminder, our historical trend is to start up here, in the first quarter, a little weak and then our operations and related earnings continue to improve quarterly throughout the year. As far as 606, I know we're all looking for that. We will be providing a looking a full retro restatement of the two previous years for ASC 606, which became effective for us on July 1, 2018. Like others in our industry, we will be filing an 8-K with the restated previous two years under ASC 606 with comparisons to historical number under ASC 605 and included FY 2018 by quarter under 606 in the filing that we will be submitting before the end of September. Converting our thousands of contracts to ASC 606 to obtain an opening balance sheet as of the two years ago has been a huge effort for our accounting team and I want to thank them for all of their continued hard work. With that, that concludes our opening comments. We're now ready to take questions. Haley, will you please open the call lines for questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Good to see the 20 core competitive core takeaways. Could you breakdown for us where those takeaways come from, let's say, between credit union, community bank and then your kind of mid to up market bank segment? David Foss : Sure. So, well, 12 in the credit union side, 8 on the banking side make up the 20. As far as \u2013 I don't have for the quarter. I have for the year as far as the mid-market segment. So, for the year, we had 4 on the banking side and 1 on the credit union side as far as over $1 billion in assets. David Togut : Got it. And then, could you give us your view of bank and credit union tech spending priorities for the year ahead? What are the biggest areas of spending that line up with your kind of top products? And you expect the strength that we've seen year-to-date to continue into 2019? David Foss : So, I'll take the second part of your question first. So, the demand environment right now continues to be strong. The best indicator for me was when we had that record June that I referenced earlier, 150% of the next highest quarter we've ever had in the history of the company. So, you would expect, at the end of June, that your pipeline would drop off significantly after a performance like that. It dropped off just a little bit. And by the end of July, we were back to a pipeline that was greater than before we started June. So, that indicates to me the demand environment continues to be very strong. I'm very optimistic as far as spending in the space. As far as products, digital continues to be top of mind for pretty much any bank or credit union that we talk to. They're trying to figure out what their strategy, implement the strategy going forward for a best-of-breed online and mobile experience for their clients. That's much broader than just traditional online or mobile banking. And payments is a hot topic for a lot of our customers. I think as evidenced by the success that we're having with our new payments platform. And then just kind of the general topic of serving commercial customers, so whether it's on the lending side, the online commercial lending, for example, or if it's helping them manage their environment through tools like treasury management, banks, in particular, but a lot of credit unions too are really focused on trying to deliver solutions that will serve their commercial customers in a much an enhanced fashion over what they've had previously. David Togut : Understood. Thanks for that. Just a quick final question. The SGA expense was up about 13% year-over-year. I think, Kevin, you called out some ASC 606 expense in there, but how should we think about SG&A spending growth for FY 2019? Kevin Williams : Well, I would tell you, David, that we had to ramp up an enormous amount of internal resources to get 606 in line. We had to go back and basically recast literally thousands and thousands of contracts. And then, also, we had to engage external accounting firms who wanted help us with those contracts. Recasted also our independent external auditor to actually audit those numbers. So, there's a big ramp up in salaries, but also professional services in there, which the professional services, a big chunk of that will go away next year once we get 606 recast. David Togut : So, so SG&A expense grow more in line with revenue in FY 2019? Kevin Williams : Actually, it should be at a slight discomfort to revenue growth. David Togut : Got it. Thank you so much. David Foss : You bet. Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Huff of Stephens. Your line is now open. Brett Huff : Good morning, guys. Hope you are well. David Foss : Good morning, Brett. Brett Huff : You went through the numbers a little bit quickly for me on some of the growth in the various segments kind of stripped out of some of the deconversion fees and the M&A. In particular, Kevin, the first part of your stuff that you went through, could you just give me those numbers again on a growth rate kind of X items, if you will? Kevin Williams : Sure. So, our margins \u2013 you're talking about margins or growth? Brett Huff : Growth. I'm sorry. Kevin Williams : Well, I didn't give the growth for the segments, Brett. Brett Huff : Then maybe it was Dave. I'm sorry. David Foss : Yeah. So, revenue growth for \u2013 you had the overall numbers. So, on the core segment, revenue growth, 12% for the quarter, 10% if you exclude deconversion fees; payment segment was 11% for the quarter, 12% if you exclude deconversion fees. But then, I also commented that Ensenta is in there. So, we were a little over 5% if you exclude the contribution from Ensenta. And then, complementary solutions, 7% increase in revenue and 5% excluding deconversion fees. Brett Huff : Awesome. Thank you. Okay. And then, just trying to make sure I understand the impact of the less-than-expected expense from the buyout. I think you said you guided $8 million, it came in at $3 million. So that $5 million \u2013 you've got a $5 million reprieve on expense. And just doing that math, is that about a $0.05 benefit if I just kind of run it down to the bottom line, Kevin? Kevin Williams : Roughly $1 million is payment EPS. Brett Huff : Okay. That was the other one. And then, the last one, a little bit more on the success of the debit and credit processing system, can you just give us an update, telling us kind of what you had said before and if anything has changed in terms of when the expense from both spending on the new products as well as the expense potentially going away as we shut down the old two debit switches, can you just remind us of what you've said on that and then if anything has changed based on kind of new at least success to-date? David Foss : Sure. In the past, we've said somewhere between the end of calendar 2019 and the end of fiscal 2020. So, between December 31 of 2019 and June 30 of 2020. Somewhere in there is where we expect to wrap up. It's still early days. We're up to 111 customers on the new platform. Very comfortable that it will be in that timeframe. I wish I could get a little more specific, but we're still early days in that. But I think that timeframe, we're very comfortable with. Kevin Williams : Yeah. Remember, Brett, we still have close to 900 customers to migrate over off two platforms. And just a reminder, the reason we're being so careful with this is because we want to have zero impact on the end-users because we don't want to have to reissue cards, we don't have to change PINs. So, once the migration is over, the customer is going to have the same experience after the migration as they did beforehand. So, that's one of the reasons we're being slow and conscious on this and being very careful on what groups of customers we migrate at the same time. David Foss : That's a key point. There is zero impact to the consumer. So, no better scenario for the bank or credit union if they have zero impact on their consumer as they go through a major card conversion. Brett Huff : That's helpful. And last question for me, also on the processing \u2013 or the credit and debit card investment, Kevin, I think you said 60 basis points, 80 basis points negative impact from both that and the benefits that you guys are rolling through. Are you willing to parse that out into those two buckets separately? Kevin Williams : I can. It will be roughly a 60/40 split, with 60 towards the incentives. Brett Huff : Okay. That's what I needed. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Kevin Williams : Yeah, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Hey, good morning, Kevin and Dave. How are you? David Foss : Good. Kartik Mehta : Kevin, as you look at the backlog \u2013 I know, Dave, you said that you had a very good sales year. And as you look at the backlog, what percentage of revenue do you think that that backlog encompasses for FY 2019. So, what I'm trying to get to is, how much more do you have to do in sales to meet your guidance or revenue target? Kevin Williams : Well, Kartik, so let me just say a couple of things. One, roughly 80% of our revenue is recurring. So, that's already there. The additional sales and backlog, which if you think about, most of our sales today are not going to have much, if any, impact in the next fiscal year because we've got close to a 12-month backlog of installs on most of our products. And most of those are either outsourced or payments in nature, so as we might convert those, it's not going to be a huge increase in revenue because it's not like the old days when we had great, big license sales. So, basically, if you look at our backlog and our recurring revenue, we've pretty much got next year's guidance already in the bank. Kartik Mehta : Okay. And then, Dave, I know \u2013 and we've talked about the new credit and debit platform. One of the reasons you went with the credit platform was you were seeing some demand from your customers to offer credit cards, especially on the community bank side and credit union. Is that still true? And are you still seeing that demand? Or has anything changed? David Foss : No, that's absolutely true. It's the reason why I highlighted in my opening comments the fact that we already have 12 in the hopper or more than 12 in the hopper for install. We haven't done a single credit install yet, and yet the demand is there. So, people have been signing contracts without us being able to point to a customer and say, here this customer is live, call him and ask him how great it is. So, that is definitely demand. We're seeing exactly what we saw before we started this project, is out there. And interestingly to me, more demand for debit from new customers. So, I highlighted we already have seven new customers that weren't previously on our debit platform. And a lot of interest among new customers that wanted to come to this platform who weren't previously with us. So, the demand is out there. It's our job delivered. Kevin Williams : There is a very strong pipeline in our sales pipeline of potential candidates out there, Kartik. Kartik Mehta : And then, just \u2013 Kevin, as you look at the FY 2019 guidance, I know you've said this is very difficult, but in terms of deconversion fees, what do you assume? Do you assume they will be flat or do you assume they will be down for FY 2019? Kevin Williams : Kartik, I'm assuming that they are going to be down slightly. But, again, it's very unpredictable. We thought they were going to be down this year, and they were down pretty much the first half of the year. And then, the fourth quarter, basically 90% of the increase for the year was in the fourth quarter. So, it's very hard to judge. So, that's why we break all that out in the earnings release. You can actually see true operations. But I'm actually assuming deconversion fees down slightly. Kartik Mehta : Perfect. Thank you. I really appreciate it. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Kartik. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Heckmann of Davidson. Your line is open. Peter Heckmann : Hey, good morning, everyone. Just two follow-up questions on the new Banno that you've been talking about. Is that the unified mobile Internet? Is that out in GA? And if so, how many banks would you have live on the new platform? David Foss : Yeah. It is out in GA complete. And the Banno story is a single platform for what we used to call online banking, what we used to call mobile banking, but also for the website, for the financial institution and a responsive advertising and some other tools thrown in to interact with the consumer, all off a single platform. So, it's a really nice full function digital platform. As far as customers running the complete suite, I don't have an exact number for you, Pete. I know that it's less than a dozen. It's probably 5 or 6 or something like that. Peter Heckmann : Okay. How does the backlog look in that regard? David Foss : We sold a lot this year. So, in the quarter alone, we booked 23 new customers in the quarter. So, backlog is strong. Demand is strong. A lot of customers. And I think this should be obvious. There were waiting to see until we got the complete platform rolled out, wait and see if it was really all that before they would commit to the platform. So, lot of interest, lot of interest, lot of demand. And the good news about that platform is that it's something that we \u2013 today, we're not marketing it outside Jack Henry core base, but we can. We already have a number of non-Jack Henry core customers live on the mobile side. Just mobile. And we will be marketing the complete platform outside the Jack Henry base. But, right now, we have so much demand inside the Jack Henry base, we're focused there, but the platform is ready to go outside the core base. So, it becomes a ProfitStars solution available to virtually any bank or credit union. Kevin Williams : Yeah. Pete, so next week is our Symitar education conference in San Diego. Obviously, the Banno will be a highlighted product at that, which typically drives some additional sales. And we've got record attendance signed up to be there again this year. So, both \u2013 I'm not sure if we have a record number of prospects, but I know we have a record number of current customers that are going to be there next week. Peter Heckmann : Got it, got it. That's helpful. And then, forgive me if I missed it, but in terms of the forecast for CapEx and capitalized software for fiscal 2019? Kevin Williams : Cap software should be down slightly. The CapEx is probably going to be up a little bit, Pete. So, I think, all in all, in total, it's probably going to be pretty level with this year. Peter Heckmann : Got it. That's helpful. And then, just last question before I get back into queue, on 606, did not have an effect on term fees where instead of the period where you would normally recognize it, you may spread it over several periods? Did I hear that was one part of the new rule? David Foss : Yeah. It changes a little bit, Pete. So, under 605, when you had term fees, whenever they deconverted and you got the check, that's when you recognize the revenue. Under 606, whenever they gave you the notification that they are going to deconvert, then you have to spread that deconversion fee from that date to the date they actually deconvert. And if that deconversion date moves, then you have to readjust your estimate and spread. But I don't think it's going to have a big impact because, typically, those deconversion fees are six months or less from when we actually get notified anyway. So, it may spread it over a couple of periods. But at the end of the day, I don't think it's going to have much impact from what we've had in the past. Peter Heckmann : Okay, that's helpful. Appreciate it. David Foss : Yes. Thanks, Pete. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Willi of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Timothy Willi : Hi. Thanks and good morning, Kevin and Dave. A couple of questions. First on the consumer side. Relative to the credit and debit transition you're doing, if you've said this before at Analyst Day, I apologize for forgetting, but could you just talk a bit about how your banks think about credit cards going forward? Any sort of just color you could add around their penetration or their plans as they now have these expanded capabilities to start to organically grow their business which, obviously, continues to accrue to you as well over time? Anything you could give there? David Foss : Sure. Well, the biggest motivator, I guess, I would say, or the biggest opportunity is a lot of banks today don't manage their own card portfolio on the credit card side. They've sold those off years ago or had just kind of walked away from that space. And so, it's a new opportunity not only for us, but many of our clients who weren't offering their own credit cards, weren't managing their own card base. So, that's where the biggest opportunity is for us. Certainly, there are some who already have their cards in place and they are going to bring that card base to Jack Henry. For those customers, the big motivators are, number one, real-time fraud \u2013 this best-of-breed real-time fraud platform for them to help ensure the security of their consumers. Number two, rewards programs that are included in the platform as a single platform. So, not a separate, standalone component for them to manage. So, that offers opportunities for them to attract new consumers because they have this rich reward program that they can \u2013 that they can work with. And then, number three, there's lots of functionality in the new platform around reporting. And that can take many flavors. It can be around feeding the marketing organization within the bank or credit union, to target customers with additional products based on spending practices, that kind of thing. So, lots of opportunities for those who take advantage of all the tools that are in the new platform. Timothy Willi : Is it safe to assume that these banks are ramping up and preparing to actually launch these businesses as this happens? I guess there's always the risk that there's a lot of fanfare and they try, but there's not a lot of success on their end, but the converse is \u2013 do you sense that they're very much getting ready to launch these businesses and really make it a core part of their operation on the retail side as opposed to just something they can do, but don't really lean into? David Foss : Yeah. It's a good question. And your point is well taken. There are some institutions that are really good on the marketing side and others that aren't. And so, I don't know that I can paint that picture with a broad brush. It depends on the individual institution. But in general, they see this as an opportunity for them to, A, provide a better service to their customers; B, provide a revenue-generating \u2013 non-interest revenue-generating income for the financial institution and to grab customer loyalty. So, when you put those people on the table, most banks and credit unions are pretty focused on that. But like I say, there's no broad brush to paint every financial institution with. some of them are really good. And some of them struggle in that area. Kevin Williams : And it doesn't even depend on size. David Foss : No, that's right. Yeah, it's not size dependent. Timothy Willi : Got you. And then, switching over to the corporate side, you guys have talked for a while around the small business banking tools, treasury management type stuff, corporate payments. In general \u2013 and it sounds like the pipeline is \u2013 and interest levels continue to escalate there. Is that lumpy revenue? Or is that something that gradually also works its way into the income statement just based upon implementation schedules or sort of how banks turn around and begin to sell that to their small business customers? David Foss : Yeah. There aren't any of those solutions we've talked about. And I always hesitate when I say the word any because they are not absolutes, but there aren't any that we've talked about that are licensed software. Every one of those that we've been discussing is a hosted solution, which implies a recurring revenue model, whether it's treasury management or our commercial lending center suite, all those things that are geared toward the commercial customer relationship that we've been talking, our recurring revenue models. Timothy Willi : Okay, perfect. That's all I had. Thanks very much. David Foss : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Glenn Greene : Thanks. Good morning. David, could you just give a little bit more color on the sales environment and activity. Obviously, you had a really good quarter with the 20 core wins and sounds like a gangbuster June. Is it more environment, sales execution? You guys have been doing this for a long time. It sounds like there's clearly an acceleration, just a little bit more context than what you're actually seeing in an environment and from your clients? David Foss : Yeah, it's a good question. I think it's a combination of both of those that you mention. The environment is strong, and I've said for the last three, four calls, I think. As far as I'm concerned, it's now 18 months ago where the spending environment started to improve where we started to see more interest in banks and credit unions' spending on technology. So, the environment is strong. It's remaining very strong. So, that's, obviously, a help. But we've made \u2013 and we highlighted at the analyst call, the analyst meeting here earlier this year, we made some structural changes in the sales organization, and much of that was around encouraging cooperation between the sales teams and having \u2013 ensuring that sales reps are focused on and, frankly, compensated for helping their brethren out when it comes to a sales opportunity and looking for those opportunities to help each other be successful. And so, I think a little bit of a change in the way that we go to market, but also the environment that we're in today, the spending environment, those combined, I think, are what has driven the recent success. I've said it on the call many times before, if you can book 10 new competitive core takeaways in a quarter, that's a really good quarter. So, to do 20 in the quarter, I was really proud of the teams and very happy with how things are going right now. Kevin Williams : Yeah. On the restructuring, Glenn, it's amazing how many ProfitStars sales trail a new core win. And now, because of the relationships and the cooperation between the teams, we're starting to see some very nice core leads coming out of the ProfitStars organization. Glenn Greene : So, Kevin, just the segue, so the guide \u2013 the revenue guide you talked about, I think you said high mid-single-digit range, which is pretty comparable to what it's been, in the context of what you're seeing in the sales environment \u2013 and I do have a question on the 606 impact of that \u2013 but are you being conservative here or why won't the growth accelerate? Kevin Williams : Well, it could accelerate, Glenn. And, obviously, we've always been conservative. That's kind of where we think it's going. And again, even though we had a very strong sales in Q4, a lot of those sales are not going to contribute revenue to us until Q4 of this fiscal year because of the install backlog. And just because of those dates, some of those banks want to convert because of their current contracts, obligations that they are in. David Foss : And when Kevin says the install backlog, that's not to imply that we don't have enough staff to deliver product. That's about the logical transition for the bank or credit union to the new solution. They need a lot of time to plan some of these big projects. Glenn Greene : Does 606 have any impact, positive or negative, to your growth rates, Kevin? Kevin Williams : It should not have an overall impact to our growth rates. It's going to make it a little lumpier because of the way we're going to recognize revenue. Obviously, when we recast the revenue, I think the revenue in both 2017 and 2018 will actually go down a little bit, but so will 2019. But I think the growth rate on a comparative basis will be pretty much in line with the guidance I gave. Glenn Greene : And then, just my final question, once you get past the debit and credit conversion to the new platform, kind of mid-2020, what kind of margin lift are you expecting? Kevin Williams : That's a good question, Glenn, and I'm not really ready to answer that right now because we're still adding staff and adding costs. I think the additional cost this year. And again, part of that also is how fast we add new customers to the platform, which helps to offset that margin between now and when we actually get to shut the systems down. So, we've got 90-plus developers that will either find a new home within the organization or go somewhere else that will be gone, plus we'll be able to shutdown four mainframes. So, it'll be a nice lift when we get to finally shut them down. But, again, a little over 20% of our total revenue. So, the impact on the margins on that 20% of revenue is going to be very nice. The overall margin on the entire company will be some, but it's not 200 basis points. Glenn Greene : Okay. Thanks, guys. Kevin Williams : Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. Joseph Foresi : Hi. My first question is, in FY 2019, are you expecting any benefit from the software retirement and, I guess, if you could quantify that? And then, as we look at FY 2020, is that the year that we should expect the benefit? Kevin Williams : Software retirement on the payments platform, is what you mean? Or which software? Joseph Foresi : Yes, that's right. On the payments platform? Kevin Williams : So, that will all happen in FY 2020 when we are able to shut down both platforms. Joseph Foresi : Okay. And then on the revenue growth side, I know you've talked about this year and how you really don't see the benefit from a pipeline until 4Q. But based on what you're seeing now, do you think that there's a bias towards the upside on revenue growth over the long term as those \u2013 as this pipeline starts to convert? Kevin Williams : Yeah, Joe. Obviously, with the strong Q4 that we had, not only new sales, but also, as Dave mentioned, the 24 in-to-out migrations which drives additional revenue, which those will be sprinkled out throughout the FY 2019, which all that will help to drive revenue growth into FY 2020. Joseph Foresi : Okay. And then lastly, just on the outsourcing front, we haven't talked a little bit about it. Maybe you can give us an update on outsourcing, how much it grew? And how you're seeing the conversion among your clients? Thanks. David Foss : Sure. So, I highlighted in my opening comments that we booked 24, what we call, in-to-outs. So, those are in-house customers that are moving to outsourcing. So, that was in the quarter. And I also highlighted in the press release that of the new core signings that we had, almost all of them signed up as outsource customers. So, we continue to see that trend toward outsourcing in general. I don't know if you want to add any specific metrics around the numbers. Kevin Williams : Well, the other thing I'd add, Joe, is if you just look at our outsourcing services which is, obviously, all of our data centers in cloud services, they grew consistently in Q4. Just like for the year, Q4, they grew about 11% for the year. Our outsourcing and cloud service group, 10%. So, that continues to be the very large driver of our overall revenue growth. Joseph Foresi : Got it. I'm going to sneak one more in. On Ensenta, maybe you can give us some updates on the integration there, how it's working with your clients and how you're layering it into deals? Thanks. David Foss : Yeah. That's a good point. Frankly, I'm glad you asked because of the 24 acquisitions that I've been involved in in the past 18 years or so, I would have to say this has been the smoothest integration as far as systems, employees, financials, HR, everything, technology, really finished in, I think, May or June of this year. The team has just fit perfectly into the Jack Henry environment. There was a really nice cultural match from a product standpoint. They fit perfectly because they were so focused on the credit union space. And our traditional solutions in that area were not focused in the credit union space. They were primarily sold to banks. And so, they are very complementary to what we're doing. So, we're seeing nice demand for that solution. And I couldn't be happier with the way that whole acquisition has gone. Joseph Foresi : Great, thank you. David Foss : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is now open. David Koning : Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks. So, first of all, just making sure on guidance, you kind of said this to Glenn's question, but 606 accounting, the way you're guiding fiscal 2019, is it almost like it doesn't matter whether it's on the current basis or post 606, like either way revenue is going to be pretty close to same, maybe slightly lower, but the point is that $3.94 to $4.04 number regardless would be that number? Kevin Williams : Right. David Koning : Okay. Okay. In the order of magnitude on revenue, down like maybe a percent lower than it would have been \u2013 like it's not big, right? Kevin Williams : No, it's not huge at all. David Koning : Okay, okay. Secondly, you made a comment about fiscal Q1 following kind of the pattern of being \u2013 but that's usually a little lighter quarter on EPS. Were you basically saying that \u2013 consensus, I think, is $0.95. Were you kind of saying to try to be a little below that? Was that kind of what you were saying? Kevin Williams : Dave, always because Q4 is so strong and we've got so much going on in Q1 with our year-end sales meetings and kickoffs and our Symitar education conference, different things that typically, just on average, Q1 is a little weaker and then we kind of grow throughout the year. So, just being a little conservative in causes. David Koning : Okay. But is there any number that you kind of want us to go towards? David Foss : No, none. None that I'd really guide to. David Koning : All right. All right. And the last question, so you called out in the press release, and I think you've kind of mentioned this before that, the deferred revenue drawdown is benefiting revenue a little bit. But, eventually, that deferred revenue runs out. But is outsourcing kind of the offset that since that's growing that even as deferred revenue gets drawdown, the outsourcing growth kind of offsets. Is that the way to think about that? Kevin Williams : Yeah, that's one of the ways, Dave. But, remember, so when we go through the 606 recast, and like I said, what we said, filing an 8-K before the end of December to give you all the actual restated numbers for FY 2018 quarter and the prior two years. But as 606 goes into effect, bundling essentially goes way, which means that, now under 606, we can recognize revenue from every delivered product as part of a contract because it all busts apart, where under 605, we couldn't recognize any revenue under a contract until the last part was delivered, which caused some lumpiness. So, we could have delivered $2 million worth of products a year ago, but until we deliver that last product that may only be $25,000, we couldn't recognize any of that $2 million of revenue. But as soon as we deliver that last tool or product, then we recognize that revenue over that quarter of the year. So, we have to go back and unwind all of this that we've done for the last ten years and to come up with an opening balance sheet from two years ago and then recognize the revenue from the software and the implementation services upon delivery of each individual product rather than the last product of a contract. So, it's going to bust all the bundling up. It's going to move some parts around. It's going to take \u2013 probably take revenue down a little bit, but it's just going to kind of take that one pocket and put in the other and it should not have a significant impact on total revenue or total revenue growth. David Koning : Great. Okay, thank you, guys. Good job. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Dave. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back to Kevin Williams, CFO, for any closing remarks. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Haley. First of all, I'd like to echo what Dave said, and I want to honestly thank all of our associates for what they've done in FY 2018. They've done a great job. We've done a great job taking care of our customers and we will continue to take care of our customers. And we are very pleased with the results of our ongoing operations and the efforts of all our associates to take care of our customers. Our executive, managers and all our associates will continue to focus on what is best for customers and what is best for our shareholders. With that, I want to thank you again for joining us today. And, Haley, will you please provide the replay number for the playback. Operator : Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, the replay number is going to be 800-585-5367 and 855-859-2056. There is also another number, 404-537-3406. The replay will be available starting today at 11 :45 AM Eastern Standard Time and will be available until August 31, 2018 at 11 :59 PM. Thank you for participating in the call today. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host Mr. Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Haley. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today for the Jack Henry & Associates first quarter FY 2019 earnings call. I\u2019m Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer, and on the call with me today is David Foss, our President and CEO. The agenda for this morning will be opening comments by me obviously, and then I will turn the call over to Dave he is going to provide some of his thoughts and the state of the business and the performance for the quarter. Then, I\u2019m going to provide some comments regarding the 8-K that we filed last week for the new revenue recognition accounting standard codification or ASC 606 that became effective for us July 1. And I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market close for our Q1 operating performance and then we will open up the lines for Q&A. I need to remind you that remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate, due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday\u2019s press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled risk factors and forward-looking statements. With that I will now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Kevin and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter with record revenue and earnings. As always I would like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work that went into producing those results for our first fiscal quarter. As you are aware, this is the first quarter for us to report our financials using the new revenue recognition rules prescribed by ASC 606. All of the quarterly comparisons we discuss today will be in relation to the restated quarters from the 8-K, we published last week. Kevin will provide much more detailed analysis regarding the impacts of 606 to our business, when he shares his opening remarks. For Q1 of fiscal 2019, total revenue increased 9% for the quarter and increased 10% excluding the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters. We again had a very solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 8% for the quarter and increased by 11%, if you exclude the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters. Our Payments segment performed well posting a 9% increase in revenue this quarter and a 10% increase excluding the impact of deconversion fees. We also had an extremely strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, posting a 13% increase in revenue this quarter and a 12% increase excluding the impact of deconversion fees. Our sales team again had a very solid sales quarter. We booked 12 competitive core takeaways, including two new multi-billion dollar banking clients. We also saw very strong bookings in our Payments and complementary solutions segments. Several of our newer solutions, including our Banno digital suite, debit processing, the new credit processing solution and treasury management saw strong demand. We also booked five in-to-out deals between banking and Symitar. Regarding our new debit and credit processing solution, we now have 166 customers live on the new debit platform, including 11 customers installed as new rather than as migration. We also have two new credit customers live on the platform. We have been focused on migrating more complex clients in the past couple of months to continue to prove the conversion model. So far, all of these migrations and new installations have been successful and our program continues to progress very well. We will suspend our migrations during the holidays because banks and credit unions don\u2019t like to implement changes to their card programs during this high volume time of the year. We expect to start migrating 40 to 50 customers per month in January and remain on track to complete the migration process sometime in the first half of calendar 2020. As you know, within the two weeks following the end of Q1, we announced two acquisitions Agiletics and BOLTS were both very small, but very strategic acquisitions for our company. Agiletics brings us a liquidity management solution and a deposit escrow sub-accounting system designed to allow our banks to serve larger commercial clients, who require escrow collection and disbursement tools. BOLTS provides digital account opening solution, which will be paired with our industry-leading Banno digital banking offering. Neither these acquisitions will impact our P&L in any material way, but both position us well as we compete for new and larger clients in the future. Since our last earnings call, we have completed our two largest client conferences of the year, our SEC conference for our Symitar core clients and our JEC conference for our Jack Henry Banking and ProfitStars clients. We had many prospects at each conference and our customers continue to be happy with our performance and extremely engaged with our prospective clients. Additionally, they continue to be optimistic about the coming year and their prospects for success. With that, I will turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Dave. First of all, I would like to provide some comments and color regarding the 8-K, as Dave mentioned, we filed last week for the full retro restatement of ASC 606 compared to ASC 605 and some of the larger impacts that impacted those recast numbers. The largest impact obviously is backing out the bundled revenue line of revenue. Remember under ASC 605, we were not allowed to take any revenue on a multi-owner contract until the last product included in the contract was delivered. And then 100% of the license implementation and the current year\u2019s in-house maintenance was recognized into revenue ratably over the remainder of the fiscal year, when the last product was installed, which did then grew throughout the year like a snowball effect as other contracts have the last product installed. This is why revenue dropped each quarter in the recast numbers in the 8-K and the revenue decrease essentially grew each quarter. Under ASC 606, we recognized the license imitation for each products separately even though they are part of a multi-owner contract which - this obviously spreads revenue for multi-owner contract products over quarters or potential even fiscal years. Another thing is deconversion fees under ASC 605 were recognized when the deconversion was complete and we received payment and it was received 100% all at one-time. But under ASC 606, these deconversion fees are spread from the date of the notification to the date of the actual deconversion, which does can cause some swings between quarters and fiscal years compared to the old way of doing it because we are comparing this and recognizing it all at one-time. We are required to recognize all of Banno software usage fees in the first quarter of the fiscal year or historically under 605 this was amortized over the fiscal year. This is part of the reason that revenue increased so much in this quarter last year in the recast numbers 8-K but then that is also why the Q2 revenue dropped off from Q1 sequentially, which you\u2019ll see the same thing happened this year is because of the software usage fees that are recognized 100% upfront and that is because the license has been installed. Also in future periods, there will be adjustments which fees will be based on estimates for our long-term outsourcing and processing contracts that could cause a carve out of the adjustment, which means percentage of adjustment would be allocated to license and implementation already delivered in previous quarters, which could cause an impact in any given quarter and this impact to actually positive or negative depending on the change in estimate. In the 8-K, as far as cost, the cost of revenue the biggest piece is backing out the cost directly related to the bundled revenue. This is offset somewhat by the increase in labor costs for the actual products that were delivered in that quarter and direct cost of product related to the products installed also during the quarter. The impact to the SG&A is primarily due to sales commissions and the related fringe benefits on those commissions having these spread out over a longer period of time under ASC 606 than we were doing under 605. That is a quick summary of the primary changes impacted our historical financial suggest and restate for ASC 606. Now I will provide some comments about the quarter and as Dave stated, all of the numbers in the release and that we are talking about are restated for ASC 606. The service and support line of our revenue increased 9% compared to the prior year quarter. Included in this line of revenue is the annual software usage fees, which we added quite a few customers on this offering last year and remember the difference is that under ASC 605, we amortized these fees over the fiscal year, but under ASC 606, a 100% of this revenue in the first quarter because the software has been delivered. And again this is the reason why the restate revenue in the 8-K we filed last week showed a decrease in total revenue in Q2 sequentially compared to Q1. And it was potentially drop off a little larger this year because of the added customers last year. Deconversion fees were down $2.9 million compared to year ago quarter. As we have discussed previously, we had no control over these and remember under 606 these now must be spread, with all the deconversion fees in the quarter were in this line of revenue. Processing line of revenue was 9% compared to the prior quarter and had no impact from deconversion fees. Our reported consolidated operating margins were down from 27% last year to 26% this year. As we discussed on the last call, there are two primary headwind impacts on operating margins. First is the double cost of processing our debit or customer\u2019s transaction that we have been talking for about 1.5 years until we get those customers migrate over to the new platform. And then, second the additional cost for the employee pay-for-performance plans that will be funded with a portion of the savings from the TCJA, that we talked about on our last earnings call. Our segment operating margin continue to be very solid, but small fluctuations and the segment information was actually in the press release that we put out yesterday. The effective tax rate was obviously impacted significantly by the TCJA for the quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 19% compared to 31% last year. Our effective rate for the quarter was lower than we guided last quarter, which is due to the increased excess tax benefits from share-based payments related to restricted stock that vested in September of this year, which those are based on total shareholder return compared to our peer group. For the balance of the year, our effective tax rate will increase and our projected total year effective tax rate is still expected to be slightly over 23%. For cash flow included in the total amortization, which is disclosed in press release in the cash flow review yesterday is the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions which increased to $5.1 million this year compared to $3.5 million last year. Free cash flow which is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, capitalized software and proceeds from sale of assets was $94.5 million, which represented about 113% of net income for the quarter. The significant increase in capital expenditures during the quarter, I believe it\u2019s $3 million last year and $24 million this year relates primarily to some data center upgrades that we discussed briefly on the last call, where I said that we did some year-end tax planning and acquired some assets and put in place for tax purchases at the end of the quarter to take advantage of the effect of the tax rate difference caused by TCJA, which gave us a multi-million dollar permanent tax savings. These assets were accrued for at June 30, but the actual cash was paid out in this quarter for those assets. Just a reminder, ASC 606 requires us to recognize revenue and related costs differently than we have done in the past. However it does not change our billing to customers, it doesn\u2019t change our collections, therefore 606 has no impact on our cash flows. Our cash flows will still flow the same as they had historically with higher cash flow operating free cash flows in Q1 and Q4 due to the collection of annual in-house maintenance billings and neutral to slightly positive in quarters Q2 and Q3. We invested $52.3 million back into our company through CapEx and developing products, which is up $30.1 million from a year ago, which almost all of this is due to the data center upgrades that we discussed. We did not buy any stock back during the quarter and there were no quarterly dividends in the first quarter because declared dividend in Q1 was actually paid on October 2, in Q2. For guidance for the rest of the year, we continue to [indiscernible] the revenue growth will continue to be in the high mid-single digits in FY 2019 similar to the restated FY 2018 compared to the restated FY 2017 in the 6% to 7% range. As I mentioned, we will continue to face headwinds on our operating margins for the year, so operating income growth will be down as percentage compared to revenue growth. We are still as Dave said, we are still on course, we done with our migration in the second half of FY 20, which is when the double cost will be eliminated and obviously, there would be a nice increase in margins at that time. And obviously, we will anniversary the new pay-for-performance plans going into FY 20. Also right now it appears the deconversion fees for Q2 and probably the year will be down similar to Q1. Now just a reminder for your models, as you update for ASC 606, you will need to adjust revenue down in Q2 as I mentioned, to allow for the decrease due to software usage fees, but revenue growth based on restated 606 should be in line with the full year guidance that I just provided. Also you will need to adjust the impacts of TCJA out of Q2 and for the entire fiscal \u201818 year for the impact of adjusting our deferred taxes and our balance sheet, which flows through the P&L in Q2 last year, which obviously had no cash flow impact. Then obviously with the 500 bps gain that we are predicting our effective tax rate this year to full year projected 23% from adjusted 28% effective tax rate last year, our EPS will still be up nicely for the year compared to last year. EPS will go down for ASC 606 for retro statement, but we will still have solid compared to restated net income. That concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions. Haley, will you please open the line up for questions? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Peter Heckmann of D.A. Davidson & Company. Your line is now open. Alexis Huseby : Hey, guys. This is actually Alexis on for Pete. So firstly thank you so much for providing the clarification on some of that ASC 606 impacts. I was wondering, if we could get a little more detail on the term fees maybe by quarter for 2018 under 606? Kevin Williams : For the - the deconversion fees? Alexis Huseby : Yes. Kevin Williams : I apologize I do not have those with me. Alexis Huseby : That is Alright. We can follow-up with that afterwards. So I think as just a little bit of a broader question. Do you think you could outline some of the customer\u2019s main priorities for the next year that you are seeing in terms of upgrading any technology for digital banking, online lending or security? David Foss : Sure. Alexis, this is Dave Foss. So you have pretty much get right there on some of the key priorities right now. Digital banking is on the top of mind for virtually any bank or credit union executive right now which is a key piece of what is fueling the demand for our Banno digital banking solution. And it\u2019s part of the reason why we did the BOLTS acquisition because digital having a complete digital suite is key. So we are getting lots of interest, lots of discussions currently on that topic. And I see that continuing through the year because if you look historically banks and credit unions would have an online banking solution and a mobile banking solution, and they were two different solutions. And the goal right now is eliminate that difference in user experience bringing them together, so it\u2019s a single user experience on a single digital platform that is a lot more fully function than anything that we had in the past. So that is clearly, top of the mind and then lending and really specifically around commercial lending. Part of the reason, why we have highlighted so much our Commercial Lending Center suite in the past year or so is part of the reason why we did the Vanguard acquisition last year was to really create a very robust commercial lending offering because that is what is fueling a lot of growth for our clients today. Certainly consumer lending is important, but commercial lending is where a lot of the focus right now. And then kind of tied to that is the topic of treasury management. So if you are going to serve large commercial customers with the commercial lending solution you also want to be able serve them overall with treasury management functionality which is why we develop can roll out the new treasury solution a year ago. So those are all absolutely top of mind, and then of course, we have been highlighting the card conversion process that we have been going through part of what is spot [indiscernible] that originally was there were so much demand customers who want to bring that credit card portfolios back into their bank of credit union and prior to this new platform that we rolled out. We didn\u2019t have a credit offering and so payments and having a robust payments platform is also a key driver for us. Kevin Williams : I can actually provide to the deconversion revenue now restated under 606. Okay. So for Q1 of FY 18, it was $10.7 million; for FY Q2, it was $9.7 million; for Q3, it was $18.4 million; and for Q4, it was $7.3 million for a total under 606 of $46.2 million. Alexis Huseby : Okay. Great. Thank you so much for that. And then maybe I will just sneak one more question, Kevin, guys thanks for the update on the debit and credit signing some customers and bringing live. I was wondering, if you could get something similar for Banno maybe just a number of banks that we have live right now and any contracted backlog? Kevin Williams : We have 281 live right now. I don\u2019t know that I have between mobile and online 281 customers live right now. I don\u2019t know that I have a backlog number, but it\u2019s continuing to grow. David Foss : I think if I\u2019m right, we contracted for 60 of them last year for the full suite. Kevin Williams : 62. David Foss : And Q1 that actually ramped up. It was over 20 in Q1. Kevin Williams : But I can\u2019t give an accurate number what the backlog will looks like right now. But as we are managing the backlog and it continues to be robust, we will put it that way. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. You saw a nice step-up in revenue growth ex-deconversion fees to 11% on the core and 10% on payments. And Kevin I recognize you are guiding to high-single digit for the year, but can you comment on the sustainability of this low-double digit organic revenue growth, which appears to be the highest we have seen in a while? Kevin Williams : Well, David. I will tell you the Q1 that I mentioned in my opening comments, we had a large number of software usage clients install last year, when that revenue was basis spread which caused the increase in Q1 in the 8-K and that caused an even bigger increase in Q1 this year because even though it\u2019s an annual software usage fee and they are using it for over the year because it\u2019s already been installed, effectively July 1, you recognize that revenue for the entire year again. So that caused Q1 to be grow a little faster. So we are not going to see that double-digit organic revenue growth for the rest of the year. It\u2019s going to go back down to the mid-single digits and for the full year. I still think it\u2019s going to be in the high mid-single digits. David Togut : I see, so that impacted both core and payments in the first quarter? Kevin Williams : Yes. David Togut : Got it. That is helpful. Thank you. And then, Dave you gave a lot of commentary on the June quarter call about bookings. I think to the effect that new contract signings for the month of June were 150% of the previous monthly record. Can you give some - maybe some more qualitative commentary or quantitative would be even better about bookings in the September quarter, numerical commentary? David Foss : I don\u2019t know that I have that number right in front of me. The sales team, as I said in my press release quote, so the sales team\u2019s exceeded their quota again this year. I don\u2019t have the exact number in front of me, but the most remarkable thing I think to what happened there was and you are absolutely correct in your summary of what I said about June, we were about 150% of the next largest month we have ever had in the history of the company. Logic would tell you when you have a month like that, your pipeline is going to drop off significantly and you are going to spend months rebuilding that pipeline because you just had huge bookings month and a huge bookings quarter. But in fact, we ended Q1, so just 90 days after that record, we ended Q1 with a pipeline that was actually and I did the math here this morning 16% higher than what the pipeline was going into the month of June. So we booked all this business took a whole bunch of sales out of the pipeline and yet within 90 days it was 16% higher than it was going into the month of June. So for me that - and having a pipeline does not represent closed deals obviously, you have to get them to close. But after having many years of experience, managing a pipeline and managing the sales team without any major change in the sales teams to see that type of growth in the pipeline was pretty significant as far as I\u2019m concerned and I think it sets us up well for the coming year. Again, you have to turn those pipeline deals into closed signed deals and there is no way to 100% predict what is going to happen there. But I think it really bodes well for the future, for the sales organization when we have had such a tremendous increase in the pipeline for the combined sales organization. David Togut : Understood. Thanks. That is helpful. Just a quick final question, if I could. You called out 12 core competitive takeaways in the quarter, are there any themes around those takeaways that we should be aware of, any specific competitors, any specific solutions within the core that are really gaining a lot of traction? David Foss : No. I would say it\u2019s consistent with what you have seen from us in the past. We tend to take competitive deals from all of our major competitors and from the solutions that they offer and we are continuing to see that. I think, we saw two multi-billion dollar banking deals in the quarter, which is significant. They don\u2019t come up for a core change all that often. They are not that many of them and so they don\u2019t make a core change that often. So they book two in a quarter is significant and we are working several other deals of that size. So I think maybe the only item of significance would be they tend to be several larger both banks and credit unions in the pipeline right now more than we have seen in the past and that is probably significant. But it\u2019s not any change in, who are taking these customers away from. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Glenn Greene : Alright. Thanks. Good morning, Dave and Kevin. Just wanted to follow-up on the booking and the sales commentary. Maybe Dave you could give us a little bit of color across the key brands you have, cross community banks, credit unions, complementary products, what was the tone of sales activity and then each of the three product areas exceed quota? Kevin Williams : Yes. It\u2019s consistent this quarter with what I highlighted last quarter. So if you recall last quarter, I talked about the fact that you would expect when you have a blowout quarter like that, that it would come in one particular area, but in the June quarter, it was actually spread across the sales group. So ProfitStars, Symitar and banking all three sales groups really had a very strong quarter. We saw the same thing in Q1 of fiscal 19, all three sales groups, but we didn\u2019t have a record breaking month like we did in June, but all three sales groups really performed well. There was - everyone of them exceeded quota. And so for banking and Symitar that tends to come when you are signing new core customers. And there is of course, follow-on business that comes with that core sales that can be significant, but it\u2019s all driven by core sales. And then for ProfitStars of course, there are no core sales in ProfitStars. ProfitStars is only sales non-core solution and so that spread across a wide variety of product lines. But I have highlighted a few of them already so digital and our lending suite and the Payments solution suite, we are seeing very good performance across all of those different product lines. So all three sales groups exceeded quota again in Q1 and are positioned well going forward. Glenn Greene : Alright. Great. That is helpful. And then Kevin, just can you help level set offs on the fiscal 2019 outlook given the restated basis for ASC 606. And I know you gave us the growth rates and gave some commentary on margins, but the EPS base level is reduced pretty meaningfully for 2018. And it looks to me at least on first glance consensus is something like 15% growth at this point, EPS growth based on fiscal 2019 consensus and maybe you could help level set us and if the 403 street number for fiscal \u201819 is reasonable? Kevin Williams : No. It\u2019s not Glenn because obviously, when we gave that guidance, we were still trying to get the product reused, recast and restated. So that was based on what I knew at that time. So you only know what you know. FY 2018 adjusted for 606 and adjusted for the tax rate, so if you back all the deferred tax nonsense, the true tax rate for FY 2018 was 28%, which means the EPS for FY 2018 was basically $3.27, so that is kind of level set from there. Glenn Greene : Okay. So basically take the revenue growth of the restated base had some margin degradation, the adjustment of the tax rate goes down at 23% or so for 2019? Kevin Williams : Yes. And now I get you real close to the ballpark, Glenn. Glenn Greene : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is now open. David Koning : Yes. Hey, guys. Thank you. I guess my first question. So I think we get the revenue base last year $1.47 billion that is what we grow the 6% to 7% off of. But one thing Q1 had some differences in the segments like complimentary was very strong some of the other ones were stronger than 6% to 7%, but not as strong as complementary. Is there anything that we should think about Q2, Q3, Q4 from a segment basis like the certain ones fluctuate more like this complimentary follow-up a lot more while payments and core kind of stay around that high-single digits. Just kind of walk through the second like how that is going to work? Kevin Williams : Well, Dave, again, so 606 is so much difference than 605 because 605 and we talked about this a lot over the last few years. So you could have an in-house core customer either bank or credit union that you install the last pieces of multi-account which could be [iTalk] (ph) in August or September. And all the software imitation first years maintenance might be $3.5 million. You don\u2019t recognize the $3.5 million now over the next three quarters. And then the start of July 1, you just backed in-house maintenance, where 606 a lot of that $3 million plus is going to be in the prior fiscal year because it ties directly to win the products you delivered. So, what this really going to advance some lumpiness. So for a like, when we do final installation of a multi-billion dollar apps as SilverLake, when we gave final install a 100% of revenue\u2019s going to hit in that quarter, almost a way use to back before the restatement back in 2015. Dave Koning : Okay. So your point is, it\u2019s going to decelerate during the year because of kind of the change, but there is going to be new lumpiness that is going to - that just - it\u2019s hard to predict how that each quarter is going to work? Kevin Williams : Correct, which is why I pointed out on the call, it\u2019s going to take a while, I think for you all and even us to get used to the slow of 606 because it is totally different than what we have done delivered in the past, but my point is, it has no impact on cash flow. Dave Koning : Yes. Right. Exactly. Okay. In Glenn\u2019s question, you went through some of the components, but is there another way to think of that - you guided before to something like a 394 to 404 was something like 10% to 12% off of your old EPS base. Is the new - do we take kind of the same growth rate but just apply it to the new EPS base? Kevin Williams : Yes. Dave Koning : Okay. Kevin Williams : That is the reason. Dave Koning : Okay. Good. Alright. Well, thanks guys. Appreciate it. David Foss : Thanks Dave. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Kevin Williams for any closing commentary. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Haley. Again, we are very pleased with the results for ongoing operations even though they are little confusing until everybody gets used to 606. We want to thank the efforts of all of our associates that take care of our customers. Our executives, managers and all of our associates will continue to focus on what is best for our customers and our shareholders. With that I want to thank you for joining us today. And Haley, will you please provide the replay number? Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. The replay number for your conference is going to be 800-585-8367 and 855-859-2056. And the local number is 404-537-3406. This conference will be available starting today at 11 :45 am. Eastern Standard Time and it will end on November 16, 2018. Thank you for listening in today\u2019s conference and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call will be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Kevin Williams. Please go ahead. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Chris. Good morning. Thank you all for joining us today for the Jack Henry & Associates second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. I\u2019m Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer, and on the call with me today is David Foss, our President and CEO. The agenda for this morning will be opening comments by me, and then I will turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts and the state of the business and our performance for the quarter. Then, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding press release that was put out yesterday after market closed and then we will open the lines up for Q&A.  I need to remind you that remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate, due to a number of risks and uncertainties and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday\u2019s press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. With that I am going to turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter with record revenue and earnings. As always, I would like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work that went into producing those results for our second fiscal quarter. Total revenue increased 8% for the quarter and increased 9% excluding the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters. Year-to-date, revenue is also up 8% and is up 9% year-to-date if you exclude the impact of deconversion fees. We had a very solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 5% for the quarter and increased by 6%, if you exclude the impact of deconversion fees from both quarters. Our Payments segment performed extremely well posting a 14% increase in revenue this quarter and a 13% increase excluding the impact of deconversion fees. We also had a strong quarter in our Complementary Solutions businesses, posting a 7% increase in revenue this quarter and a 9% increase excluding the impact of deconversion fees. On the topic of deconversion revenue, I am sure you\u2019ve noticed that in both Q1 and Q2, this line of revenue was down meaningfully year-over-year. We expect that trend to continue as we look forward to the second half of the year with Q3 significantly lower year-over-year and Q4 slightly lower. In many respects, this is a good problem to have because although we experienced a short-term revenue impact, it indicates that for fewer customers are deconverting and their long-term revenue contribution stays in place.  As we\u2019ve discussed many times in the past, deconversion revenue is largely outside our control and very difficult to forecast, but Kevin will provide more detail regarding what we see on the horizon in his remarks. Our sales team again had a very solid quarter in Q2. We booked 13 competitive core takeaways, and signed 19 customers to our new debit processing solution. None of those 19 customers had used Jack Henry for debit processing in the past.  We also saw very strong bookings in our Payments and Complementary Solutions segments. Several of our newer solutions, including our Banno digital suite, our commercial lending automation solution, and treasury management saw strong demand. We also booked 17 in-to-out deals between banking and Symitar. The sales organization ended the first half of the fiscal year at 109% of quota and they\u2019ve built a solid pipeline for the remainder of the year. The pipeline is up 26% over where we ended June 30 of 2018.  Regarding our new debit and credit processing solution, we now have 214 customers live on the debit platform, including 21 customers installed as new rather than as a migration. We also have three new credit customers live on the platform. So far, all of these migrations and new installations have been successful and our program continues to progress well. As we discussed on the last call, we suspended our migrations during the holidays, but we have already completed a group migration in January and remain on track to complete the migration process sometime in the first half of calendar 2020.  As most of you are aware, we branded our inventory-leading digital suite as Banno. The second quarter was significant for our Banno team because we brought 45 new clients live on one or more of the Banno modules including on the $35 billion banks that went live with the complete Banno solution. Today, we have 27 banks and credit unions running on the complete suite which includes Banno Online, Banno Mobile and Banno Conversations. We have an additional 155 financial institutions live on Banno Mobile only. We are seeing a 95% month-over-month return rate with the Banno applications, which indicates that once a consumer downloads the App, they are extremely likely to keep using it each month. This is a very high percentage for a consumer-facing application. Our Banno conversations module is receiving particularly high marks. So we are excited about the Banno suite as a true differentiator for our banks and credit unions as they serve their customers in highly competitive digital world. As we began the second half of our fiscal year, we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our customers, our ability to expand our customer relationships, the spending environment and our long-term prospects for success. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Dave. The service and support line of revenue increased 6% compared to the prior year restated quarter again all previous numbers have been restated for the new revenue recognition rules under ASC 606. We had a very strong quarter for license, in-house maintenance, software usage, software subscription and data processing and hosting revenue, all in this line of revenue. We do continue to have some headwinds from decreased implementation revenue due to the vast majority of our core installs are electing our outsourcing model with implementation revenue must be spread over a period of time according to the contract unlike under 605.  As Dave mentioned, our deconversion fees were down $3.1 million per compared to year ago quarter and as we have discussed previously, we had no control over these and all of our deconversion fees were in this line of revenue. The processing line of revenue grew 11% compared to the prior quarter and had no impact from deconversion fees. Total revenue was up 8% reported and low higher than 9% adjusting for the deconversion fees. Our reported consolidated operating margins were down from 24% compared to last year to 23% this quarter as we discussed previously, there are two headwind impacts from operating margins this year. First the additional cost of processing our debit card customers as that we transitioned more to the new payments platform and then the second is the additional cost for the employee pay-for-performance plan that are being funded with a portion of the savings from the Tax Cuts Job Act that we discussed on previous calls. Remember we have the benefit of the reduced Federal income tax this year compared to last year and our operating margins for the year remained flat at 25%. But as previously guided, there will be additional pressure on our margins because of these items as we continue to increase cost related to the migration of the payments platform in the second half of this year.  Our segments\u2019 operating margins continue to be very solid with small fluctuations with payments that we will see some increased margin headwind going forward, again as we increase these double costs as we migrate these customers over to the new platform.  Our effective tax rate was obviously impacted significantly by the TCJA for the quarter. The effective tax rate this year was 23%, compared to a negative 19% last year.  For the balance of the year, our effective tax rate will increase slightly each quarter and our projected total year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% by the time we wrap up this fiscal year.  For cash flow included in the total amortization, which we disclosed in the press release is cash flow \u2013 is the amortization intangibles from acquisitions which increased to $10.3 million year-to-date this fiscal year compared to $7.4 million last year.  Depreciation is down slightly for the quarter, but amortization is up primarily due to more of our internally developed products being put into production plus the acquisitions that we did in October that we announced previously and remember, when a product gets to our beta, we stop capitalizing according to the FASB rules and will begin amortizing at that time.  Our operating cash flow was $192 million for the first six months which represents an 8% increase over the last year. The significant increase in capital expenditures year-to-date was primarily due to the cash paid out in Q1 that we discussed on the last call.  Our cash flows will have the same seasonality as historical with significantly higher cash flows in Q1 and Q4 due to the collection of annual in-house maintenance billing. We did invest $89.7 million back in our company through CapEx and development of products which is up from $65.2 million a year ago, again with a vast majority of the increase due to the datacenter upgrades that we talked about in Q1. We did buy 150,000 shares of our stock from treasury during the quarter.  For guidance for the balance of the year, Dave and I already mentioned, our deconversion fees were down compared to last year both the first and second quarters, which is a good thing that means that we are not losing as many customers through M&A, but it does creates challenges in year-over-year comparisons which is why we backed them out to show non-GAAP true operations in the press release. It appears now that our deconversion fees in Q3 are going to be down significantly compared to last year. In fact, at this time it appears that they could be down by the much of $13 million in Q3 compared to last year.  Therefore, since each million dollars of deconversion fees essentially equates to approximately one penny of EPS, we need to bring the consensus EPS estimate down by approximately $0.13 for Q3 and the year due to the significant decrease in these fees.  For the year, we are projecting deconversion fees to be down roughly $20 million compared to last year at this time, which were down almost $6 million in the first half which means we are going to be down about $14 million in the second half.  However, with these headwinds, our GAAP revenue growth for the fiscal year should still wind up to be in the 5.5% to 6% range with operating income essentially flat due to both the decrease in deconversion fees and the additional cost headwinds from our payments platform migration and the new pay-for-performance plan that we\u2019ve previously talked about. On a non-GAAP basis, our revenue growth should still be in line with the original guidance of approximately 7% for the year with some leverage to our operating income line.  Then obviously with the reduction of our effective tax rate this year to the full year projected 22% to 23% from the adjusted 28% last year, our EPS will still be up nicely for the year compared to last year after adjusting out the TCJA impact on our deferred taxes last year.  With that, we will now open this call up for comments. Chris, will you please open the lines? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning, Kevin and Dave. Kevin Williams : Good morning. David Foss : Good morning. David Togut : What\u2019s your assessment of the competitive impact on your business from Fiserv\u2019s announced acquisition of First Data? And then, just as a related question, any impact expected on your joint venture with First Data and PSCU as a result? David Foss : Okay, Dave. This will probably be a little bit of a long answer, but I will take a shot at both of those questions. So first off, as far as the overall competitive impact, we\u2019ve talked many times in the past about the fact that our two major competitors are larger than we are. They\u2019ve been larger than us for a long time.  We have a very long track record of winning against them even though they both have been very significantly involved in the payments side of the business and they are core competitors, of course Fiserv on both the banking and the credit union side of our business. So, the competitive landscape, they are much larger than they were before assuming this deal closes.  But, as far as we are concerned, it\u2019s business as usual competing with them and again, we have been winning significant market share and I expect us to continue to do that. As far as the existing partnership, so if you think that you need to keep in mind with regard to the First Data partnership that we have, first off, the role of First Data in the partnership was simply the process transactions.  Right, they are not reselling, they are not active in the sale process with us. They don\u2019t install anything. They don\u2019t support anything. They never talk to a Jack Henry customer and the model was that Jack Henry sells installs and supports the solution. The front-end tools that the Jack Henry customer uses come from PSCU.  The First Data role was to process transactions. So our expectation is that, when we \u2013 assuming this deal is completed that the processing engine will still be in place and that they will continue to process transactions for us. So, we sell, we install, we support as a Jack Henry solution. They just happen to be processing engine on read with the PSCU tools laying over the top. So that\u2019s the model. Just to make sure we are clear on what it is that we are doing with First Data. The other thing I would point out is, so, now First Data becomes part of Fiserv, we have \u2013 we don\u2019t talk about it lot, but we work in a competition environment every day.  So people we cooperate with one day and we are competing with the next, and that\u2019s been our role with Fiserv for many years. So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever mentioned it on one of these calls, but we were partnered with them for years on their Cash Edge solution. We just recently got out of that partnership because we inherited a better answer through another solution.  But we had a very successful partnership for years. And so my anticipation is that we can do the same thing here. We have a long-term agreement in place today with First Data that includes pricing and service level agreements and so on.  I have talked to the executive leadership team at First Data several times since this deal was announced as to ensure that everything stays in place going forward and I am confident that our processing requirements continue as we go forward. We would become a significant customer for Fiserv. So, it\u2019s not a smart thing for you to make trouble for a significant customer.  Obviously, we will have to work through all that as time goes by, but it\u2019s in their best interest to make sure that we are happy and successful working with them. So, I think if you put all those things together, the future is still bright for Jack Henry. We have \u2013 we are totally committed to this platform. We are having great success already and I don\u2019t see that changing as a result of this acquisition. David Togut : Understood. Thanks for that. If I could just dig into the gross margins a bit, Kevin, I appreciate all the helpful callouts on operating margin impacts, but was there anything specific behind the 100 basis point decline in gross margin year-over-year? Was that the new pay-for-performance program? David Foss : Well, that was part of \u2013 there is also the increased cost in our move to the new payments platform Dave. I mean, we are continuing to add resources in the first half of the year, in fact, we are still adding some. And then remember, we are unable to take any cost out at this point, because we still have to keep the two platforms in place.  We have to keep all the developers in place. We have to continue to keep those compliant with the cards payments requirements. And as we \u2013 as Dave mentioned, we now moved 207 of our existing customers over to the new platform. We are now having to pay a per click fee on every transaction of those 2017 customers are processing. So, the costs are going to continue to increase and continue to put headwind on our margins until we are able to get all of our customers off one of those platforms. So we can shut one of them down and start taking some cost out.  So, that was in my opening comments as we are going to continue to see increased margin pressure, especially in the payments segment for the next year plus until we can get through this migration process. David Togut : Got it. Thanks. And then, just walking through some of the revenue growth trends in the three reporting segments, very nice acceleration in payments, revenue growth to 13 from 10. But we saw some deceleration both in the core and the complementary revenue. Any callouts, A, behind the acceleration in payments and sustainability and then some of decel in the other two segments? David Foss : Well, so, on the core side, David, I mentioned in my opening comments that it was primarily from our implementation revenues, because you also say 100% of our new banking core customers are going outsourcing and probably and close to 80% of our new credit union customers are going outsourcing. And that implementation revenue has to be spread over the contracts.  We are an in-house customer. You actually recognize that implementation revenue upfront when you actually deliver the software. So, that\u2019s the biggest hit we were seeing on the core side. Complementary is somewhat the same. There is also some implementation challenges there, because again, as we are installing these complementary products and an outsourcing solution, we have to spread that revenue.  So that\u2019s really the only headwinds we are seeing. I mean, as Dave mentioned, we continue to see very strong sales and very strong deliveries in products across both banking and credit unions in core and complementary. Obviously, payments had some increase from some of the acquisitions. So, I don\u2019t know that that growth is totally sustainable.  But it will continue to see very nice growth as we continue to add new customers in just about every bucket of our payments, which is obviously as we talked about before this, three different buckets in our payments offerings and all three of those are showing nice growth. David Togut : Understood. And just a quick final question for me. Dave, you called out a $35 billion asset bank that you signed on for the new Banno digital suite. Can you talk about the drivers of that win? That\u2019s certainly a very large win in terms of asset size and then, do you expect that to lay the groundwork if you will for more banks in that size range? David Foss : So, firs off, we won that contract many months ago, right. My point was that they went live in this quarter. So we signed that deal many months ago. And are we targeting $35 billion banks with the Banno solution? We are not. We are targeting banks and credit unions running the spectrum. My key point there is, that if a solution that is working very well, I mean they are very happy, I just recently talked to their CEO about the rollout and they are very happy with the rollout, very happy with the solution and I think the significant thing about that solution is regardless of the size of the institution.  It positions our customer to compete heads up against, primarily the two that \u2013 a lot of people call out every day, BOA and J.P. Morgan Chase is, they are investing in billions in their technology to serve their consumers through the digital channel. And this solution, our Banno solution, positions our customers very well to compete in that environment.  The key thing and I stressed it in my opening comments, and I\u2019ll just say it here too. Three different modules in Banno. So, Banno Online is what we used think of as online banking. Banno Mobile, of course, mobile banking and then there is Banno Conversations and that\u2019s been the real differentiator for this large institution and several of our other customers in that they can communicate with their consumer in the channel in the banking channel. They can do chats essentially with their consumer through their helpdesk and that's a differentiator for our solution and it\u2019s definitely a differentiator for these customers and it\u2019s one of the things that really attracted this particular customer to that solution. So, we expect certainly large banks and credit unions to adopt this.  But we also expect a lot of institutions that are smaller than that because it\u2019s a strategic solution for them to compete with the Tier-1 banks in the United States. Kevin Williams : Hey, Dave. One more comment too. I highlighted implementation revenue being down, but that also goes hand-in-hand with our license revenue because as more and more of our new core customers go outsourced obviously.  We are not selling license revenue and in this quarter a year ago we had a very large win of merger that drove quite a bit of license and implementation revenue in the quarter, which made sort of a tough comp for both core and complementary compared to a year ago. David Togut : Understood. Thank you very much. Appreciated. David Foss : You bet. Kevin Williams : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Kartik Mehta : Hey, good morning, Dave and Kevin. Dave, your perspective on how your customers are feeling and if you look at kind of spending as we look at 2019, kind of converted 2018, how you think that will trend for the banks and credit unions? David Foss : Sure. So, I mentioned earlier that the sales pipeline is up 26% over where we ended in June. The reason I mentioned that was because in June, I talked about at the end of the June quarter, I talked about how significant the pipeline was going into the new fiscal year.  Frankly, I am shocked that the pipeline is up so significantly over where we were last June. So the interest in Jack Henry solutions, the spending environment today is definitely very strong. I did yesterday, for the first time as CEO, a sort of a - that some bankers were starting to get a little bit concerned about \u2013 as they look into calendar 2020, starting to get concerned about the \u2013 where the economy is going and that kind of thing.  But the good news for us is that they are focusing a lot of their attention now on preparing for a potential downturn in the economy. So, the digital suite for example that I just mentioned when I was talking to Dave, very important to them to position themselves to compete going forward with a digital solution.  Lending is still strong and so, I have that in my comments. Our commercial lending solution is getting great interest. That is helping them position for the future. And then the other topic that\u2019s high on their list is the efficiency.  Their efficiency ratio is a key metric for our customers and that too helps them as they kind of position themselves to make sure that they can weather any economic downturn that might come. So, right now, spending environment is very strong. I don\u2019t see any slowdown as far as what our sales reps are seeing.  And I am of course monitoring things like the report that I just referenced that would indicate that in 2020, maybe there is a little bit of a concern about the economy, but we are not seeing any impacts right now as far as sales are concerned. Kevin Williams : Yes, I would also add to that Kartik, right now, we continue to see a lot of activity in core valuation. There is just an enormous amount of core valuations going on out there. I have a weekly call with our sales teams to review some of the activity that\u2019s going on out there. And it\u2019s just amazing how strong that continues to be. Kartik Mehta : And then, Dave, just maybe, backdrop on your comments about 2020. One of the thoughts was as you move to this new credit and debit card portfolio, maybe some of your banks would be interested in issuing their own credit card as a way to generate more fee income. Have you seen a change in that trend at all.  Do you still see interest or what, maybe the economy, their concern about the economy is that waiting a little bit? David Foss : No, I think as the opposite. I think that the opportunity to issue on the credit card side helps them potentially if there were to be some kind of downturn in the economy. So, no, absolutely no slowdown as far as interest is concerned. Things are good right now as far as sales are concerned. Kartik Mehta : And Kevin, just one last question. I know you talked about the deconversion fees obviously have an impact for you this year. I mean, what is the long-term \u2013 I imagine the long-term it\u2019s a little bit more positive impact because you are not seeing these customers migrate away or merge away and is there a way to look at maybe the revenue impact from this as you move to the next year \u2013 next fiscal year? Kevin Williams : Well, like we said in the fourth quarter, I mean, that\u2019s why we are bringing up \u2013because we have no control over no one\u2019s ability. And understand that, I mean, 90 \u2013 I mean, close to 100% of deconversion revenue comes from M&A activity.  So, it\u2019s just when our banks and credit union get acquired and they have to pay out these long-term contracts, so we have no control that with no visibility for that. So, there is really no way I can predict what\u2019s going into next year.  I mean, the only way I know for this quarter and basically the second half is, typically, we get notified three to six months before they actually deconvert when the project they are going to deconvert. But again, under the old revenue recognition rules, we could recognize one penny of revenue until they actually deconvert and wrote the check.  Under the new revenue recognition rules, when they give us notice and sign a pay for us, we have to start spreading that estimated deconversion free revenue from that point to the projected deconversion date. If the date shifts, then we have to readjust how that gets spread. So, I don\u2019t have any more visibility into a deconversion fees for 2020 that I did for this year going into 2019. Kartik Mehta : Yes, maybe, Kevin my question was more about the fact that you are not going to have these deconversion fees. I guess the revenue is going to \u2013 you are going to keep the revenue. Kevin Williams : That is good news. I mean, we are going to get revenue from these customers and so, obviously, the headwinds will be less going into next year than they were going into this year absolutely. David Foss : I don\u2019t know that, sort of, I may \u2013 I have mentioned it in my comments. So the good news in all of this is, that fewer customers are deconverting. So, on the core side, we don\u2019t typically lose the customer because they choose to go with one of our competitors, but M&A, it certainly has an impact.  But then, we\u2019ve been pretty open on these calls about the fact that in the payments business, we were losing customers. They were leaving Jack Henry and they were paying a deconversion fees sometimes to leave us because they weren\u2019t happy with the platform and of course, that has virtually come to a stop now.  So, the good news is, that revenue stays in-house for Jack Henry continues to build both because we are not losing customers through M&A and we are not losing customers on the payment side that are in fact leaving us. Quantifying what the impact of that is as you know, reduced headwind, I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s \u2013 there is any way to accurately do that, but you can just logically see where that\u2019s a positive for us going forward. If you look at \u2013 if you take the long-term view of Jack Henry, that\u2019s a really good signal for us. The other thing is to Kevin\u2019s comment earlier that almost every core customer was signing these days on the banking side are going outsourced.  And much more, many more of the credit union customers that we sign today are choosing outsourced model and we are continuing to do these in to out migrations. I mentioned in my comments, the number of in to outs that we did 17 in-house to outsourcing. All of those set us up with recurring revenue. So if you take the long-term view, if those are all good signs for Jack Henry. Kevin Williams : And, Kartik, one more comment, you and I talked about this before. There is no way to project what future revenues there is tied to a deconversion fee because it could be a bank or credit union that has six months left on a contract that has a plethora of our products.  They are going to pay us a huge deconversion or it could be a small bank that has four years left, that only has a couple of products that they are going to pay a much smaller fee. So you really can\u2019t tie the deconversion fees to forward going revenue. Kartik Mehta : Okay, got it. Kevin Williams : Thank you very much. Kartik Mehta : Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Heckmann with Davidson. Your line is now open. Peter Heckmann : Good morning, gentlemen. Just wanted to follow-up, make sure we are following the number. Can you, Kevin, just for reference purposes, give us that guidance again in terms of looking at adjusted \u2013 I think you said, adjusted revenue which would exclude term fees should still for the year be up about 7%? Kevin Williams : Yes. Peter Heckmann : Okay. You gave your commentary with regard to the impact for the big drop in high margin deconversion fees in the third quarter. But for the year, it still sounded that this we are looking at that kind of high-single-digits to maybe potentially 10% EPS growth for the year. Is that the right way you interpret it? Kevin Williams : On a GAAP \u2013 well, on a non-GAAP basis, yes, Pete. I mean, once you back deconversion fees out, I mean, revenue growth should still be roughly 7% for the year. Operating margins will get some leverage from that and then, obviously a little more leverage to EPS from that \u2013 from the lower tax rate.  So, obviously, EPS on an adjusted basis if you back out the TCJA, again, we got some crazy numbers compared to last year, because of the impact of TCJA on our deferred taxes last year which was well over $1 of EPS. So, you have to back that out to really get an apples-to-apples comparison that you have. So we will still have a nice EPS growth if you adjust all that out. Peter Heckmann : Okay, okay. And kind of a good just again for reference purposes, a good full year adjusted fiscal 2018 EPS figure, is that around $3.30? Kevin Williams : I am sorry, say again, Pete. Peter Heckmann : Just, if we are looking at a kind of a non-GAAP EPS figure for fiscal year 2018, would you put that figure around $3.30? Kevin Williams : I think it\u2019s right at $3.29, Pete. Peter Heckmann : $3.29, great, great. Okay, and then just, fundamentally, I did want to follow-up on Zelle, you had talked about some of the pilots that were occurring late last summer and through the fall. I wanted to see what type of uptake you are seeing there if any in volumes and thanks for all that appetite to adopt or incorporate that service. David Foss : Well, so, we talked about was that - Zelle is the fact that they have had so much trouble bringing the processors live. So, they \u2013 today, Zelle has 60 institutions live on their platform. 15 of those are one holding company, eight are whatever it is where the original funding banks and then the other 12 that were part of the original clear exchange program.  So, 35, 40, whatever that as up to \u2013 of them, we are part of the original plan and then there is another 20 or so that they brought live. All of them have been point-to-point connections, whether they have developed their own interface from the bank into the Zelle platform. None of the processors are live as processors.  So, but, we have sold 15 so far. We have customers that are in testing. And so there is a lot of interest, but as far as live volume going through us as a processor, meaning, we are aggregating transactions from a bunch of banks and processing them live. We don\u2019t have any of those live today, nor do any of the other processors have them live today. Peter Heckmann : Got it. Got it. Thanks for the update. David Foss : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Glenn Greene : Thanks. Good morning, Kevin and David. And David, thanks for the clarification on the First Data situation, we\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions on that. I guess, the first question is, could you guys sort of talk a little bit about the drivers for the payment strength the 13% in the quarter? And maybe if you could parse it across the key product areas that drove that? David Foss : Sure, so the three primary product areas, so first off, we have what we call EPS, Enterprise Payment Solutions, EPS is our traditional remote deposit capture and ACH processing platform. So, EPS was up approximately 6% I guess, as far as revenue is concerned for the quarter.  But that\u2019s a business that \u2013 it\u2019s an ACH-based business, but continues to grow nicely not only through our banking customers, but through partnerships that we do through EPS and we talked about some of those in the past. The second is our Bill Pay business. iPay which is traditional aggregator business. Transaction counts there were up almost 4% for the quarter.  So, that business continues to grow nicely and then the third is, the card processing business. So, it\u2019s the transactions that we are processing through the First Data platform, but also the legacy platforms that we are hosting today. Transaction counts are up nicely there. They were up almost 9% for the quarter. So, it\u2019s kind of across the board.  The things to kind of zero in on is, the point that I made earlier about the number of customers that we now have live on the new platform, I mentioned that 19 customers signed with us today that were never on the old platform. So, it\u2019s not that we will be migrating them, it\u2019s that we will, it\u2019s that they are brand new customers to Jack Henry.  I also mentioned that, of the customers we do have live processing today, 21 of them were never on the old platform. So there is new revenue that\u2019s coming in, in addition to migrating customers over and seeing growth out of those customers, because they have more functionality on the new platform. We are adding new customers through the \u2013 through signing customers because they like the functionality that we have particularly with the PSCU technology laying over the top. So, all three areas are going well. But certainly we are seeing nice growth in CPS because of all those customers that we are adding net new to Jack Henry. Kevin Williams : And one other thing, Glenn, so, probably, that next is margin. So, as we add these new customers, obviously, that helps to offset some of the headwinds on margins of the customers we are migrating over, which makes it even more of a challenge and difficult to quantify what the true margin impact is going to be in 2020 when we take all these costs out, because, the more new customers we are adding, they have to offset those margin headwinds. So, just food for thought. Glenn Greene : Yes, I\u2019ll follow-up on the payments, both struggling on, see how you get the 13%, but I\u2019ll take that offline. I wanted to follow-up on Pete Heckman\u2019s question, because I heard a couple things on the margin expectations.  Kevin, you had said in your prepared comment it\u2019s somewhat flattish and then to Pete\u2019s question, you suggested some margin leverage and I thought, I also heard you say flattish EBIT overall, implying sort of a 23% tax rate, my back on the envelope math gotten me $3.55, $3.60-ish EPS.  I just want to know if that sort of stand at each x with how you are thinking about it a little bit different than your answer to what, to Pete\u2019s? Kevin Williams : So, Glenn, the operating income for Q3 is going to be basically flat in a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, when you back out the deconversion fees, and other non-GAAP adjustments, you are going to have some decent leverage to the operating margin line.  So, your EPS for the adjustment is pretty much in line in that $3.55 to $3.60, somewhere in there for the year after we adjust out. So I hope that answers your question.  But, in my opening comments, revenue growth, even it\u2019s going to be in the 5.5% to 6% on a GAAP basis, on a non-GAAP basis, it\u2019s just still be \u2013 roughly 7% based on what we are looking at now backing up the deconversion fees with very little leverage to the operating line on a GAAP basis but some decent leverage on a non-GAAP basis.  Obviously, when you have a $20 million headwind from deconversion fees for the year, that\u2019s going to have some impact on your margin from a GAAP reported basis. Glenn Greene : Understood. I appreciate that and one more question. Any more current thinking on where your margins trend once you get past the debit conversion? Kevin Williams : Well, again, like I did say, the challenge there is, as we add new customers which we\u2019ve already added several, that\u2019s new revenue and new margins which is actually at higher margins that are old customers are that we\u2019re deconverting of.  So we continue to increase cost, but we also have that offset of new revenue, new margins which is kind of reducing that headwind. So, at this time, it\u2019s still kind of a challenge and I think I have been pretty consistent that by the end of this fiscal year, I hopefully will be able to give you much clear guidance on what that impact is going to be in the second half of 2020. Glenn Greene : All right, great. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim Willi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Tim Willi : Hi, thanks good morning. Couple questions. One, I was curious if you could just talk about the pricing environment. I am curious about some of the faster growing areas like mobile, if there is just any sort of callouts around some of your, I guess, major revenue drivers where you feel like the pricing environment is maybe favorable versus under any kind of traditional or extraordinary pressures. Sort of trying to get a gauge on that? And I have a couple follow-ups. David Foss : Sure, so, in the mobile area, definitely a differentiated solution with our Banno solution, because we have a single platform that\u2019s doing what we traditionally call the online banking, what we traditionally called mobile banking, we have an advertising platform through it. We have the conversations component that I just talked about earlier.  And we can host the financial institutions website all in the same digital channel. It is definitely a differentiated solution. So, when you think about price, it\u2019s not like we are trying to line up our pricing per widget with somebody else, because it\u2019s a totally differentiated solution.  Now we are in a competitive environment and we have to deal with all the standard competition stuff, but it\u2019s a good place for us to be as far as having differentiated solution and being able to sell value as opposed to just trying compete per widget with somebody who is also with exactly the same thing.  But if you look across the broader product suite, as I said earlier, the spending environment is strong today and we are not seeing the intense pressure as far as price compression. There are certain pockets here and there, but it\u2019s not like it was say three four years ago where there was real intense price compression going on in several areas of the business. Today that\u2019s just not the case. I think part of it is because several of our technology solutions really are differentiated. We talked about treasury management for example, it is a unique new solution. We brought mobile on the mobile component live this past quarter. I highlighted earlier, but to have a treasury management solution with a complete set of mobile functionality is a real differentiator. So, it\u2019s \u2013 there is pressure. We are in a competitive environment. We always deal with that. But I think several of our technology solutions now are highly differentiated from our competition and so that always helps when you are talking price. Tim Willi : Great. And then, just two follow-ups, I guess, they are just somewhat related. But just curious about anything on the M&A environment that\u2019s changed since the last couple of calls where I think the answer has been things are really expensive. There is no shortage stuff being presented to you. And maybe you could address that directly and then I just had a follow-up that sort of ties into that as well. David Foss : Things are really expensive and there is no shortage of stuff being presented to us. I mean, it really is the same environment that we\u2019ve been in for quite some time. I got an updated number just the other day. There is still $1.5 trillion of PE money sitting on the sidelines waiting to be invested.  We certainly see that when we are in competitive deals, that private equity, they are looking for places to put their money and so, they are pretty ready to outbid on deals. So it\u2019s definitely very competitive, but, you saw us do the two little deals in October, the Agiletics deal and the BOLTS deal. And then, Ensenta a year ago now. All of those deals were competitive, but Jack Henry often times has an edge because of reputation and culture. And you often times don\u2019t think of culture as winning the day when it comes to a competitive bid acquisition. But it really does help in those situations and so we continue to ensure that that message is out there and when we do an acquisition, we will take care of the employees and the customers.  And certainly the seller but we are very focused on making sure that the employees and the customers will end in an environment that\u2019s going to help them be successful long-term. Tim Willi : Great. And then, so my follow-up on that was, this has come up periodically, obviously, Jack Henry is hyper focused on customer experience retention culture, we are in a very dynamic tech environments, open banking, open computing type environment.  Do you have any different stands around internal developments versus partnerships in the lieu of finding attractive M&A opportunities? Is that anything at all where there is a \u2013 one way versus the other about, maybe looking at partnerships and building that ecosystem out more so than you would have thought a year ago or 18 months ago?  Or do you feel like anything your customers are looking for if you can find a way to acquire it, you got the bandwidth and the resources to develop it internally? David Foss : So, it\u2019s a good question. We\u2019ve talked quite a bit in the last couple of years about the whole build by partner methodology that we go through. Whenever we have a need for a solution that our customers are looking for, we go through this build by partner now just trying to find what is the best approach for us. So you\u2019ve seen us build some solutions like treasury management, you have seen us partnered like First Data deal and then, the acquisitions that we just talked about. So we have done a lot of that. All three of those in the last year or two and certainly Jack Henry has a history in all those areas.  So, with the points that you mentioned, I don\u2019t know that there is any need for us to change the way we do that. And you kind of ask to define the word partner in the question that you asked. So a partner usually implies that we are \u2013 there is a revenue share and all that kind of stuff.  Keep in mind, Jack Henry forever has been \u2013 had a very open approach to working with third-party vendors and we don\u2019t require a rev share. We\u2019ve opened up our core systems for years to make it easy for third-parties to innovate into our core to enable our customers to get whatever it is that they are looking for.  And that\u2019s lastly the strategy hasn\u2019t changed and frankly it feeds perfectly into the open banking concept that you are talking about. But our competitors have not had that approach. We\u2019ve been open for years and have provided the tools for years to help enable third-party products with Jack Henry cores.  Now we need to expand on that and we are close to rolling out the complete set of open APIs that kind of expends that kind of functionality, but we are well positioned to address the open banking concept as it\u2019s being defined today. Kevin Williams : And Tim, it really depends on the situation, because, obviously, as back to \u2013 I think your second question, we are obviously always getting help with opportunities to buy companies and if they fit and it makes sense then, yes, we will try to buy them.  But on the other hand, when customers come to us, today\u2019s example is treasury management, you look at there, that we have the cash, did we have the cash to build it? No. But we found the right manager to hire them and build a team and build the solution because it make more sense because there is really in an effort to buy. But when you look at like Ensenta, we didn\u2019t have \u2013 we couldn\u2019t build a replica of that, so it made more sense to just buy it and the same way that we see, makes more sense to partner because we couldn\u2019t build it and there was nothing out there for us to buy.  So, it really depends on the situation which direction we are going to ultimately end up going. Tim Willi : Great. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks very much. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. Joseph Foresi : Hi, good morning. My first question, I want to go back to the Fiserv FDC deal, I guess, two questions there. One, do you believe that by making that acquisition, it strengthened Fiserv\u2019s position in the market, particularly around core processing? In other words, did they now become a little bit more attractive because they have sort of the front-end and the back-end?  And then, my second is, does it really makes sense to continue with the FDC processing aspect of your partnership? Or would it make more sense to do with a different merchant, because couldn\u2019t \u2013 Fiserv go to clients and theoretically say, well, we\u2019ve got the processing, we\u2019ve got the back-end, when that put them in a better competitive position. David Foss : Well, you don\u2019t believe first off, that it strengthens them at all on the core side, because this acquisition has nothing to do with their core. As far as the payments equation, we believe that the platform that we have with First Data is a terrific solution for Jack Henry.  And what Fiserv does is as far as their sales strategy as I mentioned earlier, we will be a very large customer for them and so, we have to keep that in mind as they go forward and develop their sales strategy. So, I don\u2019t think that would be a prudent move for them to try to do something like what you are suggesting. But you will have to ask Fiserv what their strategy is, I am not sure. Kevin Williams : And the other thing, Joe, remember, our agreement is really with PSCU and PSCU has agreement with FDC which they\u2019ve had a relationship with First Data for thirty years. So, that relationship has been in place for ever and our agreement was with PSCU to process our transactions through PSCU to FDC and FDC is just basically processing the transactions. Joseph Foresi : Got it. Okay. And then just on the competitive environment, we've seen some press releases around Infosys helping some banks maybe move some of the work to the cloud and then, of course, I think we\u2019ve heard some rumblings of Temenos in the Midwest in a bank there. I was just wondering what your thoughts were about the move to the cloud and Temenos since sort of the structure of the industry at this point and if you are seeing any changes on the competitive landscape? David Foss : No major changes on the competitive landscape and Temenos and Infosys for that matter have been working to establish a foothold in the U.S. for many years. So there is nothing particularly new there. They are working on implementing deposits for a single bank in the Midwest.  But getting deposits, loans, general ledger, everything rolled out is a tall order. So, but, again, they \u2013 both of them have been working in the U.S. trying to establish a foothold in the U.S. for a long time. So I don\u2019t see any significant change there. As far as moving to the cloud, we have the same type of projects going on at Jack Henry.  Some products are already public cloud residents, others were in the process of moving things there as they make sense. So, I think, we are positioned well to be competitive with either of those players if they get a stronger presence in the U.S. Joseph Foresi : Got it. And then the last question for me, our channel checks assume to imply that bank spending, at least on IT, continues to be good heading into next year or this year at this point. Can you just give us your thoughts on spending patterns this year versus last year? And maybe call out where you see some of the major areas and how your positioned in them? Thanks. David Foss : Yes, so I mentioned earlier that our pipeline is up 26% or where it was at the end of June and you may or may not recall, but I highlighted at the end of June last year, because it was up so significantly and I was frankly kind of shocked with how large the pipeline was getting.  And so, here is the sales team now after receiving a quota increase, there is already at a 109% year-to-date and the pipeline is up 26%. So the interest in Jack Henry\u2019s solutions, the overall spending environment, very strong right now. But keep in mind, almost everything that we are selling today and I won\u2019t say everything else, almost everything that we sell today is a recurring revenue type of agreement.  So, you don\u2019t see a revenue pop in the quarter. You see that come over time and the good news is, customers are signing long-term contracts for almost anything that they are buying from Jack Henry today. So, spending environment is strong where we see particular interest. I highlighted a couple of these already. The digital channel does a lot of activity there. Kevin mentioned, there is so much activity going on in the core space right now which normally you don\u2019t see big blips when it comes to the core business. It\u2019s usually pretty steady both on the banking and the credit union side. We tend to win a very large portion of those deals that go up for decision.  But right now, there is just a lot of deals in play and so that\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s good. De novo activity is up. So, they are been 24 new banks chartered in the past twelve months. We won 13 of those, so more than half. The other less than half have gone to a variety of other different vendors, but Jack Henry has won more than half. That\u2019s good for Jack Henry because they tend to grow quickly. And that produces revenue. So, spending environment is strong. The overall environment is good and again, I think the technology solutions that we are offering today have really positioned our company well to be competitive. Kevin Williams : And Joe, I would tell you that, Dave and I both \u2013 our sales organization to make sure to scrub the sales pipeline. And I can assure you that the numbers that Dave is quoting are all very much sales opportunities and legitimate. Joseph Foresi : Got it. Thank you. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is now open. David Koning : Yes, hey, thanks guys. So, just a couple quick ones on guidance. I think you said Q3 we should take I think consensus was $0.90 we should take that down by $0.13 to $0.77 is it roughly what you are saying on that, right? Kevin Williams : Yes. David Koning : And did you say EBIT, go ahead, sorry. David Foss : Yes, I mean, so, Dave, obviously deconversion fees were down $6 million roughly in the first half of the year. We were able to basically overrule that with some of the pull forward of software subscriptions and different things. So it didn\u2019t have much of an impact, Kevin Williams : Because of 606. David Foss : Because of 606, yes, but when you have a $13 million headwind in this quarter and probably another $1 million decrease in deconversion fee to Q4, I don\u2019t see any alternatives other than to take guidance down. David Koning : Yes, that makes sense. And did you say EBIT for the year, I think the base, last year 357-ish, did you say that would be about flat in 2019s, so it would be another something right around that same number? Kevin Williams : For GAAP, yes. David Koning : Yes, okay. And then, one thing that was really encouraging. So margins in the first half, if you strip out term fees, I guess, your non-GAAP margins were actually up year-over-year despite all the implementation fees, despite the severance payments and all that stuff. So have some of those investments just been a little slower to start or is it just core margins have been just so good? Kevin Williams : Well, I mean, we actually had a decent first half in some areas like license fees, the software subscriptions were up nicely which obviously that\u2019s very nice margins, payments business was up nicely in the first half. But again, we continue to add additional cost. We continue to add double the fees for the payments platform migration.  So, we are going to see increased margin headwinds in the second half above what we saw in the first half. But, I mean, our associates and our managers has done an extremely good job in the first half to overcome and offset some of the increased cost we had in this \u2013 including depreciation, amortization from some of the new products and facilities upgrades that we did in the first half of the year. David Koning : Okay, good. And I guess, lastly, and it maybe a little corollary to this. Your revenue growth organic ex term fees and everything was about 3% in the first half. It\u2019s one of the strongest periods in the last five years.  So, is that \u2013 I mean, you mentioned some of the drivers, but I mean is a lot this just the pipeline of work is good that the new products are good and I mean, do you think we are just in a period that might be a little better than normal for the next couple of years? David Foss : Well, it is a combination of all that, Dave. But then also remember, 606 pulled some revenue forward in the first half which again is causing some headwind in the second half. So, revenue growth is not going to be 8% in the second half of the year. I mean, obviously, revenue growth is going to be down especially on a GAAP basis in the next two quarters to get us down to where I said that 5.5% to 6% growth.  So, obviously you can tell that Q3 and Q4 is going to be slightly, because we pull that back. But again, as I said on last quarter, it\u2019s going to take us a year if you get through all of the bumps and hurdles of 606 and trying to get into a normalized pattern. So, I think what you are seeing, Dave is, we are probably getting more into a normalized pattern where we are going to have a little more revenue growth in the first half. It\u2019s going to be a little more headwinds in the second half. But I think we are going to see that again next year. And then, the following year is kind of unknown, because that\u2019s when we finish the migration of the payments platform.  So we are going to be taking a lot of cost out. We will have anniversaried the new pay-for-performance bonus. So, there is going to be a lot of changes even in FY 2020, but even more than that in FY 2021. David Koning : Gotcha. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I really appreciate it. David Foss : You bet. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Dave. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens Incorporated. Your line is now open. Brett Huff : Good morning guys. How are you? Kevin Williams : Hey, Brett David Foss : Good. Brett Huff : One specific question and then a couple other product updates. When we did the math on incremental margins for the payments segment this quarter versus past quarter, it was above 60%. I think it was maybe 30% or 35% in 1Q. And Kevin, I think you called out, there is some M&A that helps, but Dave then you mentioned that the transaction counts are pretty good.  Is there something about the new M&A that made that margin go up? Or is it maybe some 606 stuff? Or is that anomalous or something we should think about? Kevin Williams : There is nothing really M&A related that would cause the margins to go up and really not 606, Brett, because actually 606 goes the other way. 606 actually takes revenue out and carves it back into license implementation. So, it\u2019s \u2013 I mean, it was just a really good quarter. It was a nice mix of the three buckets of revenue that Dave pointed out. So, I mean, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s actually sustainable, but it was just a really good quarter within the base and the mix of payments sales that we had in the quarter. Brett Huff : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, two product questions. We\u2019ve talked a little bit about treasury management, commercial cash management. I know you guys have been selling those for a while. It sounds like they are selling well and that it\u2019s helping retain some of those larger customers that were looking around.  Can you tell us about the competitive environment there? I know it\u2019s a very fragmented market. There is some legacy players and there is a couple of new players and I think you are taking share. Are you all focused on your base first? Or is this something that ProfitStars can go out and sell? Give us an update on the competitive environment there? David Foss : It\u2019s a good question. So we are \u2013 and you are reading that environment very well. We booked ten new treasury management deals in the quarter. And you are absolutely right. It\u2019s larger customers who are looking for a solution to serve their commercial customers better. There is a lot of interest in that area. I highlighted commercial \u2013 of our clients to serve their commercial base earlier when I was talking about lending. But it\u2019s certainly true on the treasury side as well. The environment out there as far as companies offering a full treasury solution is fragmented. As far as I know, and I am not an absolute expert in treasury, but I am pretty involved, as far as I know, nobody has the breadth of functionality that we have with this new solution including the fully enabled mobile platform that we have or the mobile functionality that we\u2019ll have at the treasury solution.  And that\u2019s getting a lot of attention because it\u2019s a very robust platform to begin with. But then it has all the functionality on the mobile side. So, there are players out there. I don\u2019t know that I could highlight anybody that has a solution that\u2019s as modern as the platform that we have and that has the breadth of functionality when you add in the mobile piece.  So I think that\u2019s helping us win new customers. To your question about the strategy, as far as the base that we are approaching, that\u2019s exactly the way we defined it originally. We wanted to go after the Jack Henry base first. Make sure that we have some success within our core base.  But eventually, this will be a ProfitStar solution that we\u2019ll sell outside of the Jack Henry core base just like many of the other solutions that we offer. Brett Huff : And then, of those ten, are those competitive takeaways or are those banks that are looking to grow and want to establish a commercial banking practice? And then I have a \u2013 the last question is, I want an update on the fraud system. It seems like that\u2019s kind of a sweeper and an important one. But I\u2019ll stop there. Thank you. David Foss : Yes, that\u2019s I can\u2019t quote for you accurately how many of those were competitive takeaways and how many had never had a treasury solution. I would hazard to guess but most of them had something. They probably had a cash management solution which is a more rudimentary version of full treasury management.  But there were probably a few that didn\u2019t have anything significant before, but most of them are either converting off of somebody else\u2019s treasury solution or they are probably upgrading from a cash management solution to full-on treasury management. And as far as the fraud solution, the partnership with SaaS, yes, that has been a sleeper as you said. We have a lot of interest from our customers. But as we\u2019ve disclosed last year when we first started talking about it, there were several modules for us to both rollout. There was kind of a nine phased rollout of that product.  That continues on. We don\u2019t have a whole lot of customers live with that yet, because there is still a lot of development work going on in the partnership. But a year from now, my expectation is, we will have a lot more to talk about the best solution. Brett Huff : Great. Thank you. David Foss : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Kevin Williams for any further remarks. Kevin Williams : Thank you. Again, I would like to repeat we are very pleased with the results from our ongoing operations and the efforts of all of our associates to take care of our customers. Our executives, managers and all of our associates continue to focus on what is best for our customers and our shareholders. With that, I want to thank you for joining us and Chris, would you please now provide the replay numbers for the listeners?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call will be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Justin. Good morning. Thank you all for joining us today for the Jack Henry & Associates third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. I\u2019m Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer, and on the call with me today is Dave Foss, our President and CEO. The agenda for this morning will be opening comments by me, and then I will turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the state of our business and the performance for the quarter. And then, I will get back on and provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release that we put out yesterday after market closed and then provide some guidance and then open the lines up for Q&A. I need to remind you that remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate, due to a number of risks and uncertainties and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday\u2019s press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. With that, I will now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work that went into producing those results for our third fiscal quarter. On our last quarterly call, we highlighted the fact that we expected de-conversion revenue to be down significantly in the third fiscal quarter, and that expectation was realized. As we've discussed previously, in many respects, this is a good problem to have, because although we experienced a short term revenue impact, it indicates that far fewer customers are de-converting, and their long term revenue contribution stays in place.  As you now know, de-conversion revenue is largely outside our control and very difficult to forecast. But we'll continue to do our best to set proper expectation on this topic, when we expect the revenue variances to be significant. For the third quarter, total revenue increased 2% for the quarter and increased 5%, excluding the impact of de-conversion fees from both quarters. Year to date, revenue is up 6% and is up 8% year to date, if you exclude the impact of de-conversion piece. The core segment of our business was the most heavily impacted by the decline of de-conversion revenue, but saw revenue increase of 1% for the quarter and an increase of 4%, if you exclude the impact of de-conversion fees from both quarters. Our payments segment performed well, posting a 3% increase in revenue this quarter, and a 6% increase, excluding the impact of de-conversion fees. Our complementary solutions businesses posted a 2% increase in revenue this quarter and a 5% increase, excluding the impact of de-conversion fees. As I mentioned in the press release, our sales teams again had a very solid quarter in Q3. We booked an almost unbelievable 18 new core wins in the third quarter alone, with 17 as competitive core takeaways and one de novo bank.  Additionally, we signed 20 new customers to our debit processing solution and booked 13 in- house to outsourcing deals between banking and Symitar. The sales organization exceeded quota again this quarter and continues to manage a solid pipeline for the remainder of the year. Jack Henry\u2019s full suite of modern, cloud enabled solutions continue to position us well to win share in the market.  Regarding our new debit and credit processing solution, we now have 358 customers live on the debit platform, including 37 customers installed as new rather than as a migration. We also have six new credit customers live on the platform. As we've highlighted on previous calls, all of these migrations and new installations have been successful, and our program continues to progress well. We're still on track to complete our core customer migrations by the end of fiscal 2020. We have, however, recently learned that it is highly likely that the migrations for the 80 or so non-core clients on our credit union platform will extend until November of 2020, because of the extra programming and testing effort required for these non-core customers. We will continue to work with this group of customers closely and move them up on the schedule as possible. As I referenced in the press release, we are very happy to have recently been recognized by Forbes Magazine as one of America's best large employers for the third year in a row. We were also recognized last month by American Banker as one of the top 50 companies to work for in the fintech space. Recognition like this comes as a result of these publications directly surveying employees at companies throughout the country. And we have no ability to influence these results.  As you can probably imagine, this type of recognition not only aids tremendously in employee retention, it also helps us continue to recruit the best and brightest in this time of very low unemployment. I want to thank all our employees for their continued commitment to our company and our customers. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst Day in Denver next week.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Dave. The service and support line of revenue decreased 1% compared to the prior year restated quarter. Remember, we restated the prior your numbers for ASC 606. Our license revenue was flat compared to last year. We continue to have headwinds from decreased implementation revenue due to almost all record installations electing the outsourced model or a private cloud with implementation revenue on these must be spread through the term of the contract under ASC 606, which is one of the reasons for the significant increase in deferred revenue compared to the prior year.  In-house support was up and almost offset the decrease in implementation revenues. Outsourcing and cloud services were up nicely to help offset the decrease and de-conversion fees were down 10.3 million, as we highlighted on last quarter\u2019s call that they're going to be down significantly this year over last year. The processing line of revenue grew 6% compared to the prior year and had no impact from de-conversion fees in this line of revenue. Total revenue was up 2% as reported and a little higher than 5%, adjusting for the de-conversion fees.  Reported consolidated operating margins were down from 24% last year to 20% this year, primarily due to the significant decrease in de-conversion fees. Without the impact of those, our non-GAAP operating margins decreased from 20% to 19% for the quarter compared to last year due to the two headwind impacts on operating margins this year, as we've discussed on previous calls. The first, the additional cost of processing our debit card customers transactions until we get them all migrated to the new platform as Dave was mentioning in his opening comments. And then second is the additional cost for the employee pay for performance plans that are being funded with a portion of the savings from the Tax Cuts and Job Act. Remember that we have been, had the benefit of reduced federal income tax this year compared to last year. Our operating margins for the year dropped from 25% to 23%. But for non-GAAP, remained flat at 22%. Our segment\u2019s operating margins continue to be very solid with small fluctuations, but the payments segment will continue to see increased margin headwind going forward as double of costs continue to increase as we migrate customers to the new platform. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.4% this year compared to 23.3% last year. For the balance of the year, our effective tax rate will increase and our projected total yearly effective tax rate is expected to wind up at 22%. For cash flow, included in total amortization, which was disclosed in the press release is -- in the cash flow review is the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions, which increased to 15.6 million year-to-date this fiscal year compared to 12.5 million last year.  Depreciation expense was down slightly for the quarter, but amortization was up due to more of our internally developed products being put into production. Remember, when a product gets to beta, we stopped capitalizing according to the accounting rules and begin amortizing over the projected estimated life. Our operating cash flow was 233.4 million for the first 9 months, which was essentially flat with last year. The significant increase in capital expenditures year-to-date was primarily due to the cash paid out in Q1 that we discussed on previous calls.  Our cash flows will have the same seasonality as historically with significantly higher Q1 and Q4 due to the billing and collection of our annual in-house maintenance billings. We invested 128.1 million back into our company through CapEx and developing products, which is up from 97 million a year ago, with much of the increases due to the datacenter upgrades we talked about in Q1. So now I\u2019ll give some update on our FY19 guidance. As we've discussed previously, when we provided estimated guidance at the beginning of the year that it was going to take a year or so to get the lumpiness out of the financials due to the new revenue recognition rules of ASC 606, due to software subscriptions and other items being recognized differently, our revenue grew 8.4% for the first half of the year. And as shown in Q3, our revenue growth is not as fast in the second half.  A significant headwind impact in the second half obviously is the de-conversion fees being down 10.3 million in Q3 alone compared to last year, which actually is a good thing long term is that means we're not losing as many customers through M&A. But it does create some challenges in year-over-year comparisons, which is why we back them out to show non-GAAP operations. It appears that de-conversion fees in Q4 will also be going down compared to the prior year. For the entire year, we're now projecting de-conversion fees to be down roughly $18 million compared to the previous year. As Dave mentioned, we're being very successful with new core wins. But out of the 42 new core wins this year, all but one has elected to go outsourcing and with the continued migration from in-house to our private cloud means lower license revenue and in-house implementation revenue, which this alone will create a headwind in Q4 of $5 million to $6 million compared to a year ago.  Also the impact of deferral of implementation revenue related to the new outsource customers and amortizing it over the life of the contract continues to add additional headwinds. With all these different items impacting revenue, our total revenue in Q4 should be roughly up 3% compared to last year Q4. However, even with all these headwinds in the second half of the year, our GAAP revenue for the entire fiscal year will still be above 5%.  And non-GAAP revenue, excluding de-conversion fees wouldn\u2019t have been right at 67% growth range that we originally guided at the very beginning of the year. Due to these revenue headwinds combined with the additional cost headwinds from our payments platform migration and the new pay for performance plan put in place at the beginning of the year, we project operating income will be down approximately 6 million or 7% compared to last year's Q4.  However, on a non-GAAP basis, our operating income will also be right in line with original guidance for the full year of 6% to 7% growth compared to the previous year. The final headwind for Q4 is our effective tax rate, which will increase to 24.5% compared to 19.6% last year. With this increase in Q4, we should end the fiscal year with an effective tax rate of 22% for the fiscal year \u201819. Due to all these items impacting Q4, the consensus estimates for Q4 needs to decrease by $0.07 to $0.08 from the current $0.84 consensus estimate. Therefore, in summary, on a non-GAAP basis, adjusting revenue for de-conversion fees and adjusting operating expenses for the new bonus plan put in place with a portion of the savings from the TCJA, revenue and operating income growth should both end the year pretty much in line with the original guidance of approximately 6% to 7% for the year that we provided last August. We're very early in our budget process for FY20 at this point.  However, it appears that we will continue to grow revenue at the 6% to 7% range for FY20, very similar to what we did in FY19. Our effective tax rate for FY20 should be approximately 23% to 23.5% for the entire fiscal year. Further guidance on revenues and margins will be provided on our earnings year end call in August when we report year-end earnings. That concludes our opening comments. We're now ready to take questions. Justin, will you please open the call lines for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Joseph Foresi : Hi, my first question is just around the competitive landscape. So now we've had two of your competitors by some fairly large merchant acquirers. I'm wondering, have you seen any change in the business from a core processing perspective? And I know FTC does some processing for you, maybe you can give us an update, if there's any change there. David Foss : It\u2019s Dave. So first off, as far as the competitive landscape, no changes on the core side of the business, as I mentioned in my opening comments. We signed 18 brand new core customers, 17 competitive takeaways and one de novo. I don't recall a quarter ever where we signed that many. We've had several quarters in the mid-teens, mid-18 is a very strong quarter. So, there's no, no negatives, as far as what sales is experiencing currently or customer prospect sentiment. We've already obviously signed some customers in the current quarter that we will be announcing in August. And we've had lots of customer conversations. No, no great concern out there and no negatives, as far as customers or prospects are concerned on the core side. So my expectation continues to be very positive, regarding the core side of our business.  As far as the relationship with First Data, it continues to be a very solid relationship. I think I've mentioned before, if not, on the call, certainly in conversations with some of you that our working relationship with First Data is terrific and continues to be really solid. We're converting customers at a rate of almost 50 or migrating customers at a rate of almost 50 a month now. And I see that continuing for the foreseeable future with virtually no issues of any significance. So really, really excellent relationship and continuing forward as it was before any of the announcements happened. Joseph Foresi : Okay, and then just on demand, your competitors seem to be implying at least FIS did that there's been an uptick in demand? Are you seeing that and anything to read into these new signings? Are you -- is the flip side happening, where you're getting some new signings because your competitors are distracted. So demand and maybe a little more color on where those signings are coming from? David Foss : Yeah, I know, the signings are coming again, record quarter, so they're coming from kind of the same place as we've always seen them. It would be hard for me to articulate an uptick in demand, because we've had such strong demand for the past, it's been since last June, I reported on the June, the call at the end of last June that we were at a record pipeline in the sales organization. And that has continued even with all these signings, the pipeline continues to be really strong. So it would be hard for me to say that I see some great big uptick coming, because we've been running at a really healthy pace here for quite some time. As far as competitors being distracted, I think it's early days and all of that to see, these are long decision making processes that our customers go through. And so, if there's distraction happening out there, that may come. I'd say we're all in the same competitive environment that we've been in for a long time, and I don't see any major changes right now. But obviously, that may change over time. Joseph Foresi : Got it. And the last question for me is just on margins, Kevin, any updates on what the short and long term margin outlook might be? And when we get some of the noise that we're currently seeing out of the numbers? Kevin Williams : Yeah, Joe, I mean, obviously Q4, the guidance is the margins are going to go down, even a little more than they were this quarter because of the tough comp for license and install invitation revenue, continued decrease in de-conversion fees, margins for next year, we're still trying to kind of line those out. So, I mean, margin can be down a little bit in Q4, and what I'm planning on doing is on our year end, just give you full guidance for next year, which will include revenue and margins. And I'm going to try to break down by quarter, which again with 606, is a little tough, but that is my commitment to you all is to give that guidance in mid-August when I give next year's guidance. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Heckmann from Davidson. Peter Heckmann : I wanted to talk a little bit more about the top line growth and acknowledging 5% adjusted growth and the impacts from either lack of implementation fees or deferral implementation fees, with five quarters of strong core signings and as well as complimentary signings, it seems like we should be getting adjusted revenue growth more towards the 7% to 9% range over the next four quarters. Can you talk us through like that change in the implementation fees and the deferrals, kind of quantify how much of that is impacting it. I mean, is that a 100 to 150 basis point impact? Kevin Williams : Well, I mean, Pete, just think about, I mean, just Q4, the tough comp compared to last year, just in in-house license and in-house implementation revenue is 5 million to 6 million. That drops to the bottom line pretty quick, which that has a pretty significant impact on margins. So as we ramp up the outsourcing and get more of our -- these new customers on, that doesn't provide any license revenue or immediate implementation revenue because the implementation revenue, those spread over the life of the contract, so it's just going to layer on slowly and give us nice growth.  So two things I\u2019d say. One, with the decrease de-conversion fees, which is obviously a bad thing this year, but that means we're continuing to keep that revenue. And as we layer on this additional revenue, I mean, it should pick up revenue growth a little bit. I don't know we're going to get up to your -- the high level of yours. But like I said, the original budgets for next year, we're very comfortable saying that we're going to continue in the 6% to 7% range. And, Pete, we've always tried to hit exactly ahead or be conservative. Peter Heckmann : And then can you just give us an update on some of the new products, digital account opening, some of the new things that you've been rolling out more recently and maybe just a bit of an update on success in the marketplace? David Foss : Sure. And I'll highlight some of these things next week at the Analyst Day in some detail, but continued to see great success with our digital platform. In fact, 27 new customer contracts in the quarter. So, really significant demand as far as digital is concerned. I already highlighted what's happening in payments. We now, on our treasury management platform, have 20 customers live on that platform. We signed five additional customers in the most recent quarter. So that continues to progress well. One that we've talked about a lot in the past, but haven't really focused on here on the call recently is our hosted Network Solutions offering where we're running the entire back office, including the network infrastructure for a customer. We now have 126 customers live on that platform. So continuing to see good success there. So those are just a few highlights. But like I say, next week, we'll go through a fair amount of detail on some of those new platforms. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Koning from Baird. David Koning : And congrats on all those core wins. That's impressive. I guess my first question is, it seems like with 606, there's been more lumpiness to revenue. You're still averaging that 6%, 7% just like you've been kind of doing for the last five, six years, but I think the first half of the year, this year, the organic core growth was kind of 7, 8, the back half, it seems like more like mid-single digits. Is there a new either seasonality that it creates or after we kind of anniversary this year, the next few years should just be kind of those -- a whole bunch of 7s in a row again, like we used to see. David Foss : Well, I think next year, Pete, there may still be a little more lumpiness. I think next year is going to be kind of the level setter. But there will still be larger growth, at least in Q1 because as we continue to sell more and more software subscriptions, that all gets recognized, basically the first day of the year, unlike it used to be. So as we sell software subscriptions through the year, all those now get recognized in Q1 under 606. But, and then you have the carve, which is basically throughout the year on each quarter, we have to go through and reanalyze our estimates on total contract value for all of our services yet to be provided and tweak those.  So there's going to be some ups and downs. So there's still some tweaking of that, which that had a small impact this quarter, will have an impact every quarter, and actually that impact was a little more positive in the first half than it is in the second half. So, long answer for a short question. But I think next year is kind of going to be the base. But I think as we go through the budget, we're going to be able to do a better job of predicting what that is. And hopefully, when I give guidance, in August, I can give you better quarterly guidance of what that's going to be to us. David Koning : Okay, so that's helpful. And, I guess, the other seasonality question, it looks like historically, if you excel term fees, Q1 historically has been a little better on the margin front. And then the, usually Q3, I think, has often been the low point for margins on, if you exclude term fees, you can see it a little clear is, is that just kind of the natural cadence and why is that again? David Foss : Well, I think, Q3 is partially because all the fringe load of taxes, every things kick in for [indiscernible] and everything starts over again. But there's just some other costs that kind of kick in back in in Q3 of our fiscal year that a lot of companies kick in their Q1. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brett Huff from Stephens. Brett Huff : Two questions for you. Dave, I know you're going to probably talk about this too from a product point of view, but one we've always been interested in that we don't talk as much about is your enterprise fraud solution. So could you give us a quick update on that? I mean, I know that was a really nice win on the partnership. And it sounds like it's \u2013 or at least based on conversation we've had, it's doing better maybe than some think? David Foss : Well, so yes, the partnership you're alluding to Brett is with SAS, so SAS of course known as the provider of enterprise risk solutions to the largest banks in the world, not just in the United States. That, as I disclosed early on, we didn't expect to sell this to every bank or credit union, this was something that was targeted at our larger customers. So we today have 15 customers live, we booked another new customer in the quarter. So it's progressing well. But again, I would emphasize, this is not a solution that we expect to sell to 2000 customers or anything like that. This was specifically targeted at our largest banks and credit unions, who had -- we're serving very broad markets, particularly commercial customers, and had a real need for significantly advanced fraud and analytics solutions in that area. Brett Huff : Second question is on the treasury management, it sounds like you guys are making good headway. I know, those are difficult deals to sell, they are big decisions for banks. And depending on who you talk to, there's some newer, newer products out there that are like yours, and there's some legacy products. How is that market dynamic or the competitive dynamic? I mean, is it still, are banks still frustrated with their choices? Or are they pleased that there's maybe some newer options or kind of where are we on that innovation curve on that market? David Foss : Yeah, it\u2019s a good question. The pretty consistent feedback that I get is, thank goodness that somebody has created a brand new ground up, modern solution to address treasury management, and that somebody being Jack Henry. So, we have a couple of competitors out there that have good solid solutions. But as far as I know, our treasury management solution is the newest to the market, it was written ground up to be a cloud native solution with mobile functionality.  And a lot of the legacy treasury solutions don't have good mobile functionality. In this day and age, if you're running a commercial business, you expect to be able to approve wires and so on through an easy mobile interface. So, it was written ground up to be cloud native, and with a nice, slick user experience and a slick mobile set of functionality. And so that's what's getting us the attention. But as you point out, it's a big decision to move to a new treasury management platform. I wouldn't put it in the same category as a core decision. But it's close because it has such a wide reaching impact on for a bank on your commercial customers.  And your commercial customers are, of course, the group of customers that you don't want to disrupt in any way, shape, or form. And so it's a big decision. But as I pointed out, we've had good success, we signed another five customers in the quarter. And so I expect that to be a winner for us going forward. And the key thing to remember there was the reason we did all of this was because we've continued to position ourselves as a provider for larger institutions. And if you're really going to be a solid provider for those larger institutions, having a tool like this is a real feather in our cap when we go into a large multi-billion dollar bank, and say, we have the suite that you need to run your bank effectively going forward. Kevin Williams : But what's really interesting is, as Dave said, we developed this thing, and we would only sell it to our largest customers. But we've actually sold it to some smaller customers and some really unique situations where one customer bought it for one customer. And then last week at our Symitar Strategic Initiatives, we actually had some interest in this from our credit union customers. Brett Huff : And then last question, this is a little bit more sort of blue sky. But one of the things we've been hearing or talking a lot about with clients and other industry participants is a lot more M&A going on, both in the bank world and I'm thinking BB&T and STI as the signature one. And then obviously, the core guys buying some merchant acquirers and payments businesses. But the underlying theme that we're hearing a lot is that scale matters, in particular, getting a bigger pot of money to spend more money on innovation in order to kind of stay ahead of the curve, both for banks, and for processors and technology vendors like you guys. I just wondered kind of where do you -- what's your take on that? Do we have enough money? Or how do we feel about our arsenal of money to develop things as quickly as we want? Or would we like to do it more quickly? And does that lead to partnerships or kind of give us a sense of where you are on that? David Foss : Well, I think your last point there is valid. So that is what has prompted a couple of the partnerships we've done recently. In the past, you didn't see Jack Henry doing partnerships very often. The partnership with SAS was a really unique opportunity. And it allowed us to not have to go and create that solution from the ground up as contrasted with treasury management, where we chose to do that as a ground up solution. So it's a question of prioritizing, regardless of size. It's a question of prioritizing and deciding what do you want to put your investment R&D dollars against and what are the things that maybe a partnership solves the problem as opposed to developing it yourself.  So it's the reason we ticked up our commitment to R&D a few years ago, it's the reason that we're running up the pace we are today with R&D, you've seen us roll out a number of new solutions in the past few years and that pace continues. So we're definitely committed to ongoing R&D, but it is a question of prioritizing and deciding what are the things we have to do ourselves, what are the things we don't have to do, because we don't have to be everything to everybody. And then one of the things where we can solve a problem by partnering with a really good solid partner. Kevin Williams : Yeah, I mean, our total R&D spend is about 14% of our total revenue. So we are reinvesting significantly. I'm not sure how much more we really need to do. So just that's, I think that's a good compare point. Operator : Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer for further remarks. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Justin. I want to remind everyone again that we're having our Annual Analysts Day next Monday afternoon in Denver, Colorado. We will have presentations by all of our executives, our officers and our general manager sales, and there will be related Q&A time for each one of those sessions. The entire session will be webcast, if you're not able to attend in person, but if you are there in person, you will be able to see some of our hotter products being demoed in the mini tech fair that evening after the final Q&A. Again, we're pleased with the overall results of our ongoing operations and the efforts of all of our associates to take care of our customers. Our executives, managers and all of our associates continue to focus on what is best for our customers and our shareholders. I want to thank you again for joining us today and Justin, with that, will you please provide the replay number? Operator : Thank you, sir.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management\u2019s prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session and our instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Brian. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry & Associates fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2019 earnings call. I\u2019m Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer. And on the call with me today is David Foss, President and CEO of Jack Henry. In just a minute I will turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the state of our business and performance for the quarter. And then, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market close. I will provide guidance for FY20. And then, we\u2019ll open the lines up for Q&A. First, I need to remind you that remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate, due to a number of risks and uncertainties, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday\u2019s press release and the sections in our form 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. With that I will now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We're once again pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth. As always, I\u2019d like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work that went into producing those results for our fourth quarter and for the entire fiscal year. As we\u2019ve discussed throughout the fiscal year, the changes associated with ASC 606 introduced some lumpiness in the financials for the year. But, if you look at our annualized numbers, we posted a very solid financial performance. For fiscal year 2019, revenue was up 6% and was up right in line with our guidance at 7%, if you account for the significant decline in deconversion fees in FY19 as compared to the prior year. The core segment of our business saw revenue increase of 5% for the year, as compared to fiscal year 2018, and an increase of 6%, if you exclude the impact of deconversion fees from both years. Our Payments segment performed well, posting an 8% increase in revenue for the year and a 9% increase excluding the impact of deconversion fees from both years. Our complementary solutions businesses posted a 6% increase in revenue in fiscal year \u201819 and a 7% increase excluding the impact of deconversion fees from both years. As I mentioned in the press release, our sales teams again had an extremely solid quarter in Q4. We booked 15 new core wins in the quarter with all of them as competitive core takeaways, bringing us to 57 new core clients signed in the fiscal year. Additionally, we booked 25 in-house outsourcing deals in the quarter, and we signed 17 new customers to our new debit processing solution. With all of that success though, the traction we\u2019re getting with our Banno Digital suite is possibly most notable. We signed 41 clients to the full suite in the quarter, bringing our total to 122 for the full year. The combined sales organization exceeded quota again this quarter and continues to manage a solid pipeline as we head into fiscal year \u201820. Jack Henry's full suite of modern, cloud-enabled solutions continue to position us well to win share in the market. Regarding our new debit and credit processing solution, we now have 509 customers live on the platform, including 44 debit customers installed as new rather than migrated. We also have 9 new credit customers live on the platform. We have now migrated more than half of our existing core customers, and we're still on track to complete our core customer migrations by the end of fiscal 2020. As we discussed on the last call, we expect our non-core clients will extend our migration date until November of 2020 because of the extra programming and testing effort for those non-core customers. On July 1st, we announced the acquisition of Geezeo, best-of-breed personal financial management and analytics company, based just outside of Boston. The deal happened just after the close of our fiscal year. So, it has no impact on FY19. It is a terrific, strategic acquisition for us to start the New Year. As you may have read, we've known the Geezeo team for many years and had recently partnered with them. So, we understand their technology well. They\u2019ve already done a good portion of the integration work required with our Banno Digital suite. So, we hit the ground running on this deal. This technology continues to move us forward toward our goal of offering the most robust, digital banking suite in the industry, including PFM, personal financial management, and deep analytics for the consumers who bank with our financial institutions. Overall, this was a very good year for our Company. Our employee engagement and customer satisfaction scores remained very high, our sales teams are performing extremely well and have positioned us for another successful year of selling, and overall demand for Jack Henry technology solutions remains very high in all segments of our business. As we begin the new fiscal year, I continue to be very optimistic about our future. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Dave. The service and support line of revenue increased 2% compared to the prior year\u2019s restated quarter -- prior year numbers are restated for ASC 606 and then, we have revenue recognition rules. Our license hardware and implementation revenues were down $5.2 million in the quarter compared to last year as we continue to have headwinds from decreased license and on-prem implementation revenue because of the fact that almost all of our new core installs are electing our private cloud model, which is good for us long term. Our outsourcing and cloud services were up nicely to offset the decrease in license hardware and implementation revenues, and our deconversion fees were up slightly compared to year ago. The processing line of revenue, which is all of our transaction, remittance, card and digital, grew 7% compared to prior year. Total revenues were up 4% for the quarter and up 6% for the year compared to last year, and on a non-GAAP basis, revenues were up 4% for the quarter and 7% for the year. Our reported consolidated operating margins were down from 22% last year to 20% this year, primarily due to three headwind impacts : First, the significant decrease in our license revenue this quarter, compared to a year ago as license revenue is our highest margin revenue; second is the additional cost of processing our debit card customers\u2019 transactions until we get them all migrated to the new platform; and then, third is the additional costs for the employee pay-for-performance plans that are being funded with a portion of the savings from the Tax Cuts and Job Act or the TCJA that we talked about at beginning of fiscal year. Our operating margins for the year were down from 24% last year to 22% this year for all the reasons just listed, plus the fact that our deconversion fees were down $15.9 million for the year compared to last year. So, all-in-all with all those headwinds, we feel very good about the operating margin we turned into the year. Our segments operating margins continue to be very solid with small fluctuations. However, payments segment will continue to have the increased margin headwind going forward as the additional cost continues to increase as we migrate our existing customer to the new payments platform. Our effective tax rate for the year was 23% this year compared to 19.6% last year. Remember, last year was low due to timing of tax benefits due to TCJA. For cash flow included in the total amortization, which is disclosed in the press release is the amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which increased to $20.8 million year-to-date this fiscal year compared to $18 million last year. Depreciation was up slightly for the quarter -- or down slightly for the quarter and non-acquisition amortization was up due to more of our internally developed products being put into production. Our operating cash flows were $431.1 million for the year, which was up 5% compared to last year, and we invested $176.8 million back into our Company through CapEx and developing products, which is up from $149.9 million a year ago with much of the increase in CapEx related to data center upgrades back in Q1 that we talked about on previous calls. Our free cash flow was $260.5 million or 96% conversion of net income for FY19. For FY20 guidance, as Dave mentioned, we're being very successful with core wins. But, out of the 57 new core wins this year, all but 4 have elected to go with our private cloud delivery model. And with continued migration of our existing in-house customers to our private clouds means continued decrease in license revenue and in-house segmentation revenue. In fact, we believe this could be a revenue headwind of roughly $15 million next year compared to the year just completed. Currently, we are projecting deconversion fee revenue to be flat to slightly up in FY20. However, revenue from all of our processing customers will continue to be -- grow very nicely. Therefore, our total revenue is projected to grow between 6.5% and 7% for FY20. With projected decrease, license revenue and additional cost headwinds from our payments platform migrations, we project operating income will grow approximately 5% on a GAAP basis and close to the 6% on a non-GAAP basis for FY20. We will continue to experience revenue and operating income fluctuations between our first quarter -- or fiscal quarters due to license implementation payment platform migrations and software subscription usage, which again is recognized in the first quarter of the year. Operating income and margins will be highest in Q1 due to the software subscription revenue, and then will drop off for the next three quarters, very similar to FY19 due to ASC 606. We anticipate operating margins for FY20 to be mostly in line with FY19 at approximately 22% for the year. Our effective tax rate for FY20 will be 23% to 23.5%, which is up from our actual effective tax rate of 21.7% for FY19 due to some state tax benefits and other benefits that we got this year from stock option restricted stock that we do not anticipate getting in FY20. Having said all that, our projected FY20 EPS is in the range of $3.60 to $3.64. And remember, due to software subscription revenue recognition is little frontend loaded, so EPS for Q1 FY20 should be in the range of a $1.02 to $1.05. Therefore, in summary, on a non-GAAP basis, revenue should grow 6.5% to 7%, operating will grow approximately 5.5% to 6%, and with the expected higher tax rate, our EPS for the year will be $3.60 to $3.64. As we discussed on the last call, we will not be finished with the migration to the new payment process platform by the end of June 20. As Dave mentioned, we're still on plan to have all of our core customers that we processed through debit [ph] and payments to be migrated by June 20 and all non-core customers to be moved by November 2020. However, these non-core customers are currently being processed on both platforms. And therefore, we will not be able to shut either platform down completely to recognize the significant reduction cost until the first half of 2021. We conservatively calculate a reduction of direct cost of revenue over $16 million once we get the migrations complete with approximately 30% of that savings that will be recognized by Q1 of FY21 and the balance of that savings will be recognized by Q3 of FY21. We also anticipate cap software to be up a little in FY20 compared to FY19. However, we expect CapEx to be down significantly from FY19, which means our total cap spend will be down to allow more leverage of net income to free cash flow in FY20 compared to FY19. This concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions. Brian, will you please open the lines for questions? Operator : Yes, sir. Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question will come from Vasu Govil with KBW. Your line is now open. Vasu Govil : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, just first on the deconversion fees, you\u2019re sort of calling them out to be flat next year. To the extent that deconversion fees are sort of seemed to be on a decline to flat trend, I\u2019m assuming that means lower attrition in the business. Does that start to help elevate the overall growth rate at some point versus the historical 6% to 7%? David Foss : This is Dave. I would say, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s going to accelerate significantly, and we have no control over deconversion fees. We talked about it on prior calls. So, that\u2019s all a function of when one of our customers is acquired by somebody else, another financial institutions, that\u2019s generally, when they end up paying deconversion fee. Now, if they\u2019re in-house, they may have no fees associated with that. But if they are a cloud hosted customer, that\u2019s when deconversion fees kick in. So, in theory, if there were no deconversion fees in the future and at the same time we\u2019re layering in new customers, then your point would be well made. But, I don't know that that's a reasonable expectation because there is -- there continues to be churn in the space, there continues to be mergers happening. And again, we have no way to predict accurately what might happen because it\u2019s just a function of when one of our customers decides they are going to sell their institution. So, I wouldn't be comfortable making that assumption because I think one of the underlying conditions there would be that the M&A would come to a stop and that just is not going to happen I think. We\u2019ve seen a pace of about 4% per year for the last 30 years, and I believe that's going to continue going forward. Kevin Williams : However, if deconversion fees are flat, that means we're not losing anymore customers that we lost this year. And based on our revenue models, which is based on asset size or number of accounts processed, then that should help to grow our businesses and not create a headwind. Vasu Govil : That\u2019s helpful. And then, just I guess another quick one. The second half seems to have been considerably stronger in terms of core singings that you\u2019ve announced. Anything you would attribute this strength to? I mean, are you seeing an uptick in the overall demand in the market as things catch up with the latest technology, or do you think you may also be benefiting from perhaps your competitors being distracted with integrations? David Foss : I think, it\u2019s too early to tie anything to our competitors being distracted. Although I certainly hope that they will be distracted going forward. I think, it really is a reflection of the recognition Jack Henry is getting. And this isn\u2019t new. I\u2019d say, over the past two years or three years now, I think the new technology solutions we\u2019ve rolled and the significant enhancements we\u2019ve made to our core solutions but then all of these other complementary solutions that we\u2019ve rolled out, including treasury management and the new digital platform and all that, when you combine all of that, Jack Henry is getting a lot of recognition in our space for having a leading technology. I think that's what's driving that. And of course signings, they kind of are little -- they tend to be a little bit lumpy. I\u2019ve said on many calls in the past, if you can do 10 new core signings in a quarter, that is very significant. We're on a pace here, this past quarter we did 15, the quarter before that we did 18. I mean, I don't see that slowing down. But again, the hurdle you should keep in mind is 10 is significant for a quarter. So, I guess, we see that continuing. Vasu Govil : Thank you very much. If I could squeeze in a quick one for Kevin. Kevin, for 2020 guidance, you said 6.5% to 7% revenue growth, but then you said operating income growth would be lower at 5.5% to 6% but margins would be flat. I just wanted to understand, if margins are flat, why operating income is not going in line with the revenue growth. Kevin Williams : Well, margins -- and that\u2019s on a non-GAAP basis; on a GAAP basis, margins will be down slightly. And that's what I said, our operating income will grow roughly 5%. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. David Togut : Were there any major themes in the 15 new core wins in the quarter in terms of size, the financial institution? You called out strength in treasury management, any other major takeaways from the wins from the quarter? David Foss : No, I don't know that there were any themes in the quarter. I mean, there were some nice size wins. We featured one. We featured Busey, for example, in a press release, a large multibillion dollar institution. So, I don't know that there any themes. The one thing that I would emphasize again, though, is this recognition we\u2019re getting for offering a very complete solution, particularly with the digital offering on the front end, I think a lot of core customers that we\u2019re talking to today are really recognizing that the Jack Henry Banno solution is an industry leading digital solution. And so, that is helping to influence some of these core decisions without any doubt. David Togut : Understood. And then, on the guidance, Kevin, you indicated 6.5% to 7% revenue growth for FY20. Could you give us an indication of how that breaks down by each of your three segments? Kevin Williams : The three segments, I mean, obviously, all three of them should grow nicely. I mean, core will be probably the biggest one, David. I mean, this is probably going to grow in the 8% because of all the outsourcing activity we had going on. Payments should continue to grow nicely in the 6% to 7% range, and complementary should be right there at the 5% to 6% range. So, it's kind of blend together. David Togut : And just a quick final question. You've indicated, Dave, that you have no need to really participate in industry consolidation, at least at the level that we've been seeing it this year. Any updated thoughts in that regard? And then, are there any impacts, let's say on sales cycles, closing rates? Obviously, it was a good quarter, but just maybe the tenor of conversations in the market as two of your major competitors have completed large acquisitions? David Foss : So, no update as far as any plans, the Jack Henry has to do \u201ctransformational acquisition\u201d, nothing changing there. And again, we don't have our head in the sand here. We're very aware of what's going on around this and very, very conscious of the decisions that are being made there. But, we don't see a need to do something, again, I use the word transformational pretty regularly. The topic certainly is coming up with prospects and customers out there. Generally, I would say the tenor is in the Jack Henry's favor. The fact that we're very focused on being a provider to banks and credit unions in the United States and offering best-of-breed technology solutions to those customers. So, I would say and again, it's early days, as I answered previously, I can't say there's traction going on with our competitors or anything like that. But, in early days, I would say the tone tends to be more favorable for Jack Henry, because we are so focused on our strategy, as opposed to any hand wringing about concerns about our strategy. Kevin Williams : And the other thing, David that\u2019s around there is obviously we have our annual education conferences in the fall, and our Symitar Educational Conference is next month, and we've already got record attendance signed up for it, and also record prospects that are signed up to come to that. It's little early to state what's going to happen at the Banking and ProfitStars conference. But I think that is a extremely good indication of all the activity we have coming to our education conference. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Peter Heckmann : Can you talk about, first, can you just go over for 2021, Kevin, your comments on the savings from eliminating the duplicate platforms and the number you provided as well as how you see that being realized over the first three quarters of the year? Kevin Williams : So, Pete, what I said was we\u2019re going to have -- right now, we've identified a little over $16 million of direct costs that will come out of the business. 30% of that will be recognized by Q1 of FY21, and the balance of that, the other 70% will be recognized by Q3 of that year. So, it's pretty easy to do the math. I mean, you're going to take out $4 million or so going into Q1 and you're going to take out the other $12 million or so going into Q3. So, we'll see the whole savings by Q3 of FY21. Peter Heckmann : Got it. Thank you. And then, can you talk about -- just really good activity on the new business side. Can you talk about your capacity for implementations and how the backlog for converting new business looks, is that getting extended at all? David Foss : The good news is, we're pretty flexible in our ability to absorb additional deals. We\u2019ve been running at a pace of pretty significant sales pace here for quite some time. And it's been kind of slowly but surely escalating. So, we've been able to staff appropriately. We've seen what -- I think, our sales team is doing excellent job of forecasting for the operation side of the business. So, we've been able to staff appropriately as we add these deals. So, there are couple of areas where there is maybe a little bit of a backlog pressure, sure. But, that's one of those things that you manage all the time in a business like this, trying to make sure that you don't over staff and figure out is that demand going to be continuing or is that just a blip. And I would say, today, our ability to manage the backlog is everything is in hand and we have no major concerns there. The other thing I\u2019ll point out, when it does come to us increasing staffing, we\u2019ve emphasized many times in the past the fact that Jack Henry is constantly winning these best place to work awards around the country. And the Glassdoor ratings that Jack Henry maintains really gives us a leg up when it comes to recruiting people in this essentially full employment environment that we live in today. We are having no challenges in recruiting because of that recognition. So, I'm very comfortable that we\u2019re in a position where we can maintain the backlog at appropriate rate, and deliver successfully for our customers. Peter Heckmann : Great. And just one more maintenance item, Kevin, implicit in your revenue guidance for the year, should we assume that Geezeo is going to contribute maybe $5 million to $10 million of revenue? Kevin Williams : Yes. Geezeo is going to contribute somewhere around $9 million fee and have virtually no impact on our operating income in FY20. Obviously, there is a lot of integration efforts to get that in line. So, there's not going to be a whole bunch of new revenue. However, I will say that having that and having that in our plan will help drive additional Banno sales. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Kartik Mehta : Hey. Good morning, Kevin and Dave. Kevin, I wanted to go back to the platforms savings you talked about. Is $16 million the total amount of savings you anticipate or is that just a first part and you\u2019re anticipating a lot more savings coming from platform consolidation? Kevin Williams : That $16 million is what we've identified at this point. Do we think there is some additional leverage and additional opportunities? Absolutely. That's what we've identified and that's what I\u2019m willing to state right now that will have an impact. Having said that, I mean, if I was able to take $16 million out right now, then, I\u2019d be projecting operating income growth of 10% next year instead of 5% roughly. So, it sounds like a small number but it\u2019s pretty significant. Kartik Mehta : Yes. I just wanted to make sure, obviously it sounds like there is other opportunities but this is what you\u2019re willing to commit to at this point in time. Is that fair? Kevin Williams : Yes. That\u2019s fair. Kartik Mehta : Okay. Hey, Dave, as you talk to your customers and the banks, considering what happens to the yield curve and maybe some of the net interest margin squeeze that they might -- are already seeing or anticipating, is that changing their behavior, or are you seeing any difference in conversations with them about spending on technology? David Foss : That\u2019s a good question, Kartik, and it\u2019s a logical question because you would expect that would be happening, but it's actually the opposite. There is so much enthusiasm out there right now as we talk to customers about first off what Jack Henry is doing, enabling them with technology, but secondly, about the opportunities for them to grow their institutions. And yesterday, an American banker, there was an article published about banker optimism, and they quoted a survey they had just recently completed, banker optimism at the end of Q2 was higher than it's been in more than two years, and they said it was up significantly in the quarter as compared to the prior quarter. And so, I'm not -- I don't exactly understand what's happening there. But, I believe it because that's what we experience in the conversations that we're having with prospects and customers. They're really still maintaining this optimistic view about the future and their ability to grow their institution. And certainly, our sales pipeline hasn't slowed down, even though we had a huge sales quarter in Q4. The pipeline continues to be very robust. And so, there is still this optimism out there that seems a little counterintuitive, but it's definitely there. Kartik Mehta : And, Kevin, could you -- would you be willing to put some dollars around your CapEx? You said, it will be down significantly in FY20 compared to FY19 if I heard that right. So, what's significant? Kevin Williams : Yes. I don't have that number right in front of me, Kartik. What I said was our total cash spend of cap software, internal software development in CapEx will all be down nicely next year compared to this year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of John Davis with Raymond James. Your line is open. John Davis : Kevin, you mentioned that the in-house to outsourcing trend is definitely beneficial long term. Do you have an idea or can help us conceptualize when that can flip from kind of being a revenue headwind to a revenue tailwind, understanding that obviously given the upfront implementation and license revenue, and return for revenue down the road, when you get a backlog, should like -- when you go to \u201821, is it possible that becomes a tailwind instead of a headwind or is that multiyear headwind? Kevin Williams : It's very possible, we could have it in \u201821, John. Because obviously we're -- as I said in my opening comments, we anticipate license and on-prem implementation to be down $15 million next year. And that's going to get down to a pretty low where it should not be much of a headwind anymore, and the fact that we have to defer the implementation revenues for all the outsourcing customers under the new rev rec rules, means that that will grow just like the outsourcing revenue grows and we'll get that get that implementation revenue growing as well. So, I'm not going to stand here and say it's going to be a huge driver, but it'll stop being a headwind and could actually help grow instead of go against us. John Davis : Okay. And then, I assume that would also help margins at the same time. Right? So, it would be -- there is some revenue headwind, it's also a margin headwind. So, that's going to be something out that would drive margins higher in \u201821 absent -- or outside of the payments platform winding down? Kevin Williams : Absolutely, John, because obviously our license revenue is essentially 100% margin. So, if we can get license revenue stop declining and just stay flat, then that in and of itself, will be a benefit for operating margins. John Davis : Okay. And then, Dave, I just wanted to touch on, you've been calling out for a few quarters now, how well Banno has been doing. Maybe just talk a little bit about why it's running in the market, what people love so much about it, and I guess why they're taking Jack Henry and that product specifically? That'd be helpful. David Foss : Sure. So, the thing I think Banno is getting recognized for most significantly is first off the user experience, the design of the platform, the design of user experience because again this is not only being used by people in the bank, but primarily being used by their consumers. So, design, the user experience, intuitive design, those types of things. Now, everybody says they have an intuitive design, but we are getting a lot of recognition from experts in the space. People who work at these banks and credit unions who have been hired as the chief digital officer, they area people that are recognizing Banno in particular as being a best-of-breed solution. Then, I think the most significant thing often times is the fact that we've tried to design the solution to enable our customers -- and remember, our customers, community banks and credit unions, their primary competitors are the tier 1 banks, the JPMorgan Chases and BoAs of the world. And so, we\u2019ve designed this system so to enable them to deliver the same level of service they are used to delivering when they are right across the teller line, but they can do it in a digital world. So, as opposed to pushing all the consumers away from ever interacting with a human, the Banno solution is designed, so that there is tools that the consumer can do things on their own if they want to, but if they want to engage with a human, the tools through that digital channels are designed to make it really easy for the consumer and really easy for the banker to assists their customer, a human touch that all credit unions and banks are known for -- community banks are known, a human touch but do it in the digital channel. That's where we\u2019re getting I think great recognition is the fact that we've married the value of the community banks and credit unions have always tried to bring to the market. We\u2019ve married that value with industry-leading digital experience for their consumers, and we\u2019re the only ones out there doing that. John Davis : Okay. And last one for me, just want to touch on capital allocation a little bit more specifically, M&A. Obviously, there\u2019s been a lot of chatter around B2B, payments and the ability for you to potentially buy something and push that through your banks. Is that something that\u2019s on your radar that you are looking at, is there anything else from M&A perspective? Getting your comments, there is nothing transformative being contemplated currently, but some smaller deals, anywhere that you think would make sense for some small tuck-in deals or comments on B2B? And then, finally, just how you guys think about buybacks here? Thanks. David Foss : Sure. So, nothing -- so, B2B is a great big topic. So, as far as merchant acquiring, are we planning to do a larger acquisition in merchant acquiring space. The answer would be no, that's not a part of the strategic plan right now. Are we involved in that space? Yes. Are we involved in the B2B space? Yes. We have -- through our EPS platform, we have over 0.5 million small businesses that we serve through our Enterprise Payment Solutions platform today. And we\u2019re continuing to add to the solution offering that we have there. We just don't feel that the merchant acquiring offering is the key to our success there. So, yes, we are continuing to add functionality. We\u2019re always looking at acquisitions, not just tuck-in acquisitions. Although we\u2019ve had great success with a lot of those, particularly smaller strategic deals like the Geezeo deal that we just did. But, we're always looking at potential acquisitions that would be additive to our suite, additive to the story for our customers, things that would help our customers and obviously our shareholders. So, we continue to be very active in the acquisition space as far as looking at potential deals. But, we don\u2019t feel the need to go do some very large acquisitions to become a merchant acquirer. John Davis : And I now assume, absent M&A deals being available or sizable, you guys will just continue to buy back stocks, given kind of where the balance sheet is today. David Foss : Yes. That\u2019s -- we\u2019ve discussed that many times, the fact that we always have acquisition at the top of the list. I think, we have a very solid acquisition theme. We know how to do acquisitions well. So, that\u2019s always a top of the list. But, then, we are opportunistic when it comes to share buyback as well. And we're committed to our dividend policy, of course. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Your line is now open. Brett Huff : One of my questions -- a question was asked earlier about bank -- Dave, you answered a question about bank enthusiasm. And I'm wondering if you're still seeing the same mix of -- is that revenue driven or cost driven or is it banks realizing that they have a tech deficit and need to catch up with maybe the fin-techs? Are you seeing -- first of all, what are the drivers of that enthusiasm, and then, has it changed much recently? David Foss : Yes. It\u2019s a good question. I wouldn't say that it has changed significantly recently. But, it has interesting. A lot of it is around finding tools that will help delivery efficiency within the institution. So, years ago, that was not -- was almost never on the list. And today, it's always one of the key topics as how do we improve our efficiency ratio within the institution, what are those tools that can help us when it comes to efficiency. The second driver is definitely around the topic of digital. And it's not just digital banking, as far as mobile banking and online banking, it's things like online loan origination, how do we get to commercial customers with an online experience, those types of things. So, that's been going on for a year or so. So, I wouldn't say that's a recent change, but it certainly is a driver that we have in place today that five years ago wasn't even a topic. Today, it's very much about enabling the digital experience for the customer, whether it's a commercial customer or a consumer, and then introducing efficiencies into the operation. And then, you mentioned the tech deficit. So, certainly, a lot of institutions feel like they've been in that space for a while now. So, they're trying to figure out how to improve their overall technology infrastructure. That helps us. But, I wouldn't say any of those are brand new in the quarter or even in the last six months. But, certainly, as compared to five years ago, it's a totally different environment. Brett Huff : And then, second one for me is, Kevin, thanks for the additional detail on the cost takeouts around the processing or the new card processing system. It's helpful. I wondered if you have any -- or willing to share with us any near or long-term outlook, your expectations around the revenue lift that you might get from that? I know, probably not from debit because you're sort of getting like-for-like, but what about the credit side? Is there -- have guys started sketching out what that might look like and would you want to give us any insight or is it a little too early? Kevin Williams : Well, Brett, I think it's still little early there. I mean, as Dave said, we\u2019re being very successful in signing new debit customers and new credit customers. So, we're going to get some nice lift. The fact is that credit card is still so new that I wouldn\u2019t say -- we've signed 17 new credit card customers and not all those are even implemented yet. So, I think, it's a little premature to do that, Brett. I mean, probably by our Q2 earnings call, we could probably give you a much better idea because we\u2019ll be way down the past migration, and have a much better idea of new implementations of both debit and credit. David Foss : The thing I will add to that Brett. So, we have 9 of those customers live now on the credit side. The thing that we're looking forward to is when we get to the point where we can start to sell both debit and credit outside our core base. Today, we're really focused inside the core base, because we need to get through these migrations and make sure we've got everything set. But then, when we hand this off as a ProfitStars offering to our ProfitStars sales teams to sell outside of the base, that opens up a lot of new prospects for this team and that will come sometime in -- not in fiscal \u201820; that will probably happen in fiscal \u201821. Kevin Williams : And just one more reminder that I\u2019d like to put out there, Brett. If you reminder, I mean, when we started down this path basically two years ago when we went with the build, buy or partner methodology, I mean, we did this, and the timing was because we were losing customers. And so, yes, we're going to have some nice uplift with the fact that were making this move actually stops us from losing customers and got rid of the headwinds. So, that's helping us right now in a large part. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Tim Willi : A couple of questions, first one is on the modeling side. Kevin, just thinking about the tax rate, which you called out as being a headwind for fiscal \u201820 versus \u201819, is this a good way to think about the steady state tax rate as we sort of start to think into the \u201821, \u201822 timeframe, or are there some variables out there around tax planning strategy, et cetera, that we can't really say that the tax rate you\u2019re guiding to right now is probably a reasonable one to use on an ongoing basis? Kevin Williams : No. I would say, Tim, the long-term 23% to 24% is the tax rate that you should be using from long-term modeling. Tim Willi : Okay, perfect. And then, a couple of follows-ups. Number one is the sort of the transition from software license into the cloud, et cetera. As you look at your current installed base, I guess, is there a way to think about maybe how much of that you have attributed that you\u2019ve addressed -- that is addressable? I\u2019m sure there would be some banks that are going to continue to do it the way they have. But, just in terms of thinking about how this headwind plays out, pretty much played through it with your installed base piece in-house to sort of outsource your cloud transitions? Kevin Williams : No. We have years of that movement to go yet. So, we\u2019re today around 60% -- 58% of our core base is installed in our cloud offering. And I\u2019ve said many times before, I don't see us getting to a 100%. You always have some banks and credit unions that want to remain in-house. But, we have years -- at the pace that we are going today, we have years yet of that type of movement, in-house customers moving to the cloud. So, we're definitely not at the end of that road. Tim Willi : Is the headwind probably as large as you\u2019d expect it to be, given that is still years to go on this transition, we shouldn\u2019t expect that to be bigger than it is right now, as you discussed the revenue outlook for this year versus prior years? Kevin Williams : I don\u2019t think the headwind is going to be bigger, Tim. In fact, I think it\u2019s going to be smaller, because as we continue to move more and more customers to outsourcing and we sell less licenses. So, I mean, if I license fees go down this year as much as we are projecting, then I don\u2019t think going down much more in \u201821 because some number of our customers, especially some of our larger banks and credit union customers are continuing to be in-house, they are going to buy license fees which is why our in-house maintenance, even though we\u2019ve had this significant shift from in-house [technical difficulty] our in-house support and services and our maintenance revenue continues to be very solid. In fact, we saw growth in that line again this year. And that headwind is more a function of us finding new customers who are not buying license this early, they are signing outsource customers, the move from in-house license -- somebody who is already a customer who is in-house moving to outsource environment, and that's all good news for Jack Henry right there, because most of those customers aren\u2019t buying a lot of new license anyway. Tim Willi : Okay. Thanks for the clarification. The last one I have is just around card, tied it bit to Brett\u2019s prior question. But, just thinking about what you are signing with new customers, and I guess even existing customers that are migrating to the new platforms. Is there any way to think about the wallet share, how robust the product set or the functionality is that they're signing up for? I know that was something you talked a lot about when you made this decision as the bells and the whistles and all the feature functionality you could bring to a card platform. So, just curious, you talked about a lot of wins, and a lot of new customers. Is the scope of the contract meeting or exceeding expectations? David Foss : Yes, definitely. So, when we talked about the -- having more opportunity for great wallet share, it was around the fact that because of the new platform we\u2019d have the ability to sell an enhanced rewards program, for example, enhanced analytics, reporting packages, those types of things. And I would say -- so, not only is that happening with new customers that we\u2019re signing, where they're signing up for most of those options, but the customers were migrating over from the existing platform are very often signing up for those new pieces of functionality that they didn't have before. So, keep in mind, we said when we announced this deal that an existing customer would transition to the new platform with the same pricing for the same function. But, our hope was, our expectation was that they would add functions which would add revenue, and that's definitely what we're seeing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. Joseph Foresi : Hi. Most of the questions that I had were answered. But, I do have a couple kind of just building off of a lot of the conversation. The first one is, I know you said that you're not going to see $16 million until sort of FY21. But, what does the cadence of margins look like this year? Are they going to -- because CapEx is going to go down, are they going to start to build towards the end of this year and then really start to accelerate in FY21, or are they going to stay flat and then we don't start to see it into FY21? I just want to get a sense of how you think about the margin cadence. Kevin Williams : So, Joe, I mean, it's -- because of what we're going through with the migrations, what you're going to see in FY20, as far as margins on a quarterly basis is going to be very similar to FY19. Margins are going to be very strong in Q1, because we're going to recognize all the annual software subscriptions revenues. In fact, we recognized those July 1, which -- obviously that's almost a 100% margins, because the software has been delivered. And then, margins will trail down from there as we continue to migrate our customers and the additional cost comes in. We will offset that some in the second half of \u201820 as we start doing some of the cost reductions in the second half. As I said, we will see at least 30% of that cost savings by Q1 of FY21. So, those savings will be coming out in the second half. The timing of that is not exactly not down but we know that's when it's going to come out. So, the margin will scroll down. And then therefore, going into FY21, you're going to see the margins really go up again in Q1 because again, a software subscription and the reduction of the cost that we take out in the second half of \u201820, the margins will go down a little bit in Q2 just like they have this year and next year, but then in Q3, you should see a really nice pop in margins, maybe 100 bps or so because of all the additional costs that come out in the second half of FY21. Joseph Foresi : Got it. So, it sounds like the back half of FY21 will really be when you start to see the acceleration on the margin side. David Foss : Q3 of \u201821 is when you should really see a lift in margins. Joseph Foresi : And then, just two others from a timing perspective, what does -- what could derail the plan that you've sort of laid out for us? And congratulations on the plan, because I know I've been asking you about it for about three or four quarters. But, what could derail that, or cause delays even further than what you've laid out? David Foss : We currently have more than half of our debit customers migrated over, Joe. So, everything is going according to plan. In fact, many of this week, we migrated I believe it\u2019s 25 or 26 more customers, and with zero issues by the time we got them all migrated. So, the plan is working exactly way it is. We are having no -- and remember, the reason we're doing the plan we\u2019re doing is because we did not have any impact on the end users and we've been extremely successful that -- because we\u2019ve had to not have to reissue any new cards or have been no new pins by the end users. And so the end users don\u2019t even know they\u2019ve gone through a migration. So, it\u2019s going extremely well. So, as far as the migration plan and in getting all of our core customers off by the end of June, I don't see hardly anything that could derail that. Obviously, there is -- we will be honest and come up and tell you what it is. But I don\u2019t see any out. The noncore customers, the only challenge there is we are relying on a third-party, to provide some of the programming and different things for us. But, I don't see that being a problem and it shouldn't be really at all. If anything, it could potentially cause a slight delay. But, I don't see anything derailing it. Joseph Foresi : And then, just the last one for me. On the top line, we've been in sort of this, I guess, mid to upper single-digit growth rate area code. But, if I heard everything correctly on the call, the pipeline is very strong. There's less conversion fees, which means that there are more people in-house. You're taking CapEx down, and you've done a reasonable amount of the migration. And your competition is absorbing very-large acquisitions. Plus, you said that there's been really no change in spending, if anything, an acceleration. So, as we look at FY20 heading into FY21, I think you can guess my question. What is that -- could there be a revenue growth acceleration? All the data points we seem to be hearing would be implying that that could take place. But, I wanted to of course put that question to you guys. Kevin Williams : So, Joe -- and let me answer this. Obviously, in this industry, when you start looking more to the year out, the crystal ball gets pretty cloudy in a hurry. But, as I said, so with the significant decline that we are projecting this year in license revenue, if that does as my crystal ball predicts, kind set a base line for us for license revenue going forward, with the -- once we get the migration complete and we continue to add new cards and we get to where we can sell as Dave mentioned earlier, so both debit and credit outside the base to non-core customers, I would say that you could see a lift in 2021 going out \u201820 in revenue. Is it going to be greater 10%? I don't think so. But, it could be higher than the 6.5% to 7% that we\u2019ve been running pretty steady at now for the last three or four years, and what we\u2019ve guided to do next year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is now open. Dave Koning : I guess, first of all, the cadence of revenue growth last year, I think went 8, 7, 5, 4 kind of through the year. And I know there were some 606 impacts and stuff. Is all that now kind of anniversaried, all that kind of turbulence in this year because of the way it all worked last year, the comps now are pretty normal, so that we get pretty similar growth rates for all quarters of this year? Kevin Williams : Well, you're still going to have a little more growth in Q1, because of all the software subscriptions that we sold in FY19. That revenue will all be recognized in Q1. So, you're still going to have a little faster growth in Q1 than you do the rest of years. Now, having said that, once you get past Q1, the revenue growth in Q2 through Q4 should be somewhat flat -- I mean, stable throughout the year. However, there is some timing limitations and timing is -- of license revenue recognition and different things, you\u2019re still going to have some lumpiness. But, it should be pretty stable once you get past Q1. Dave Koning : And was the 6.5% to 7% growth, was that like just GAAP revenue growth or was that\u2026 Kevin Williams : Yes. That\u2019s GAAP. Dave Koning : Okay. That's GAAP. Okay. On the margin side, I look back a couple years, I think you did -- in fiscal \u201818, you did about 22% adjusted margins, meaning adjusting out term fees and stuff. And this year, it looks like 21 or a little under 21. But, if you just fully add back this year, the $16 million of spending, you\u2019d get back to around what the level was in \u201818. But why wouldn't core margins be up, like why are they only flat? Is it literally just that license revenue has continued to come down and your core margins... Kevin Williams : Yes. Dave Koning : Okay. So, that's the only big reason? Kevin Williams : It's all driven by the shift and what revenue you're really recognizing. So, when you take license down at 100%, and even though your payments margins are nice margins, they're nowhere near 100% margins. So, it's a trade off of the type of revenue that you're recognizing. Dave Koning : Okay. And then, finally, I know 2021 doesn't get the full $16 million benefit, but if it did, that's about a 100 basis-point annualized tailwind. So, would it be fair to say 2021, if you've got that full benefit, you get 100 bps from that and then it is 50 basis points core margin expansion, kind of normal, so it would be up 150 in like a kind of normalized type year? Kevin Williams : As long as I know -- I'm going to say, yes, but I'm going to qualify that by saying as long as we don't see another significant decrease in license revenue in \u201821, compared to what we think we're going to see in \u201820. Dave Koning : Okay. And is 50 bps would be kind of a normal -- like, I know there's all the moving parts from term fees, implementation, but should we think longer term 50 would be pretty normal? Kevin Williams : Yes. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-answer-session for today. So, now, it is my pleasure to turn the conference back over to Mr. Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer, for any closing comments or remarks. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Brian. Again, we want to thank you all for joining us today for our year-end and fiscal Q4 earnings call. We're pleased with the results from our ongoing operations and the efforts of all of our employees, associates to take care of our customers. Our executives, managers, and all of our associates continue to focus on what is best for our customers and our shareholders. Again, thank you for joining us today. And Brian, will you please provide the replay number? Operator : Yes, sir. A replay of this conference will be provided following the conclusion of this call. To dial out and access this number toll free, you may dial 800-585-8367 and the total number is 404-537-3406. Again, those numbers are 800-585-8367 and 404-537-3406. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude our program and we may all disconnect. Everybody, have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Williams. Please go ahead. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Whitney. Good morning. Thank you all for joining us for the Jack and Associates first quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings call. I am Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer and on the call with me today is David Foss, our President and CEO. In just a minute, I will turn the call over to David to provide some of his thoughts about the state of our business and the performance for the quarter and then I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market close, update our guidance for FY \u201820 and then we will open the lines up for Q&A. First, I need to remind you that remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements or deal with expectations about the future. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties. And the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday\u2019s press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and forward-looking statements. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter with record revenue and earnings. As always, I\u2019d like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work that went into producing those results for our first fiscal quarter. For Q1 of fiscal 2020, total revenue increased 12% for the quarter and increased 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were up about $7 million over the prior year quarter, which accounts for a portion of the significant revenue increase over last year. But even excluding deconversion fees, this was a very strong quarter. As a reminder, we generally receive deconversion fees when one of our clients with a long-term contract in place is acquired by another institution and buys out the remaining obligation in their agreement. Turning to the segments, we again had an extremely solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 12% for the quarter and increased by 10% on a non-GAAP basis. Our Payments segment also performed very well, posting a 12% increase in revenue this quarter and a 10% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with an 11% increase in revenue this quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis. Our sales teams again had a solid quarter with two of our three brands exceeding their sales quota. We booked 5 competitive core takeaways and 5 deals to move existing in-house customers to our private cloud environment. We also saw very strong bookings in our payments and complementary solutions segments. Several of our newer solutions, including our Banno digital suite, our new card processing solution and treasury management saw strong demand. Regarding our new debit and credit processing solution, we now have 604 customers live on the new platform. This count includes 63 customers installed as new debit clients rather than as migrations and 11 new full-service credit clients. We have approximately 370 of our debit clients yet to migrate, but we have hit a comfortable stride now and our program continues to progress very well. As we did last year, we will suspend our migrations during the holidays because banks and credit unions don\u2019t like to implement changes to their card programs during this high volume time of the year. We expect to start the next large waves of migrations in January and remain on track to complete the migration process during calendar 2020. You probably noticed that we distributed a press release last week in coordination with the clearinghouse, announcing our plans to bring 15 clients live with the real-time payments network in the near future. We currently have 47 clients signed to implement Zelle and 15 clients ready to implement with the clearinghouse. I am very happy with the approach our team has taken in this regard because our PayCenter solution allows us to connect clients to the real-time payments network in groups rather than one at a time. Additionally, we provide connectivity through this single platform to multiple providers, which facilitates a more logical and efficient approach for our clients than any other processor in the market today. Since our last earnings call, we have completed our two largest client conferences of the year, our SEC conference for our Symitar core clients and our JAC conference for our Jack Henry Banking and ProfitStars clients. We had many prospects at each conference. And as I mentioned in the press release, our customers continue to be happy with our performance and extremely engaged with our prospective clients. Additionally, they continue to be optimistic about the coming year and their prospects for success. In addition to all the exciting developments with sales in our newer product offerings, you should also note that we\u2019ve announced a few organizational changes recently. Several weeks ago, Mark Forbis, our long time Chief Technology Officer, announced publicly that he will retire effective on November 15. Mark and I have been working for some time with Ted Bilke, our current Symitar President, to position Ted to move away from the day-to-day responsibilities running our credit union division and back to his technical roots in the technology area. Ted will assume the role of Chief Technology Officer upon Mark\u2019s departure. Shanon McLachlan, a well-known industry veteran and a current member of the Jack Henry leadership team, will move into the role as President of Symitar. Unrelated to the move with Mark and Ted, I announced that we\u2019re promoting Greg Adelson to become our new Chief Operating Officer. Greg and I have been working on positioning him to make this transition for many months. Greg has demonstrated outstanding leadership qualities and an ability to handle more responsibility, so he will be leading the primary operating units of our company going forward as a direct report to me. Of course, I am sad to see Mark leave. But if anyone has earned the right to kick back and relax a bit, it\u2019s Mark. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to him for his years of service and congratulations to Ted, Greg and Shanon as they move into their new roles. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Dave. The services and support line of revenue increased 13% compared to the prior year with license, hardware and implementation revenues up a little this quarter, but it was really due to some nice hardware deliveries during the quarter, which obviously has lower margins than license and implementation. We continue to have headwinds from decreased license and on-prem implementation revenue due to almost all of our core installs electing our private cloud model, which is actually good for us and our shareholders long-term. Our outsourcing and cloud services were up nicely again this quarter at an increase of 12% compared to last year. However, as Dave mentioned, deconversion fees were up $7 million compared to a year ago, but we still had nice overall growth considering that. The processing line of revenue, which is all transaction, remittance, card and digital grew 9% compared to the prior year. Total revenue up 12%, and on a non-GAAP basis, excluding deconversion fees and the impact of acquisitions was up 9% for the quarter. Our reported consolidated operating margins were up from 26% last year to 27% this year due primarily to the increased deconversion fees. And on a non-GAAP basis, our margins were flat with last year\u2019s first quarter of just under 25%. We will continue to see some operating margin headwind this year coming from continued decrease in license revenue as almost all of our new customers elect to go into our private cloud. And just a reminder, license revenue is our highest margin deliverable. Also, the additional cost of processing our debit card customers transactions until we can get them all migrated to the new platform and eliminate a lot of the additional costs that we have in processing. Our segments\u2019 operating margins continue to be extremely solid with small fluctuations. Our Payments segment will continue to have increased margin headwind going forward, again, as the additional cost continues to increase as we migrate our existing customers to the new payment platform. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.6% this year compared to 19.2% last year, which the entire difference in these two rates was related to stock-based compensation deductions that we had last year, but we did not get the same impact in this year\u2019s first quarter. For cash flow, included in total amortization, which was disclosed in the press release yesterday, amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions increased to $5.5 million this year-to-date compared to $5.1 million last year. Depreciation was also up for the quarter, primarily due to the data center CapEx we did in Q1 last year, which is now all in production. And non-acquisition amortization was up due to more of our internally developed products and software being placed into production. Our operating cash flow was $123.1 million for the quarter, which is down compared to last year. But this as explained, was all due to timing of working cap items. First, AR was up quite a bit and offset a little bit by deferred revenue, which is caused by the shift from our in-house customers outsourcing, so we have more monthly billings than we have historically. That\u2019s going to continue to shift. But the biggest difference here was, last year we did not pay Q1 dividends in Q1. We actually paid those on October 1. So our accruals were about $30 million higher last year because of the accrued dividends. So if you take that out, our operating cash flow would have actually been up from last year and so would have free cash flow. So by the end of next quarter, that should all balance out and would be back to a nice conversion of net income to free cash flow. During the quarter, we invested $44 million back into our company through CapEx and developing products, which is down from $52.3 million a year ago, with much of that decrease\u2019s CapEx related to the data center upgrades in Q1 last year. So now we will update guidance for FY \u201820. Currently we are projecting deconversion revenue to be up slightly in FY \u201820. But again, those are totally unknown. It depends on when the dates are when they actually deconvert and we get the check. And we have no control or very little control over the timing of that. Revenue from all processing customers will continue to grow nicely. Therefore, total GAAP revenue continues to be projected to grow at around or slightly above 7% in FY \u201820. With projected decreased license revenue and additional cost headwinds from our payments platform migration, we project operating income will grow a little above 6% on a GAAP basis and around 5% to 5.5% on a non-GAAP basis. We will continue to experience revenue and operating income fluctuations between our fiscal quarters due to license, implementation, payment platform migrations and software subscription usage. Operating income and margins were the highest in Q1 due to software subscription revenue being recognized and then will drop off for the next 3 quarters very similar to FY \u201819. And all this is due to the new ASC 606 revenue recognition rules that were put in place last year. We anticipate GAAP operating margins for the year to be mostly in line with FY \u201819 at approximately 22% for the year as we feel like we can get some margin improvements to help offset the margin headwinds of the migrations. Our effective tax rate for the year will be 23% to 23.5%. We project Q2 EPS to be in the $0.88 to $0.92 range, and our projected full year FY \u201820 EPS continues to be in the range of $3.60 to $3.64. Therefore, in summary, on a non-GAAP basis, revenue should grow approximately 7%, operating income will grow in the 5% to 6% range and EPS for the year will be in the range of $3.60 to $3.64, pretty much in line with consensus estimates today. As Dave mentioned, we are still on plan to have all of our core customers that we process for debit payments on our systems to be migrated by June 2020 and all non-core customers to be moved by November 2020. There have been no change in these plans. We are on course to get that done. And therefore, there are no changes to the reduction cost or timing of cost reductions from what we provided on the last call. This concludes our opening comments. And with that, we are now ready to take questions. Whitney, will you please open the lines up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Peter Heckmann. Peter Heckmann : Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you talk a little bit about your implementation capacity? Any change in the relative timing of the backlog or some of these new core implementations? David Foss : Pete, no, I wouldn\u2019t say there is any significant change. We added a team last year. I think it was for to help customers, our core customers who are acquiring other institutions because there was a good bit of volume last year as far as our customers adding banks on the banking side, not on the credit union side but on the banking side. So we did add a team last year. We have not added any teams this year don\u2019t have a need for that. And we are managing the backlog well. We\u2019ve been running at a pretty consistent pace as far as core conversions for quite some time on the banking side. On the credit union side, we did recently add a team to help with in-house customers migrating to the private cloud environment and they can also help with new core customers that are coming into the private cloud environment. So we did add a team recently on the credit union side, but we are \u2013 and we are positioned well to manage that backlog and don\u2019t see a push there right now. Peter Heckmann : Good. Good to hear. And then as you have gotten continued success with the credit issuing product, 11 live, can you talk about your backlog there? And then talk about of your core customers, what percentage of those would \u2013 are currently in that market or would be interested in the credit issuing product? David Foss : Yes. So we don\u2019t have a huge backlog on the credit side. We have been managing that as we go here, so we have several that are in the queue. But the challenge for both new debit and credit deals is virtually any bank or credit union is in a long-term agreement today if their debit \u2013 almost everybody has debit, so they have a long-term debit contract. Those that are in credit programs have some kind of a long-term credit program if they are in the \u2013 if they are offering those services already. So there is a timing issue there with almost every customer where you have to work it out to make sure that your deal kicks in when their existing agreement is up for renewal. On the credit side, as we talked about on previous calls, there are a number of customers out there however who don\u2019t have their own credit portfolios. And so those customers, it\u2019s a matter of working with them to determine whether or not they want to get into the credit business. We saw a lot of demand a couple, 3 years ago. That\u2019s why we decided \u2013 that\u2019s part of the reason why we decided to do this deal that we have recently rolled out. But for those customers that don\u2019t currently have a credit offering, they have to go through the process of justifying it and make sure they have the internal staff to manage the program. So we\u2019re working both sides of that coin, with customers who are looking to move and those who are looking to start or bring their program in-house but not a current backlog concern, I would say, I don\u2019t know what percentage of our customers are active with us right now, but we have a number of deals in the sales pipeline right now for both debit and credit. Kevin Williams : And Pete, this is also kind of a slow roll because obviously, our focus was to get all of our debit customers migrate over to the new platform. That was we want to make sure that plan was solid in place. So we met our obligations to our customers and to our shareholders and then also with this credit card offering being a new offering, you kind of have to prove yourself. And now that we have 11 live, we have got referenceable customers and it makes a whole lot easier to sign additional customers when you have referenceable customers. David Foss : Just to give you a feel, so we signed 16 new debit customers just in this quarter. There is continuing to be interest and demand. And those are not aggravations. So those are people who have not done debit with us in the past that signed in the quarter. Peter Heckmann : Right. Okay, thank you. David Foss : Thanks, Pete. Operator : Your next question is from David Togut. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thank you. Good morning. John on behalf of David Togut. So the first question is, in the September quarter, research and development only grew 2% year-over-year compared to 9% organic revenue growth, excluding contracted conversion fees. Were there any unusual factors slowing the rate of R&D growth that will persist through FY 2020? For example, what was the year-over-year growth in software capitalization during the September quarter? For FY 2020, what are you budgeting for R&D growth on the income statement? Kevin Williams : So we are \u2013 and obviously, we don\u2019t disclose our budget. But our R&D is going to stay pretty much in line with total revenue percentage as it has in prior years. From quarter-to-quarter, what you are going to see is some flopping around because as we roll major projects that are in development being capitalized and we roll those projects off or into production, then R&D expense will go up in that quarter or could be \u2013 a lot of these products, we actually have contractors come in to do a lot of work for us and the retiming of shifting between development of different products. So you really can\u2019t base R&D expense growth on a given quarter. You almost have to look at the trailing 12 months to get a real feel for it. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And second question is, among the new contract wins for the September quarter, what were the top three drivers of new bookings growth from a product standpoint? David Foss : Are you talking about for core customers who signed, what drove that or are you talking about which products signed with core customers? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. David Foss : Yes. Generally, the core customer signings are \u2013 first off, they are looking for a new technology solution provider. They are probably running on an old core solution with whoever their provider is today. So they are looking for new technology. Secondly, oftentimes, they will say to us that the relationship is broken with whoever it is that they are working with currently. And so \u2013 and that encompasses customer service and then encompasses just the overall confidence in the direction of that organization or that product. And then thirdly, the digital strategy is becoming a big part of the conversation with almost every new core customer. And so we get a lot of great feedback from prospects about the digital strategy that Jack Henry has in place. You have seen us do a good bit of investment in the past few years, not only in our Banno digital platform. But when we acquired BOLTS and we acquired Geezeo, those were both acquisitions to help round out that digital strategy, that digital story. I have talked about it on several calls in the past. Jack Henry today is live with innovative technology as far as digital banking that nobody else in our space is doing and we are getting a lot of recognition for that. And that helps win core deals because every customer, every bank and credit union out there knows that for them to be successful in the future, they have to have a really solid digital experience for their customers. Kevin Williams : Yes. And as Dave mentioned in his opening comments, we are a little different because we had a number of core prospects at both of our national education conferences, and we literally turn those prospects loose. They go to any track, meaning breakout session. They can talk to any customers. And we even had a special breakout. We invited the industry consultants to come into our JAC and actually had a separate track for them, a separate 4-day track to help them understand better who we are and how we approach parts of the world. So I think all of those helped contribute to establish our culture and how we take care of our customers and that we are just a little bit different. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Kartik Mehta. Kartik Mehta : Hey, good morning Kevin and Dave. I looked at your revenue growth and the revenue growth was excellent this quarter. And Kevin, your guidance, still you are looking for around 7% revenue growth. And Dave, I was wondering, how much of that do you think is just strength in the marketplace and bank spending versus Jack Henry taking market share? David Foss : That\u2019s a good question, Kartik, because I think, as you know, for Jack Henry, it\u2019s both. We are certainly taking share. We have talked about it many times in the past. On the core side, we are taking share. And when we do lose a customer to acquisition normally, it\u2019s a smaller customer. So if you compare the ones we are taking on as compared to the ones that we lose because they have been acquired, the ratio is in Jack Henry\u2019s favor significantly. So not only are we taking share, but there is this continued focus on spending in our space, a lot of it around digital, which I just emphasized, a lot of it around people kind of repositioning their payments infrastructure to make sure that they can facilitate the needs of their customers going forward and then just looking for solutions that help them with efficiency, so any mobile-first and efficiency are big topics for our customers. So, it really is a combination of the two. The easy answer for me would be to say 50-50, half of it is us taking share, half of it is the fact that there is so much continued good news in the market. But I would say it\u2019s more heavily weighted toward us taking share, because when we win a core customer, they tend to surround that with a lot of other Jack Henry products. And as I mentioned earlier, when we are taking share, we tend to take larger customers than those that are being acquired out from under us. Kevin Williams : And I would also add, Kartik, I mean with us being at 85% or 86% recurring revenue, I mean, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to have just adding on a whole brand new bunch of customers because we have to add the same number of customers this quarter that we did a year ago just to maintain growth. So the growth is really all the cross-sell of all products that we\u2019ve rolled out. As Dave mentioned, the 60 plus new debit card customers that are on the system, the 11 new credit card, that\u2019s all new revenue growth, all the Banno platform customers that we\u2019re selling. The treasury management customers, I mean, there is just an enormous amount of cross-sell, which now we are starting to reap the rewards of \u2013 the fruits of our labor of the cap software that we have been doing for the last 4 or 5 years as these new products are really starting to get traction. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to \u2013 you are going to see continue to help drive revenue growth as we layer that revenue on top. Kartik Mehta : And then Kevin, just as an add-on to that, yes, if you look at \u2013 I know you said a long time ago to give a backlog number and that became a little bit more difficult. But kind of as you look at your backlog or implementation schedules, what kind of revenue visibility do you have? I realize 85% recurring, but you still have that other 15% to kind of add, so I am just wondering, how far you are seeing visibility for your revenue? Kevin Williams : Well, so Kartik, I mean, we\u2019ve got installed backlog on the vast majority of our products. So we \u2013 and most of those go 12 months out or longer. So going into a given quarter, we\u2019re 98% visible on what that quarter is going to be for revenue. I mean, obviously, you can have some fluctuations, you can have transaction changes within the debit cards or different things or you could actually have a customer delay a delivery, which under the new rev rec rules, if that happens \u2013 to delay a final conversion, then that could push all the software recognition and implementation revenues out into the next quarter. So you\u2019re going to still have a little lumpiness there. We have 98% plus in any given quarter. And it\u2019s not far from that, going into a given year any more, Kartik. I mean, with all of the backlog that we have and again, 85% recurring revenue, we\u2019ve got a lot of visibility. It\u2019s a whole lot easier to forecast and give guidance than it was 10 years ago. I can assure you that. Kartik Mehta : Well, thank you, guys. I really appreciate it. David Foss : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from John Davis. John Davis : Kevin just wanted to dig in a little bit on the EPS guide. I guess, I was a little bit surprised not to see you flow through the \u2013 at least the upside from deconversion fees into the full year guide. Is that just conservatism given it\u2019s the first quarter of the year or are there any kind of offsets that we\u2019re not thinking about? And then also, just how should we think about the cadence of revenue growth obviously, really strong in the first quarter, similar to last year. Should we see a similar cadence in revenue growth as we did last year to kind of decelerate throughout the year? Kevin Williams : Yes. I mean, it\u2019s going to \u2013 sorry, a little bit through the year because of all the software subscription and everything we take in the first quarter. But the other thing, John, is there is an actually \u2013 some of that deconversion revenue that got pulled in from Q2 that we thought was going to happen in Q2 actually happened in Q1. So we think \u2013 so I\u2019m not sure exactly where deconversion fees is going to fall out for the quarter, next quarter or the year, to be quite honest. So is there a little conservatism built into that guidance? Absolutely, I mean, I have been doing this a long time. I would much rather under-promise and over-deliver than the other way around. John Davis : No, that makes sense. And then Dave just obviously, the accounting changes we have now lapped. So the 11% core growth ex deconversion fees I think was probably better than most people expected, if not everyone. Maybe just talk about what\u2019s driving that? Obviously, you talked a little bit about the market share gains. Is that the result of kind of the last year plus of record new wins and we are finally starting to see that hit the revenue? And just trying to understand why that was outside of subscription would start decelerating throughout the rest of the year for the core business specifically? David Foss : You have nailed it right there. That\u2019s exactly it. So we have talked about it before on the call. When we sign a customer, it\u2019s generally 9 to 12 months before you start to see that revenue coming in on the core side because there is a lot of work that goes into preparing for that conversion. And once you lay that customer in, again, almost every customer we sign these days is signed as a private cloud-hosted customer. So once you start to layer that revenue in, then it starts to continue to be additive to the numbers you have seen in the past. And so for this quarter, this is a quarter that reflects not only bank customers that we have added in from last year, but now credit union customers that are being added in more on the private cloud side than in-house. Whereas in the past, we would sign them usually as an in-house customer, you would see the revenue path more quickly because we were selling a license fee rather than the hosting model. But now most of the credit unions we sign are also on the hosted model. So once you get them layered in, that revenue just starts to build. And you\u2019re really seeing that result now in this quarter strong. Kevin Williams : Okay. And John, let me just \u2013 I mean and I know you are familiar with it. The revenue build slide that I\u2019ve got in my investor presentation a few years ago. That slide has not changed. And so if you think about it, our outsourcing of cloud, just like that slide shows, is about 25% or 26% of revenue. It is continuously growing at a roughly 12% rate. That\u2019s what it\u2019s done on average for the last 3 or 4 years. I don\u2019t see that changing. You got our payments business, which is basically 35% of revenue that\u2019s grown in the \u2013 it\u2019s 7% or 8% this year. I think that could accelerate. So you\u2019ve got 60% of your business, which is all very nice margin business that\u2019s growing basically double digits. So you cross-sell some additional products and add on some additional products, it\u2019s pretty easy to get to that 7% to 8% growth that we have been guiding to. John Davis : Okay. And then last one for me, Dave, maybe just talk a little bit about the macro backdrop, both from a bank tech spending, any impact or change in behavior from \u2013 now that we have kind of had a few months and I think lower rates have kind of set into people\u2019s mindsets. Have you seen any impact there? And then also, any noticeable change in competitive landscape, good or bad, I would assume it\u2019s probably potentially a positive from the recent kind of big deals now that those are closed and some of your peers are in integration mode with these bigger deals? David Foss : Sure. So first off, for the first part of your question, and I mentioned it briefly in my opening comments. One of the good bellwethers for us is every year in the fall when we host our Symitar client conference and our JAC conference, which is banks and credit unions, at both conferences, I host a CEO breakout. So only CEOs and Presidents are invited to a 2-day session where we kind of talk about what\u2019s going on in the industry and we get a good opportunity one-on-one to get feedback from them regarding what they are seeing and how they are feeling and so on. And it was very uplifting coming out of both of those conferences how \u2013 there\u2019s no hand wringing. There\u2019s no major concern that the banking industry is in trouble or anything like that or a recession is on the horizon. In fact, it was the opposite, a lot of interest in new technology solutions. What can we do to either improve the end customer experience or introduce efficiency into the bank or credit union. So I don\u2019t see any slowdown as far as interest in technology, Jack Henry Technology solutions or their willingness to spend for those things that can help the institutions, so nothing changing there, still very solid. As far as the competitive environment, yes, you\u2019re right, major acquisitions have been happening in our space, nothing significant changing as far as the competitive environment for us on a day-to-day basis. In fact, several of you have speculated on this call in the past about will this create opportunities for Jack Henry in the long term. I\u2019m still not ready to say that, but it\u2019s feeling that way. There are a number of customers out there, prospects who were at our client conferences this fall that we mentioned earlier, who are expressing that they\u2019re interested in Jack Henry because they can see that we\u2019re very focused on them as banks and credit unions, providing outstanding technology solutions to banks and credit unions and ensuring that their underlying core infrastructure is solid and best-of-breed. So as far as the competitive environment, no negatives for us so far, but it\u2019s early days since these major acquisitions and we will continue to keep an eye on it. John Davis : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions] At this time, there are no further questions. David Foss : Thanks, Whitney. We are pleased with the results from our ongoing operations and efforts of all of our associates to take care of our customers. Our executive managers and all of our associates continue to focus on what is best for our customers and shareholders. With that, I want to thank you again for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] Pleased be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Williams, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Williams : Thank you, Sherrie. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the Jack and Associates second quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings call. I\u2019m Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer and on the call with me today is David Foss, our President and CEO. In just a minute, I will turn the call over to David to provide some of his thoughts about the state of our business and performance for the quarter and then I will follow that up with some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market close and then I will also provide some updated guidance for FY20 and then we will open the lines up for Q&A. First, I need to remind you this call includes certain Forward-Looking Statements including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these Risk Factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday\u2019s press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and forward-looking statements. Also on this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliation for historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found also in yesterday's press release. I will now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter with strong revenue and earnings growth. As always, I would like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work that went into producing those results for our second fiscal quarter. For Q2 of fiscal 2020 total revenue increased 9% for the quarter and increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. The conversion fees were up about $1 million over the prior year quarter, so although that variance contributed to our overall revenue performance, it wasn't the explanation for this very strong quarter. Turning to the segments, we again had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 7% for the quarter and increased by 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segments also performed well posting a 10% increase in revenue this quarter on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We also had a strong quarter in our complimentary solutions businesses with a 10% increase in revenue this quarter and an 8% increase on an non-GAAP basis. As I mentioned in the press release, our sales teams again had a very solid quarter and total sales bookings are now running 18% ahead of last year's record pace. In the second fiscal quarter, we booked 17 competitive core takeaways and 20 deals to move existing in-house customers to our private cloud environment. We also saw very strong bookings and our payments and complimentary solution segments. We signed 30 new clients to our new debit card processing solution and three new clients on the credit card side of the business. All of those 33 card contracts and 17 competitive core takeaways represent new revenue to Jack Henry. Our banner digital platform also experienced very strong demand with 25 new clients signing for the full digital suite. As you may have noticed, we published a press release last Thursday regarding the availability of our new JHA bank anywhere solution. I'm happy to announce that we currently have four banks in live production on bank anywhere and have several more in the queue to be installed. This solution is a cloud based core and digital banking solution offered to digital only banks. It leverages the complete set of open APIs built by our - team to enable easy connectivity to the core and other complimentary functions. If the digital bank is our new charter, we can provide the core and the API connectivity they need to integrate solutions from virtually any Fintech provider. If the digital bank is an offshoot of a traditional brick and mortar institution, we can deploy bank anywhere regardless of the core system that traditional bank is running. This solution is just another example of the many innovative technology solutions being offered today by Jack Henry to help our banking clients compete in the digital world. Regarding our new debit and credit processing solution, we now have well over 600 customers live on the new platform. This count includes 73 customers installed as new debit clients rather than as migrations and 13 new full service credit clients now live on the platform. We have approximately 300 of our debit clients yet to migrate, but as I mentioned on the last call, we suspended our migrations during the holidays, because banks and credit unions don't like to implement changes to their card programs during that time of the year. We completed another round of migrations in January and remain on-track to complete the migration process during calendar 2020. Although we haven't done a press release on this, I'm happy to announce during December we became the first processor in the country to bring a financial institution live with the real time payments network through the clearing house, and we will bring the second customer live later this month. As I mentioned on the last call, our pace center solution has been designed to allow us to connect clients to the real time payments network in groups rather than one at a time. Additionally, we provide connectivity through this single platform to multiple providers, which facilitates a more logical and efficient approach for our clients than any other processor in the market today. As we begin the second half of our fiscal year, we continue to be optimistic about the strengths of our technology solutions, our abilities to deliver outstanding service to our customers, our ability to expand our customer relationships, the spending environment, and our long-term prospects for success.  With that, I will turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Dave. The service and support line of revenue increase 8% compared to the prior year, quarter. Our license and related in-house support created some headwinds both being now combined $3.1 million for the quarter compared to last year, which primarily is due to the continued moving the customers to our private cloud, which actually is good for us and our shareholders long-term in many ways. Outsourcing and cloud services were up nicely again this quarter at an increase of 16% compared to last year. As Dave mentioned, deconversion fees were up a little over million dollars compared to your go quarter. The processing line of revenue, which is all of our transaction, remittance, card and digital grew a very nice 10% compared to the prior year quarter. Total revenue was up 9% for the quarter or the last year and on a non-GAAP basis, our revenue was 8% for quarter by excluding the deconversion fees. Reported consolidate operating margins were down slightly from 20.8% last year to 22.4% this year primarily due to lower license fees and the continued increase in additional costs related to our card processing platform migration, which we will continue to see these margin headwinds through the remainder of this fiscal year and into next fiscal year until we can eliminate the additional costs related to the platform migration. With the cost reductions that we have talked about on previous calls that we will see the impact from in the first and third quarters of FY21, the impact those cost reduction will have on our quarterly and fiscal margins will remove those headwinds and allow us to return to a position of leveraging our operating income margins. Our segments operating margins continue to be very solid with small fluctuations and our payments segment will continue to have that increased margin headwind going forward as additional costs continue to increase as we migrate customers to the new payments platform until we can get the last core customers off in Q4 of this fiscal year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was relatively flat with last year at 23.2% this year compared to 22.9% last year. For cash flow included in the total amortization was disclosed in the press release is the amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to 4.9 million year-to-date this fiscal year compared to 5.2 million last year. Our depreciation is up year-to-date, primarily due data center CapEx in the first half of last and hardware upgrades this fiscal year which are in production and our non-acquisition amortization was up due to more of our internally developed products being placed into production. Operating cash flow was 215 million for year-to-date, which is up from 192 million last year. During first half the year, we invested 94.2 million back into our Company through CapEx and developing products, which is up - over 5% from 89.7 million a year ago. To update your FY20 guidance. As we have discussed previously, we have no control over the timing of recognized deconversion fees that we received. However, at this time, we anticipate deconversion revenue to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year compared to last year\u2019s second half, which means FY20 will be up over the previous year due to the large first quarter and the small increase we had in Q2. In addition, revenue from our processing and private cloud customers will continue to grow nicely. And therefore, total GAAP revenue should grow a little over 9% for full-year FY20, compared FY19. And then, excluding deconversion fees for both years an incremental revenue contributed to this year from an acquisition of Geezeo which will be about approximately $10 million for the full-year. Our non-GAAP revenue should grow a little over 8% compared to last year. With increased deconversion fees, offset by the continued decreased license and related implementation revenue and additional cost headwinds from our payments platform migration, we project operating income will grow at a slight discount to revenue growth at a little above 8% on a GAAP basis. Then, excluding revenue and related costs associated with deconversion fees and the small net operating income impact from the acquisition, our operating income should grow between 6% and 6.5% on a non-GAAP basis for the full fiscal year. We will continue to experience revenue and operating income fluctuations between our fiscal quarters due to license, implementation, platform migrations and software subscription usage. We anticipate GAAP operating margins for the year to be mostly in-line with FY19 at approximately 22% for the year and excluding all the things just mentioned, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 21%. Our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year will continue to be between 23% and 23.5%. We project Q3 EPS to be in a range of $0.80 to $0.82 and for the full-year of FY20, we are increasing our EPS guidance from the previous range of $3.60 to $3.64 we provided last quarter to a current projected range of $3.70 to $3.72. This concludes our opening comments and we are now ready to take questions. Sherrie, will you please open the call lines up for questions. Operator : Of course. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Vasu Govil with KBW. Vasundhara Govil : Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. I guess the first question, you have already seen pretty strong top-line performance and we are seeing the guidance raise here. Could you talk about like outside of deconversion fees where you are seeing more strength versus what you had anticipated coming into the year and also the sustainability of this 8% non-GAAP revenue growth beyond 2020? David Foss : So, I will comment first and then I will ask Kevin to add on anything that he wants to add. So first off, I think the win rates that we are seeing on the core side of the business and virtually every core customer that we are signing now is a hosted core customer, which means you don't just get revenue prop on the front end, you get revenue - layers in and as sustainable. Normally those customers are signing a seven year contract these days, sometimes 10-year contracts. The payments business, so we have talked many times on this call about the reason that we went through the conversion to the new payment - the card platform. The reason was we were not only not winning customers five years ago, but we were starting to lose customers because the functionality wasn't there. Today, we are signing new customers, bringing new revenue in because of the functionality on the payments platform that we didn't have before, and we certainly are seeing a good demand as referenced on the call. I pointed out, we signed 30 new debit and three new credit customers just in this single quarter. So, that certainly is adding and is sustainable for us. The interest that we have on the digital side of the house, so I referenced 25 new clients for our full suite digital banking platform, that is continuing to grow and we are continuing to see strong demand in that area. So, and I could list a number of other products, but those are kind of the headlines as far as where a lot of the product growth is coming from and that growth is still out there. The pipeline is solid. I mentioned the sales team is running well ahead now this year and not just ahead of what their quota was, but ahead of last year's record pace. That is the important point here, they are running ahead of last year's record sales year. So a lot happening as far as new product sales and then Kevin, whatever are you going to add to that? Kevin Williams : The only thing I would add to that is if you remember last fiscal year we signed 57 new core customers. We signed 22 new core customers this year-to-date. So we are keeping pretty much on a pace of one a week actually for the last couple of years, as we continue to convert and migrate those customers over to our platforms that is going to continue to drive both core complimentary revenue. And as Dave mentioned this on his comments, we continue to see a very solid move of our existing in-house customers from in-house to outsourcing, which is just very nice built in organic revenue as we move those customers over and we get a larger wallet share out of those institutions. Vasundhara Govil : Great, thanks, that is very helpful. And just a quick follow-up on the sort of M&A environment that we are seeing in the banking industry. There has been a couple of merger of equals where I guess you guys are the core provider, for one of the parties and these are potentially larger than average client relationships for you. And I just wanted to get a sense for how you were thinking about your competitive positioning about winning these conversions or if you think, so your competitors may have a better hand given that they are more dominant players up market? David Foss : Sure. Well you know it is no secret that some of our competitors have more dominant position in the upper tiers of the market. But we are well positioned; we have talked many times on these calls about all the solutions that we have been rolling out to serve larger financial institutions. The thing that I would encourage you to keep in mind though and I feel great about our position with some of these deals that are happening right now. But you know, the thing to keep in mind is these days the core represents certainly a nice piece of the business. But because so many of our solutions are offered through the Profit Stars candles today, meaning they are provided regardless of what the core solution is. It is possible for us these days to lose on the core side and still have it be a win for Jack Henry. Because those larger institutions oftentimes are in-house rather than hosted and so they are not paying nearly the rate of the hosted customer, you know on our private cloud. And if they retain some of the complimentary solutions which are hosted in private cloud at Jack Henry, now that can end up being a real win for Jack Henry. So we are in several of those deals and we are well positioned to win those deals. But as you point out, we are not the dominant player in that space. And so if we were to lose on the core side, there is still a tremendous amount of opportunity for Jack Henry in the non-core piece of business with those customers. Kevin Williams : And just a reminder of those customers are typically in-house customers. So if we would have to lose them we are losing in-house maintenance and none of those customers represent more than 1% of our revenue. Vasundhara Govil : Got it. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Hey, good morning Dave and Kevin. Dave I wanted to just ask a little bit about a migration you are doing on your debit and credit customers. And I think last time you talked about retention was really good. You are not seeing any leakage of clients. I just wanted to find out you know where that stood and where you stand in terms of net clients as you roll out this new platform. David Foss : Yes. So it is a good question Kartik . So I didn't want to give the impression on the last call and I certainly wouldn't on this call that we haven't lost any customers. But the good news is, I think every one of them, I maybe shouldn't say every, but the vast majority that have gone away, and there aren't that many, have been because they were acquired along the way. So we have had 30 or so customers 40 somewhere in that range that have been acquired or merged along the way. And so, you know, when they get acquired, sometimes their business is combined with somebody else, if it is a Jack Henry customer, they potentially go to a different platform. So we have lost a few along the way because of mergers, but I don't know of more than a handful that we have lost, because they have decided that you are going to put us through a conversion we ought to maybe look at other solutions, let's look at going someplace else. So, that has been a very small number, but there have been some as I mentioned, have been lost because of M&A. But, I would offset that with all of these new customers that we have signed, I have headlined in here the 73 are live already and we have a number in the queue, 73 that we are not paying Jack Henry of anything before on the debit processing side, before - this new platform. Kartik Mehta : And Kevin, I know the savings from this platform you had articulated in the past a little bit and I was wondering as you get more into it, have your thoughts changed at all as to the dollar amounts you can save from this conversion? Kevin Williams : No. I mean, the dollar amounts I gave previously Kartik, I think are still pretty solid. I think there is still some potential upside to those numbers. You know, we always try to be somewhat conservative and cautious when we give numbers like that. The numbers I gave for savings that we are going to see as we shut the two platforms down in Q4 this year and Q2 of next year. Obviously as Dave mentioned, we are still on course to get all of our core customers off in Q4 and then the remaining non-core customers off the second platform off by the end of Q2. So, we will see those nice costs and obviously if you kind of take those costs savings that we are going to see that I have provided in the past and just throw those into this year's quarter, obviously the margins look a whole lot better. Kartik Mehta : And then finally, Kevin, I just want to make sure on the deconversion fees, as of now from what you can see, you would expect second half of this fiscal year to be the same as second half of last fiscal year? Kevin Williams : That is what it looks like right now. Kartik Mehta : Okay. Thank you very much. Kevin Williams : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Davis with Raymond James. John Davis : Hey, good morning, guys. David, maybe I want to start out on the bookings number, I think 18% is pretty robust, but also trying to remember last time you gave that on kind of a quarterly basis. So, how does that compare with either last quarter or last year and then how long does it take for those bookings to turn into revenue typically? David Foss : Okay. I can't give you an accurate number as far as last quarter, but you know my key point there was we are up 18% year-to-date over last year at this time. So again, it is not a comparison to quota, it is a comparison to actual performance last year by the sales team bookings up 18%. I can't give you an accurate number as compared to last quarter. Last quarter was strong, but the second quarter combined with the first quarter produced this really outstanding run rate for the half of the year. As far as when things translate to revenue, because today most of the solutions that we sign are \u2013 we are delivering as a hosted solution regardless of whether it is core or any of the other things we deliver, it is rare for us anymore to sell a licensed copy of software. And so in every one of those instances then where it is hosted in the cloud delivery, that revenue is layered in overtime. So, with core conversion usually you start to see processing revenue a year or so after we signed the deal. Payments, contract you can start to see revenue often times within a quarter or two. So, it just depends on what the solution is, what the timing is, and sometimes that is driven by us, you know we need X amount of time in order to complete the conversion. Sometimes it is driven by the financial institution because they need to do training and make sure everybody's ready for whatever it is that we are delivering. So, it is all over the Board as far as when things get layered in when the revenue starts to produce. But I think the key point in that is today it is rare for us to see it in the same quarter or the next quarter, because it is so rare for us to sell a licensed version of the solution. John Davis : Okay, that is helpful. And then maybe just quickly dive in a little bit on payments growth and - of acceleration. It was North of 10% this quarter and you called out some of the, the new wins there, but how should we think about that kind of going forward? Keep waiting for it to come back down a little bit as comps get tougher but it is kind of growing faster. So you know how should we think about that going forward? Is this a business that can grow double-digits in the near-term or kind of any changes to the longer term outlook of that business. Kevin Williams : So John this is Kevin. I mean, we have talked about this many times, if you think back three to four years ago when we started this migration, we were losing quite a few customers off our debit platform, because we did not have the technology they wanted. When we made this move, little over two years ago and came out and told the world that we were going to make this move, we kind of stopped the bleeding, but we were still losing customers. We had customers that had already signed to leave at the time. So about a year ago, we finally - totally stopped the bleeding. We started signing a few new customers as David mentioned. We signed quite a few new customers last year. We continue to sign them this year and we are not losing those customers now. So the growth that we are seeing right now, and I predicted this a year ago and I was very hesitant to do it, I think as accelerated payments growth is going to - we are going to see that for the foreseeable future because of the new wins that we are having. And obviously the new wins that Dave mentioned, we signed this quarter, none of those are even producing any revenue yet. John Davis : Got you. And then quickly just on the revenue guide for the full-year, I think about a 70 basis point tailwind from the new deal, even if I back that out, it looks like you guys are calling for deceleration in the back half of the year. Despite, I think what would be easier comps, I know last year we had a lot of accounting related noise that messed up this kind of the quarterly cadence - from an accounting perspective or otherwise. David Foss : Well John, we still have the same accounting noise, because remember under 606, Q1 is going to continue to be a very strong quarter, because of all the software's and service that we sell in subscription software. We recognize 100% of that revenue in Q1. So I mean Q2 was actually strong enough. Otherwise going to be Q3 and Q4 will be a little slower growth in the first half just because Q1 will continue to be our strongest quarter under the new 606 rules. John Davis : Okay. Alright, thanks guys. David Foss : Yep. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Joseph Foresi : Hi. My first question is just around the competitive environment. Obviously your competitors are going through some massive M&A at this point. What are you seeing from a day-to-day win perspective? How distracted do you think those players are and is this creating an environment where you are allowed to take you know more market share? David Foss : It is a good question, Joe. I have been hesitant on these calls in the past to say that our major competitors are so distracted that that is going to create a whole bunch of opportunity for Jack Henry. I have had a number of people in the industry suggest that that is happening, it is probably going to happen. Our win rates is running right now on the core side at a little over one new core deal per week, and we have been at that pace for about two and a half years now. We see a lot of interest in Jack Henry solutions as I mentioned before, sales are up overall. Can I attribute that to our competitors taking their eye off the ball? I don't know that I'm prepared to do that yet. But we are certainly engaged in a lot of deals right now and the pace of activity with Jack Henry is, I don't know if I can say at an all time high, but it is probably about an all time high right now as far as interest in Jack Henry solutions and the pace of interest that we see out there in the market. And I'm not ready to describe that to anything specific happening with our competitors, I just know there is a lot of interest in Jack Henry technology solutions. Joseph Foresi : Got it. And then you talked a little bit about, and we have seen some solid results from some of the upgrade of your offerings, that is my read on it. And I'm wondering, do you feel like you have got the full suite in place now and that maybe that upgrade, I'm just trying to get at what is causing sort of a pickup over the last 12 months to 24 months in deal wins. Do you feel like you did see improvement in your suite of offerings and that some of the card upgrades or product upgrades on the card side are leading to it? I'm just trying to get a sense again of what has caused the uptick. David Foss : Yes, I do. I think it is a solid observation. So, we have spent a lot of time, particularly in the last year and a half or two years talking about all these new technology solutions we have rolled out, treasury management and the Banno suite and digital suite and our enterprise risk management solution. I just today talked about I think anywhere, we have been in the market almost a year, but we haven't talked about it on this call yet, because we wanted to make sure that everything proved out. And so, yes, I think you are right. It is a combination of new look and feel, new user experience for some of the solutions that we have had for awhile. Then we rolled out a number of new technologies from the ground up, new technology to our customers and prospects that we just didn't have two or three years ago. And so I think you are on the right track there with the idea that it is kind of a refreshed and a much broader suite than we had previously. And then you add to that some of the acquisitions that we have done recently. So, we haven't done - the recollections you have seen us doing in the last two, three years haven't been needle movers as far as revenue is concerned, but they have definitely been needle movers from a strategic point of view. So, we have created this very robust commercial lending center suite now that is getting a lot of attention. I didn't even talk about it on today's call, but I have talked about it many times in past. So, that was a very intentional move of - few - little acquisitions that we put together to create that new solution. The Geezeo acquisition, Kevin highlighted the revenue contribution on the call earlier. That is not a needle mover for Jack Henry, but from a strategy point of view, it definitely makes us a differentiated solution with our digital suite. So, I think the combination of all of those things has positioned us well. The challenge when you are in our business is, you are never done. You constantly have to be re-examining your solutions and refreshing and trying to find that opportunity to differentiate from everybody else. But, I feel great about how we are position today with the things that we have been talking about on these calls for the last couple of years. Kevin Williams : And one of the things there Joe is, again, I think we have very clear focus. We go to the market primary with two flagship products, SilverLake on the bank side and [X] (Ph) from the credit side, and those are the products that we spend our R&D dollars on. And you know, SilverLake was ticked last year by [indiscernible] is the best core system for banks in the $1 billion to $50 billion space. So, when you get that reputation and you have the core products to wrap all that new technology that Dave mentioned around those things. The combination of all that I think is why we continue to win and continue to win in the market. Joseph Foresi : Got it. And then the last one for me, and Kevin, I'm glad you said something. It is for you. We have been waiting for the margins to expand and free cash flow to pick up, due to the sunset of the products. I know you said that it is a next year event. Can you just give us an update on your level of confidence that we are finally going to see that next year and maybe a little bit of detail around why you have that level of confidence. Thanks. Kevin Williams : Well, I mean, Joe obviously we know what our cost is in the platforms that we are running on those for our debit card systems today. We know the personnel that will be going away, so we know what those hard dollar costs are and there is additional cost throughout the organization that we will also be able to eliminate. So for the numbers that I gave and the numbers that are going to go away kind of in two big tranches in Q4 this year and Q2 of next year, I\u2019m extremely confident that those costs will go away and we will see very nice increase in margins in both Q1 and Q3 of the next fiscal year. Joseph Foresi : Alright. Thank you. Kevin Williams : Yep. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Heckmann with Davidson. Peter Heckmann : Good morning gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. Could you talk about any regulatory deadlines including Cecil that maybe playing into some of the bookings and anything else that is on the radar that needs to act as a catalyst for some upgrade. David Foss : Yes. Good question Peter. Two years ago or a year and a half ago or whenever it was Cecil was definitely a catalyst for us and I was excited to talk about Cecil back then. Today, although we had the first wave, I guess January 1st went into effect. For the second wave, the timeline has been extended and so Cecil is definitely not a driver right now. Everybody who needed it by January 1, has it. And for those that needed it in the second wave, the smaller institutions, they have been given an extra reprieve. So there is not much action right now when it comes to Cecil. And beyond that no major regulatory change that is driving revenue for us or any of our competitors, you know, there is just not a lot happening there that is producing revenue. Obviously we have a lot of expense around regulation. We are constantly having to ensure that our systems comply, but no revenue drivers right now being fueled by regulatory change. Peter Heckmann : Got it. And then just another question on the commercial lending, where does that product sit in the competitive landscape? What are some of the differentiating aspects more on the origination or management reporting side? David Foss : That is the unique piece of that solution is that it does all of those. So it is designed to be an online commercial lending solution. Meaning the borrower can apply for a commercial loan online, all electronic. So they don't have to drop off paper forms at the financial institution. They can do everything electronic. It has a quick decision engine that came through one of the small acquisitions that we did. So if the bank chooses, they can automate the decision process. So for a smaller commercial loan, the borrower can get an automated decision back in an hour or 30 minutes or whatever the bank sets. For larger loans, they would normally send it to a loan committee or at least some more formal review, but still can provide the response to online to the commercial borrower. And then for the bank. So it is not just the front end origination of the loan to the borrower, it is for the bank to manage the loan through the life of the loan. So as requirements come up, for example, on an annual basis for the banker to receive financial statements and review and approve those financial statements. That is all automated into the same platform. So, the backend functionality at the bank is there as well. So, it is completely differentiated as compared to any other solution out there that is doing online commercial lending offering. So, people who kind of dig into it, commercial lenders who dig into it are pretty impressed and love the solution. And the Chief Loan Officer for the financial institution likes it, because it is a tool that allows the lender to be more efficient and spend more time with their clients and less time administering or dealing with [administrative] (Ph). So, being widely tailed by lenders as a productivity tool as well. Peter Heckmann : Great. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Glenn Greene : Hello. Thanks. Hey, good morning Dave and Kevin. David Foss : Good morning. Glenn Greene : I guess just the first question, you sort of alluded to the number of competitive takeaways. I think it was 17 in the quarter. Can you just sort of - first of all, what was it year-to-date and can you sort of frame that relative to a typical year? It strikes me as an acceleration, like improved competitive position for you. David Foss : Well for the quarter it was Glen. But, if you look at the first half of the year, so that is 23 or 24 for the first half of the year, which is why I said earlier, our pace for the last two and a half years has been one a week, and we are continuing on that pace. So, you know sometimes the thing about core decisions is they can lapse over into the next quarter, so we didn't have as many as normal in the first quarter, but a lot of those were really close to signing, they fell into the second quarter, so it kind of evens out. So, I'm very comfortable saying we are on the same pace, which is leading the industry by far, the same pace that we have been on for the last two and a half years or so, which is about one new core customer per week. Glenn Greene : Okay. And then to an earlier question, you alluded to sort of I think the pace of demand that at an all time high, I guess the question is why, you could sort of allude to a number of factors, market environment, you alluded to a better product suite. I don't think you want to go there, but maybe a better competitive situation given your competitors may be distracted. Is there any way to sort of frame it and why you are seeing sort of an all time pace with demand? David Foss : Yes, I wish I could give you an absolute answer, Glenn. I think it is a combination of several of those things, as I highlighted earlier on the call. I think these new solutions that we have rolled out here in the past two, three years are getting a lot of attention, a lot of demand, the payments platform, the treasure management solution, the Banno Digital suite, commercial lending center suite, enterprise risk, all these things that we have been talking about that we have rolled out in the last couple of years are creating demand not only for the solutions, but they are creating kind of a refreshed view objective - in the space as a leader when it comes to new technology and doing innovative things with technology. I think it is a combination of a variety of things and when you are winning at the pace that we have been on the core side, people hear about that. And so, then there is some of that chatter that happens. How come these guys are winning these core deals? They must be doing something right. And I think it is a combination of all those things coming together and right now, we don't see that slowing down. Glenn Greene : Okay. And then Kevin, I think you said outsourcing grew 16% in the quarter, my guess is that new deals sort of converting on, but is sort of mid-teens is sustainable? Kevin Williams : Well, I don't know if mid-teens is sustainable Glenn, but I mean, if you look back over the last two years, our outsourcing has been growing at the 12% to 13% range. So, I mean, it popped up a little bit, but I think in that 12% to 14% is very sustainable. Glenn Greene : Okay. thanks guys. David Foss : Yep. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Koning with Baird. David Koning : Hey guys, great job. I just got a few numbers questions, I guess just to make sure, I think you said before there is about 16 million cost savings once you kind of move off the old platform and I think you said a third and fiscal Q1 of 2021, so if we think that 16 million, it is kind of four million per quarter, a third of that four million comes off in fiscal Q1 and then the full run rate is off by Q3 is that still the right way to think of it? Kevin Williams : Yes. David Koning : Okay, good. And then the second one is just free cash flow. The pattern changes quarter, like you had an outstanding cash flow, usually fiscal Q1 and Q4 are really strong and Q2 and Q3 are weak just normal seasonal patterns, but Q2 was like really strong this quarter. Is that a new pattern or did something change like just for just for this time? Kevin Williams : Well, a couple of things Dave. I mean If you look over historical numbers, you are absolutely right. We have always been extremely strong in Q1 and Q4 because of our annual maintenance billings, but as our business continues to shift to more, not only recurring, but more of a monthly billing and a cash inflow from our private cloud and our outsourcing and also for our payments, then our Q2 and Q3 are no longer cash burning quarters. They are both starting to generate nice cast. So it is starting to level out a little bit. And to that point, if you look back our trailing 12 months, we are just a little over 99% conversion of net income to free cash flow. So we are getting right back up to that 100%. I think, again when we get into FY21, I think our conversion rate is going to be well back up by 100% conversion, as we are able to take those additional costs out. David Koning : Okay, great. And just one last quick one. You know, last year the organic growth pattern starting in Q1 went eight, seven, five, four. This year, now it seems more like, I think Q1 was nine, Q2 was eight and it kind of feels like the rest of the year is going to be right around eight. So it is a much more stable year, I know Q1 is a little is a little higher still, but is this year more than normal now, Q1 a little higher and then the rest of you are about the same compared to last year where it kind of decelerated through the year? Kevin Williams : You are exactly on point. So the rest of year is going to be bright at 8% and we are going to finish the year gap like I said over 9% and non-GAAP a little over 8% for the year. David Koning : Now it is really good. Thank you. Kevin Williams : Yep. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens. Brett Huff : Good morning Kevin and Dave. David Foss : Good morning. Kevin Williams : Good morning Brett. Brett Huff : Three questions me, number one. Dave, you mentioned the treasury and cash management solution that is kind of a favorite of mine to understand because it is such a new product and such a fragmented market. Any data on the wins there or any uptick or downtick or kind of how is the interest in progress on that one? David Foss : Sure. We signed seven a treasury in the quarter. We have 36 lives now. And I didn't bring the statistics with me. I just got the numbers for a number of businesses and number of users, live on the platform, it is impressive, the number of businesses and the end users at those businesses using the platform. But 36 institutions live today. Brett Huff : That is helpful. And then to the point of moving up market, you kind of framed this up before and talked about the card business and how that product was needed to kind of service some of the larger banks. I think the same thing with the cash management. I think it is sort of similar with the commercial lending. I know there is a couple of others I'm probably missing. But as we sort of arm ourselves to compete more effectively as we move up market, how is the conversation going with those bigger banks, be they banks for whom you do ProfitStars things and are trying to sell them a core off a competitor or maybe you are just going in cold to a bank, whether you don't have much relationship at all? And this is also framed in the context of these couple of big deals that are mergers or M&A that, how all those conversations going and what are you hearing from those banks? Where are you scoring points and where is the negotiation still sort of ongoing? David Foss : I'm not going to talk specifically about any negotiations. But just in general, I think the banks of that size, it has been interesting a lot of those conversations because there is a great deal of dissatisfaction, in fact, more than I realized. I have been in this business 34-years. A great deal of dissatisfaction among the banks of those size, around the topics of integration, and the ease of connecting to third-parties, whether it be through a traditional tool or an API set. There is a lot of frustration, a lot of demand among those customers. So that bodes well for Jack Henry. We have a great track record of open connectivity, developing tools that really make life easier for the institution, put that together with all of these new solutions that we have been rolling out that are specifically designed for larger institutions. We are scoring a lot of points there. Now, it is no secret, and I referenced it earlier on the call, you know if you don't have a track-record in that space, say about $50 billion in assets, that is a difficult decision for somebody to say, okay, I think I will be the first one to partner with these guys to go into that space on the core side. So there are ongoing conversations, we are scoring points, but then there are things that work against us and we are just going to continue hammering away at it. But for Jack Henry, we are committed to moving up market and you have seen us make a lot of moves here in the past a few years, and that we are going to continue moving in that direction. But you know, we don't have to be the dominant player among the $100 billion banks to be successful. We have lots of runway here doing what we are doing and have been doing kind of slowly but surely growing up into that space. Brett Huff : That's helpful. And then last one for me, just this whole Mitek, Wells Fargo, USAA thing that is going on, it is hard for us to kind of figure out when you pull that string, who might get smeared in that. Does that relate to you all in any way or how do we think about that? Anything to worry about there? David Foss : I don't know that there is anything to worry about. It potentially affects all of us that are in this space that offer imaging solutions, whether it be image viewing through an internet or digital banking solution, whether it be capturing text and converting them to images. All of those technologies, which all of us that are major players in the space offer those technologies, those are - potentially come into play for all of us. But at this stage of the game, I wouldn't categorize it as something to worry about, but it certainly is something that we have our eyes on. Brett Huff : Great. Thanks for the time guys. I appreciate it. David Foss : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. As you sit down with the bank and credit union CEOs, can you comment on their 2020 IT budget growth outlook, top spending priorities and then any nuance you might offer, let's say between larger banks and smaller banks would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. David Foss : Sure Dave. I will get survey information here within the next month or so I think. There are a couple of surveys that we depend on every year. So, everything I will share with you is anecdotal. But the thing that I can say is, in the fall of each year, I think you know, I host a CEO conference on the banking side and separate one credit union side. And so, those conversations, we usually have, you know, 200, 300 CEOs at those meetings, those conversations often we ended up talking about the future for spending, their demand for technology and so on. And I can tell you as of this late fall, just before the holiday season, CEO optimism and their commitment to continue to spend was still there. I mean in particular things like digital. So that is why I think a lot of demand we have talked about here around digital, any of them are trying to figure out how to modernize the consumer experience for their consumers and what are the tools they can use to monetize that.  So that brings into play the online commercial lending center suite we talked about, it brings into play the Banno suite that we talked about. So CEO optimism continues to be high. They have kind of adjusted to the interest rate environment that they live in. They are not happy about it, but they have adjusted to it and we don't see that slowing down. And that is anecdotal. I will get more formal survey information here certainly before the next earnings call, but I don't expect a major shifts just based on what I'm hearing from the CEOs talk to. David Togut : I appreciate that. And then just any nuance or kind of anecdotal information from your conversations between let's say mid to large size banks and smaller banks, you had good traction with treasury management in the up market space. So when you speak to some of the larger banks are there any difference in terms of spending priorities? You know, demand picture for 2020? David Foss : Yes. It is a good question. I think for me the only nuance there would be the larger banks are intensely focused on their efficiency ratio and are looking for what are those tools that can help drive their efficiency ratio up. The smaller banks, the efficiency ratio is a topic, but they are not as intensely focused, not as ready to go spend money just to improve efficiency ratio with larger banks that is absolutely a key topic for them. That is probably the major difference that I see in the conversations. David Togut : Understood. Thank you very much. David Foss : Thank you David. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with Wells Fargo. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good morning. And thank you for taking my question. I was hoping you could comment on the long-term margin profile of the overall business given some of the momentum you have generated in some newer solutions that may not have been as material contributors in the past. So wondering if we look past 2021 and the elimination of some of the redundant card platform fees if the revenue mix changes. Do you envision any material changes to the overall margin profile or any seasonal patterns? Kevin Williams : Well, so this is Kevin. I don't think you are going to see much seasonal change because I mean we are 86% recurring revenue now and that is only going to get bigger. Payments continue to make up about 36% of our revenue. Our outsourcing and private cloud offerings are about 25% or 26% of our revenue and the balance of the recurring revenue is in-house maintenance, which is slowly shifting over to outsourcing, which those margins continue to improve a little bit as our payments business continues to get larger. So as I said in my opening comments, once we get through the first half of 2021 and get those additional costs taken out, we are going to go back to our more traditional margins and at that point we will go back to getting some traditional margin expansion of 50 to a 100 bips a year for the foreseeable future. Unidentified Analyst : Great. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Kevin Williams : Yep. Operator : Thank you. I am showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any further remarks. David Foss : Thanks Sherrie. First of all, I would like to point out that, once again we will be holding our Annual Analyst Day in the Dallas, Texas area on Monday, May 11th and to Brett Huff\u2019s point something we will have the Mini Tech Fair again. So, some of the products that we will be highlighting there would be our digital solutions, the commercial lending platform, our payments platform that we have spent so much time talking about and treasury and cash management. So, invitations will be going out in the next few weeks for that event. We hope many of you on this call and others can make it to the event this year. Now, we are pleased with results from our ongoing operations and the efforts of all of our associates to take care of our customers. Our executives, managers and all of our associates continue to focus on what is best for our customers and our shareholders. I want to thank you again for joining us today. And Sherrie, will you please now provide the playback number. Operator : Yes. The playback number will be 800-585-8367 with conference ID number 8218009. Again, that's 800-585-8367, conference ID number, 8218009. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Stephanie. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the Jack and Associates third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. I\u2019m Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer and on the call with me today is David Foss, our President and CEO. In just a minute, I will turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the state of our business and performance for the quarter and as well some comments about response related to the impacts of COVID-19. And then after that I\u2019ll provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release, we put out yesterday after market closed and provide comments regarding the guidance Q4 and full year FY20 provided in the release and then we\u2019ll open the lines up for questions and answer. First, I need to remind you this call includes certain forward-looking statements including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these Risk Factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday\u2019s press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and forward-looking statements. On this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliation for historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found in yesterday\u2019s press release. With that I will now turn the call over to Dave. Dave Foss : Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. Those of you who listen to our earnings calls on a regular basis may recall that I started every earnings call I\u2019ve ever done by thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication to our customers and our company. At no time have I ever been more passionate about that point than I am today. Since the onset of this pandemic the Jack Henry team has moved mountains to address the unprecedented needs of our customers while at the same time demonstrating true commitment to each other and our communities. To give you a sense of what that effort has included. Here are just a few of the key initiatives completed by our teams since early March. Our crisis management team began conducting daily meetings at the beginning of March to provide an ongoing review of information and plans for every aspect of our business. They have been instrumental in our planning and success as the world around us has changed so significantly. Early in March our human resources team enhanced our healthcare program to cover 100% of COVID-19 related medical treatment for all employees. We announced that we were operating full time work from home status on March 16 and our corporate technology services team successfully transitioned 96% of our employees by the end of that week. The other 4% are required in a Jack Henry location everyday to manage one of our data center operations. Those employees began receiving bonuses immediately after we moved to a work from home status. Our lending solutions team launched an online Paycheck Protection Program offering for our customers within three business days of the CARES Act being passed in early April. We had customers processing loans for their small business two days before the SBA was ready to start funding those loans. We also expanded our lending network to provide support for our clients, who are unable to book a loan for one or more of their small business clients. To-date we have helped our clients process almost 70,000 loans through the PPP program. And lastly as you can probably imagine, call volumes in our call centers have increased exponentially as our customers and their consumers moved out of their offices due to various stay at home orders. During that time, not only have the Jack Henry customer service team has risen to the occasion. But they did at well improving on our already industry leading response times and customer service ratings, truly remarkable. These are just a few examples of the outstanding efforts put forth by our team during this crisis. In the past many of you have commented on the unique culture at Jack Henry, a culture built on the, do the right thing and do whatever it takes mantra. Never has that culture been on display in a more meaningful way than what we\u2019ve witnessed during the past couple of months. I could not be more proud of our team in their ongoing commitment to our customers and our company and I thank every one of them for weathering this storm with grace and passion. Of course we\u2019re not at the end of the road when it comes to the dealing with the ongoing impacts of COVID-19. We continue to operate primarily in a remote status and our customers continue to get comfortable with their new operating model. Although most of our clients are still unsure about the long-term impacts on their businesses, we\u2019re seeing many get back to focusing on the day-to-day. A good measure of this shift is the level of engagement we saw with our sales team in April as things started to settle a bit. Of particular note, we\u2019ve already signed five new core competitive takeaways in April as well as a variety of other new contracts and the combined sales organization exceeded their quota for the month of April. We will be closely monitoring sales performance and sales pipelines as the fourth quarter continues to progress. With that, let\u2019s shift our focus to look at our performance for the quarter we completed in March. For the third quarter of fiscal 2020, total revenue increased 13% for the quarter and increased 9% on a non-GAAP basis. The conversion fees were up almost $15 million over the prior year quarter with almost all of that variance attributed to a single customer in New York. If you exclude the deconversion revenue variance and focus on the non-GAAP number, you can see we posted a very strong overall revenue quarter. Turning to the segments, we again had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 12% for the quarter and increased 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segments also performed well posting a 11% increase in revenue this quarter and then 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had an extremely strong quarter in our complementary solutions business with 16% increase in revenue this quarter and 11% increase on a non-GAAP basis. Despite the obvious COVID-19 challenges for the sales team at the end of the quarter, all three of our sales groups again hit or exceeded their quota and for the year, they continue to run ahead of last year\u2019s record pace. In the third fiscal quarter, we booked 14 competitive core takeaways and 11 deals to move existing in-house customers to our private cloud environment. Our Banno Digital Platform continues to see very strong demand with 24 new clients signing for the full digital suite in the quarter. We also signed 16 new clients to our new card processing solution. Speaking of the new card processing platform, we have been providing regular updates on our progress during these calls for the past several quarters. We are now 82% complete with the migrations and we ended March with almost 750 financial institutions on the new platform. Prior to the onset of COVID-19, we were poised to wrap the migration for our core clients by June 30 and had all 136 of those clients scheduled to convert in April, May and June. In early April however, several of the clients on those lists asked us to delay the schedule because they had minimized their employee presence in their offices and didn\u2019t want to introduce any new payment solutions while their employee and customers were working remote. As disappointed as were to introduce the delay in a project that is been moving along so well. We determined it was definitely the right thing to do. As a result, we have delayed any migrations previously scheduled in our fiscal Q4 into Q1 of fiscal 2021. I anticipate the migrations for our 86 non-core clients will also be delayed as a ripple effect so we now plan to see those migrations happen in fiscal Q3 of 2021. Regarding implementations for our other solutions, we are working closely with our customers who are scheduled for on-site delivery of our solutions to ensure their needs are met while taking all necessary safety precautions for our employees when they are required to be at a customer site. Delays of customer system installations due to COVID-19 have been very limited and we\u2019ve developed processes to handle remote installation when applicable. We expect these processes to provide the flexibility and value both during and after the pandemic. They\u2019ll continue to work as a partner with our customers regarding implementation plans, customer service needs and support for their end customers to ensure they get the help they need during this difficult time. Despite the uncertainty caused by the ongoing pandemic, let me remind you few of the fundamentals about our company. Fundamentals we empathize regularly in our discussions with investors and analysts. First, more than 85% of our revenue is recurring in nature. Second, we have very little debt on the balance sheet and we continue to operate with a solid cash position. Third, we paid a dividend for 119 consecutive quarters and we continue to be committed to our dividend policy moving forward. Fourth, we have an extremely engaged workforce as evidenced by our Employee Engagement survey results and Best Place to Work awards. And finally, remember that we weathered the financial crisis 12 years ago with very few bumps or bruises. As we move forward, we will inevitably continue to implement minor changes to our delivery and service models. But we don\u2019t anticipate the need to make any significant changes in the way we serve our customers. We have a commitment to doing the right thing for our employees, customers and shareholders, that we believe will service well as we adjust to the new normal. We will continue with our disciplined approach to run the company and expect that approach to help provide continued stability for our company as we move to the other side of this pandemic, at some point in the future. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin Williams : Thanks Dave. The service and support line of revenue increase 15% compared to the prior year quarter. Our outsourcing and cloud services continue to be a big driver in this line of revenue with an 18% compared to last year. As Dave mentioned deconversion fees were up $14.7 million compared to year ago quarter and all of those are included in this line of revenue. If you back out deconversion fees and contribution for acquisition this line of revenue on a non-GAAP basis grew by 8%. The processing line of revenue which is all of our transaction, remittance and digital grew 9% compared to the prior year quarter and again there are no deconversion fees in that line of revenue. Our total revenue was up 11% for the quarter compared to last year and on a non-GAAP basis revenue was 9% for the quarter, which is slightly ahead of our previous guidance. Our reported consolidated operating margins increased slightly from 20% last year to 21.4% which is primarily due to the increase in deconversion fees. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating margins decreased slightly from 18.5% last year to 18.1% this year primarily due to the continued increase in additional cost related to a card processing platform migration. With the delayed migrations that Dave mentioned, we will continue to see these margin headwinds for remainder of the fiscal year and into next fiscal year through Q3 of FY 2021. Until we can eliminate the additional costs related to the platform migration. With this shift in timing and the impacts of COVID-19 at this point it\u2019s hard to determine exactly when we will see margins improvements next fiscal year. But we will definitely see margin improvements in our payments in Q4 of FY 2021 which will get the full year impact in FY 2022. The impact of these cost reductions at that point will remove headwinds and allow us to return to a position of leveraging our operating income margins in FY 2022. Our core and complementary segment operating margin continue to improve with the continued pressure from our payments segments we just discussed is offsetting that improvement. The effective tax rate for the quarter decreased to 19.7% compared to 22.4% last year. This is primarily due to the difference in the uncertain tax positions which are reserved annually under FIN 48 according to IRS and with the lasting statute of limitations between the two periods respective reserves are released. This quarter was impacted a little more heavily due to the additional and above normal releases related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminating the Section 199 deduction so there were no new reserves to offset those Section 199 that were released. Net income was $73.9 million for the third quarter compared to $59.3 million last year with earnings per share of $0.96 this year compared to $0.77 last year. The $0.96 for the quarter included positive impacts from deconversion fees and taxes which were offset by the negative impact from the loss on disposal of assets considering these adjustments our earnings per share related to operations came in slightly ahead of the consensus estimate for the quarter of $0.80. For cash flow our total amortization increased 5% year-to-date compared to last year due to capitalized projects being placed into service and included in the total amortization is amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions which decreased to $15.4 million year-to-date this fiscal year compared to $15.6 million last year. Our depreciation is up year-to-date primarily due to the timing of data center CapEx that we talked about a year ago being placed into service last fiscal year and getting a full nine months of depreciation this year. Our operating cash flow was $276.4 million for the year-to-date which was up from $233.4 million a year ago. We invested $126.8 million back in our company through CapEx and developing products which is up 2% from $123.9 million a year ago. Couple comments on our balance sheet, we currently have a cash position of $109.5 million and we\u2019ll be sending annual maintenance billings at the beginning of June. In February this year, we renewed our revolver with a five-year term and increased the maximum borrowings to $700 million. There was a $55 million withdraw on a revolver at the end of the quarter at March 31 however we do anticipate paying that off by June 30 in the net cash. We have no other long-term debt on our balance sheet other than leases. We are closely monitoring and modeling all lines of revenues and watching relative key performance indicators. We are focused and monitoring cost controls especially in significant areas cost like headcount, travel, meetings and discretionary spend. In our guidance, we are anticipating a slow rebound in debit card usages as parts of the country of reopen. At this point, it appears that income from deconversion fees will be down approximately $1 million compared to last year\u2019s Q4 which to just remind you, we have no control over the timing of recognized deconversion fees that we receive. As reported in the press release, our GAAP guidance for revenue for Q4 is a range of $408 million to $415 million with EPS of $0.77 to $0.79 per share. Our full year revenue guidance was increased to revenue range of $1.695 billion to $1.702 billion with a full year earnings per share of $3.83 to $3.85. We will continue to experience revenue and operating income fluctuations between our fiscal quarters due to various things such as license revenue, implementation timing, our ongoing payment platform migrations and also software subscription usage which obviously you\u2019ll see in Q1 of next year. We anticipate GAAP operating margins for Q4 to be down a little from last year\u2019s fourth quarter, so for the full fiscal year it should be mostly in line with FY 2019 at approximately 22.5% operating margins. Our effective tax rate for FY 2020 should end up at approximately 23% for the full fiscal year. As we\u2019ve historically done, we will be providing revenue and earnings guidance for FY 2021 during our Q4 and year-end earnings call that we will have in August. We are currently in the process of developing our budgets for FY 2021 and evaluating the overall impact to be anticipated and expected from COVID-19. At the same time developing our FY 2021 budget, we will be focused primarily on targets and forecasts specifically for Q1 of FY 2021 to assist with the guidance we will provide in August. However, will remind you as I know you\u2019ll be working on your models before we provide official guidance as Dave mentioned our recurring revenue year-to-date is over 85% and if you remove the one-time deconversion fees and total revenue our recurring revenue is actually a little over 88% of our total revenue. So you be sure, using those as you\u2019re building your models for FY 2021 before we give official guidance at our year-end earnings call. This concludes our openings comments. We\u2019re now ready to take questions. Stephanie, will you please open the caller lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] your first question comes from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Dan Perlin : I hope everyone is healthy and safe. I wanted to start off just at a high level in terms of - as you\u2019ve had conversations or both of you\u2019ve had conversations with your bank partners. I\u2019m wondering what type of insights they\u2019re providing back to you in terms of the health of that channel. Like right now it feels like things are relatively stable but it does also feel like things are likely to get worse there and so I\u2019m just wondering where - what kind of anecdotal evidence you\u2019re hearing from those partners. Dave Foss : Good morning, Dan. It\u2019s Dave. So good question, obviously probably not a surprise to you. We\u2019ve been talking to a lot of our customers here in the past several weeks. Talked to few CEOs just in the past three, four days and I think the consistent feedback from them is. So first out, this crisis that we\u2019re in right now was caused by a health crisis not by a financial crisis. Obviously, it\u2019s created ramifications throughout US economy, but the bankers and credit unions that we work with and the CEOs that I\u2019m talking to have emphasized over and over again that the health of the institutions was really very solid before this came on. So they\u2019re well capitalized, their credit quality is high and plenty of liquidity in, so they\u2019re feeling generally pretty strong about the opportunity in the future lending forward. For those who chose to participate in the PPP program they were being paid by the SBA to process those loans. So there\u2019s an income stream for them there and that\u2019s helping for some institutions some have been very successful in the PPP program and so they feel strongly about the fact that they\u2019re not only helping small business and helping save main street by being administrators of that program and working with small business to help them out. But there is the benefit that there\u2019s some revenue coming in to the financial institutions that helps that dissipates in PPP. So generally everybody is concerned about what future looks like here and when do things \u201creturn to normal\u201d. Generally they\u2019re pretty upbeat that they can weather this storm and yes, they\u2019ll have to be able to some businesses that maybe troubled and they may have some mortgage payments that they\u2019re going to have to accept the idea of delaying a mortgage payment and so on. But they\u2019re generally pretty positive about the future and I think it\u2019s because they recognize that although this is turning into a financial crisis. It wasn\u2019t caused by banks like the one that we went through 12, 13 years ago. Kevin Williams : Yes to Dave\u2019s point, I mean we came out of that one in 2009, 2010 pretty much unscathed and that was a financial crisis. So I mean obviously there\u2019s going to be some issues with the financial industry coming out of this. But obviously the good thing as Dave said, most financial institute went in this very well capitalized with strong balance sheets and they seemed to be still in a pretty good place. Dan Perlin : That\u2019s great. And just as a quick follow-up in terms of trying to understand the implementation cycle impact. I mean I think you gave some good color there. But it does seem like there is going to be some air pockets that get created and so what I\u2019m actually interested is, can you just help us understand how you would do digital knowledge transfer if you couldn\u2019t be physically on-prem for some of these - if this was much more protracted and say but one quarter that you\u2019re going to allude into push into kind of I think the first quarter of next year. Thank you. Dave Foss : Sure, yes. It\u2019s been fun and exciting and kind of remarkable frankly to see the implementation teams shift gears into a new mode of delivery so a lot of the solutions that we deliver were already delivered virtually and we do training online, we do training. We weren\u2019t using a whole to of video to do training before, we are now as people have become much more comfortable with video technology. But we did a lot of implementations remote previously and now many of our teams have adapted the way they do implementations, adapted the way they do training, taking advantage of virtual tools like video to do training. So it really hasn\u2019t interrupted as I mentioned in my opening comments, it hasn\u2019t interrupted our implementation pipeline much at all. In fact I think it was two weekends ago, we did three core conversions on that same weekend. It was either two or three weekends ago and we\u2019re installing Banno Digital suite has always been installed virtual, not always but for year or so has been installed as a virtual install. So the teams have adapted and we\u2019re delivering things differently. There are some customers who aren\u2019t 100% comfortable all the time. They want somebody there to hold their hands and so you know we kind of work through that. But most of our solutions now we\u2019re in a position to implement virtually. Kevin Williams : And Dan for some invitations I mean we still are sending people on site which is one of the nice things about having our own corporate planes, so we can safely take our employees to the facilities and work for the banks through a safe distancing relationship and also we have always done a lot of classroom training virtually which we\u2019re doing that, we\u2019ve got several classroom set up with multiple monitors to do training, so that was already in place. The nice thing about this - we were already 27% of our employees were working remote anyway and probably another 25% to 30% work from home at some point during the week. This was a pretty easy adaption for us to get to where we are today. Dan Perlin : It\u2019s great to hear. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Vasu Govil with KBW. Vasu Govil : Good to talk to you and I\u2019m glad everyone is doing well. I guess just the first question on the revenue deceleration in the fourth quarter. I mean even excluding the deconversion fees it feels like there would be a slight slowdown. Could you talk about what\u2019s driving the impact by segment? Is it mostly the payment segment were you expecting to see the weakness? If you could give us some color there. Kevin Williams : The primary drive we\u2019re seeing and what we\u2019re projecting in Q4 is, as we did see a slowdown in our debit card usage in the last half of March, even though we still had strong payments go through the quarter and so we continue to see that slower debit usage in April and like I said in opening comments. We are assuming and predicting that we will see some rebound in June as the country opens back up that is the primary drag on the revenue growth in Q4. Vasu Govil : Got it, that\u2019s helpful and I guess. I know you will give guidance for 2021 next quarter. But if you could give us some high level color like do you think that fourth quarter will be the top in terms of growth rates or could there be a drag effect depending on what you see on sales. And if could you perhaps compare in contrast how the impacts this time might be different from what you saw in the great financial crisis back then. I guess revenues sort of went from double-digit to flat and then recovered back pretty quickly like what kind of sort of recovery curve, might you see this time? Thank you. Kevin Williams : I think it\u2019s a little different now to look at our financials compared to what you saw back in the financial crisis and the difference is, ASC 606 because remember we\u2019re now under different rev rec rules than we were back then, so when we were able to start delivering software and little quicker back then which obviously we don\u2019t deliver a whole lot software now. So you\u2019re not going to see a sudden rebound. However we\u2019ve been under ASC 606 for two years now and we will be by the end of this fiscal year. So now you kind of see the fluctuations created in our financials the last couple of years which Q1 is typically the high quarter now because of all the software usage and subscription revenue that has to be recognized at the beginning of the year which that grows every year as we continue to sell those throughout the year. And then it kind of tapers off throughout the year from Q1 to Q4 which is kind of opposite from the way it used to be. So I think as I said in opening comments with recurring revenue being 88% of our total revenue. We still have a solid backlog. Through Q1 our sales bookings were still up 12% over last year. As Dave pointed out in his opening comments, we actually exceeded quarter for April. So do we anticipate some headwinds on sales, yes. But having said all that, I feel really good going into FY 2021 at this point. Vasu Govil : Thanks, that\u2019s very helpful. Dave Foss : I think a key point to remember there is, when we signed a new core customer, we don\u2019t see any of that revenue for months after that customer is signed and then once we do start to see revenue, it\u2019s layered in as opposed to getting a pop in that revenue. So and that\u2019s core. Now many of our other solutions are maybe a little shorter implementation timeline, but it is rare for us to sell - we\u2019re not sell and bill kind of company normally. We\u2019re sell and put in the backlog and it gets rolled out and the revenue gets layered in. so that\u2019s part of the predictability of the model. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Good morning, Kevin and Dave. Hope you\u2019re both staying well. Just bridging to the earlier question, could you talk about potential inflection points in the business as a result of COVID-19? For example, you\u2019ve had very strong demand for a while for Banno Digital suite. But do you expect to see an accelerating shift towards digital banking as more consumers perhaps don\u2019t want to walk into bank branches? Dave Foss : That\u2019s a good question, Dave and definitely I think you\u2019re on the right track there so the things that we\u2019re seeing right now. It was interesting as the whole COVID-19 thing was coming into play here. So I think back to the beginning of March and then to mid-March there was a lot of speculation that people would immediately try to upgrade their digital presence. Well in fact, the reaction was kind of opposite. I don\u2019t want to mess with anything right now. My consumers are all changing their behavior. I just want to leave things alone right now. But now that, that\u2019s settled in, we have a lot of customers realizing that for them to be successful going forward they do have to seriously look at upgrading their digital presence and that\u2019s not just, what we used to call mobile banking, it\u2019s the entire digital banking suite including opening accounts online and so on. So we definitely are seeing a shift in interest to shift in conversation about that as people are thinking about the future and trying to make sure they\u2019re positioned well for the future. And I think there will be more things. Online commercial lending and we\u2019ve talked many times in these calls about the outstanding technology we developed for commercial lending online. We had signed number of banks and some credit unions for that technology. But many of them still view commercial lending as oppose to consumer retail lending. Commercial lending they view it as that, function where somebody has to come into the branch. You can\u2019t possibly do a commercial loan without looking that person in the eye. Well now today guess what, they\u2019re doing lot of commercial lending over the - digitally. And so we have a number of customers looking at upgrading that piece of technology as well. So I think you\u2019re absolutely spot on as we look for the future. Digital will be much more of a topic than it has been. Kevin Williams : And then other thing, I would like to add David obviously as Dave pointed out in his opening comments. We signed 11 additional existing core customers to move from in to out. I think COVID-19 is going to continue if not accelerate that trend somewhat and I think our Hosted Network Services offering will probably grow even faster than it was because I think some of FI\u2019s are realizing that they really don\u2019t want to have to mess with any of the technology than rather us do it. Again that\u2019s prediction on my part. It\u2019s too early to tell, but I have to believe that, that is going to be part of this whole conversation in FY 2021 going forward. David Togut : Thanks for that. Just a follow-up question on capital allocation priorities. Kevin you highlighted the strength of the balance sheet. How are you thinking in this environment about capital deployment when you look at your share price obviously dividends have been a priority for many years and then potential acquisitions to the extent seller expectations have come down versus let\u2019s say six months ago? Kevin Williams : I mean obviously we\u2019re in a very good capital position. As Dave pointed out, we\u2019ve paid dividends for 119 straight quarters. I don\u2019t see us breaking that strength. We have a board meeting next week so at that point we\u2019ll probably be announcing another dividend and of course that\u2019s up to the board, not to me. So dividend is a priority. But you\u2019re absolutely right. We continue to talk to bankers about potential M&A activity out there and we think that there will be some better opportunities later in this calendar year and into next calendar year. In fact, emails from three different bankers this margining. Wanted to call us to talk about potential deals and things, so obviously number priority is continue to look at those acquisitions that give our shareholders a continued strong return. We will continue to increase dividends and we\u2019ll continue to look at buying stock back. I think under the circumstances right now I don\u2019t know that would be viewed. It\u2019s extremely well for us with buying back stock but obviously if there was dip in our stock price, we would probably jump in with both feet. David Togut : Thanks very much, be well. Kevin Williams : Thanks Dave. Operator : Your next question is from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Kevin just to get your perspective. I know in August you\u2019ll provide a lot more about FY 2021 but Dave then you talked a little bit credit card migration and impact on margins. As you look at FY 2021 early on, would you expect non-GAAP operating margins to be flat in FY 2021 or are there headwinds that could prevent that? Kevin Williams : So and again and we\u2019re just working on budgeting quarters at this point, Kartik. So non-GAAP margins in Q1 should be slightly better because of all the software usage and software subscription revenue that gets recognized with very little cost in the first quarter which should be enough to offset the increased cost for the payments migration. After we do the migrations in Q1, we should get some relief I\u2019m not sure exactly right now what that relief will be off the payments migration as we\u2019re able to start shutting some things down. So Q2 you might see a - basically a flat, Q3 we\u2019ll continue to do a little bit because the continued pressure from migration and then we should see a nice pop in margins in Q4, so again we\u2019re still on early budget stages. So what I\u2019m hoping for Kartik is that margins for next fiscal year are at least equal to this year. But again, really too early for me to even make that prediction. Kartik Mehta : No, that\u2019s helpful Kevin. And then Dave, you talked a little bit about one of the things that COVID-19 is bringing is maybe more in-house customers looking and going to outsource. What kind of revenue contribution or growth contribution has that had in the past and it seems like that could help accelerate revenue. So I\u2019m just trying to understand maybe how much of benefit that\u2019s been in the past and what you think it could do as we go in the future. Dave Foss : Thanks Kartik. Essentially when you go from in-house to outsourcing the revenues to Jack Henry is doubled because we\u2019re taking on all the processing responsibility for that customer. I think you could probably figure out that our cost aren\u2019t doubled because we rolled them into an existing infrastructure, so revenue essentially doubles. And usually when we sign a customer go from in-house to host our private cloud environment usually, they also take on other products at the same time. So there\u2019s this add-on effect of them adding products those decisions are easier for them in that environment because there isn\u2019t a capital outlay that usually that decision to add a product doesn\u2019t need to go to the board for approval, they can just add into their monthly fees, so they\u2019re usually pretty comfortable talking about adding things that they wanted to add for a long time. So that move has definitely been a key driver for us in the past and will continue to be for quite some time, even if we speed up the rate of migrations here and we have many, many orders of customer activity in that area before that runs out. So lots of runway up. Kevin Williams : Right now Kartik we\u2019re at 61% of our core customers are currently in our private cloud. So almost 40% of our close to 1,900 core customers are still in-house that has the opportunity to move over. And as far as revenue contribution, in any given quarter a year. I mean if you go back to the last eight or 10 years, I mean we\u2019ve averaged about 45 to 50 a year. But the revenue contribution in any given year can be so significantly different. Based on the size of the institutions that we move in any given quarter or a year. Kartik Mehta : Thanks Kevin and thanks Dave. Really appreciated. Operator : Your next question comes from John Davis with Raymond James. John Davis : Good morning, guys. Glad you\u2019re doing well. Kevin to start off on payment\u2019s business for a second. If you assume Jan, Feb were probably a double-digit growth. I think March probably exited down low-to-mid single digits. We\u2019ve seen any improvement in April and then kind of what\u2019s embedded, you got positive payments growth embedded kind of and the guide for 4Q, any color there would be helpful? Kevin Williams : So for the entire quarter, is it going to some growth? Yes JD but it\u2019s going to be back end loaded in the quarter because April we continue to see some headwinds from lack of usages people were staying at home. I think as now we\u2019re seeing countries partly opened up again so it\u2019s pretty early to tell. But I think we\u2019re going to see some increase in May and then hopefully a decent rebound in June. But it\u2019s not going to be much growth over last year\u2019s number. Dave Foss : I think one important thing to keep in mind here. So that\u2019s focused on our debit business, our card processing business. There are three aspects of our payments business and they include bill pay and our EPS, ACH origination plus Capture business. Both EPS and iPay, our Bill Pay business both are performing well. They did not see a big - they saw a dip for one week, that week in March where you know nobody knew what was going to happen tomorrow. But absent that one week, volumes continue to be up year-over-year. Those are part of the key payments infrastructure not lot of discretion in lot of that stuff, so those continue to be up year-over-year even though there\u2019s this impact on the debit switch [ph]. I think that\u2019s important to keep in mind that helps offset some of the potential challenge in the debit business. John Davis : Okay and then complementary, obviously really strong growth in the quarter significantly better than I thought. Anything to call out and how should we think about the sustainability of that growth which I think heads over depended on double-digits in the third quarter. Kevin Williams : Part of it is, digital. So digital is in that bucket and certainly a big chunk of that was our continued implementation of digital solutions, our treasury management solutions, some of things that we\u2019ve talked about here recently online commercial lending, so a number of those things are in that bucket and we had a strong quarter in all of those areas. Will it be as strong next quarter? I don\u2019t know that I can say that, but it certainly is an area of growth for us and it\u2019s particularly strong area of focus for our customers. So I think you can assume that segment will continue for well. John Davis : Okay, last one from me. I think April to-date I think you decided four competitive takeaways which is not too far off the run rate that you\u2019ve been kind of averaging. But any commentary on what new RFP\u2019s look like because assuming that those competitive takeaways you won in April those were kind of well underway. We started to see RFPs go back out or are banks kind of just hunkering down for the meantime. Dave Foss : Actually I quoted five for the month of April. It\u2019s first time that I ever quoted on an earnings call what\u2019s happening in the current quarter, that we\u2019re talking about, that I thought it was important for you all to know that, sales has really continued to perform well. But to your question, RFPs, we\u2019ve had some RFPs come in, I think it\u2019s logical for you to assume and for anybody to think the RFP volume has slowed down a little bit. But I will tell you that our pipeline has not dropped at all. So what that means is, as you\u2019re booking deals, as deals are getting signed, going out the funnel. There are new opportunities coming in the funnel, so that we ended April with essentially the same size pipeline that we started April with even though the sales team exceeded their quota for the month of April. So I think that\u2019s a good sign, but there are still activity out there. And as I mentioned we have a lot of bankers now that are starting to think more in terms of returning to focusing on the data. I won\u2019t say they\u2019re thinking about returning to normal because they still don\u2019t know, what normal is. But they\u2019re focused on the day-to-day and they\u2019re thinking about things like digital and about Kevin mentioned our HNS, our Hosted Network Solutions service. Things that will help them with the efficiency, things that will help them with expense control. And there is a lot of talk about bankers now focusing on moving to a single source provider which is great news for Jack Henry because we have such a broad suite of solutions and so we believe that may help us pick up some business where customers maybe reusing a small third-party for one piece or 10 pieces of their solution set. Maybe they\u2019ll bring one or two or three of those to us as they\u2019re focused more on minimizing risk and working with a single source provider. So I think there are a lot of things happening right now that bode well for Jack Henry but we need a little more time under our belt here to really say with confidence that the sales process isn\u2019t going to be negatively impacted. Kevin Williams : The other thing I\u2019d point out JD is, obviously back in 2009 which was obviously different times and different circumstances but it was still kind of hailstorm that the financial institutions are going through today. And I would say in 2009 our core system evaluations actually increased from what they were before the financial crisis started. We did have a lag in some of our accounts - many products. But I don\u2019t think we can see that this time because of the increased demand for digital and some of the other things that they mentioned like commercial lending. So I think we continue to be in a very good position to face these challenges going forward. John Davis : Okay, all right, thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann with Davidson. Peter Heckmann : How are you going to handle user conferences, trade shows and how much do those typically contribute to sales of ancillary products? Dave Foss : Yes, so it\u2019s a good question. Actually I\u2019m dressed up today for the first time in six weeks. I\u2019ve actually got a sport coat on because as soon as we end this call. I\u2019m going to go and record a virtual presentation for our first client conference since the pandemic struck. So what we\u2019ve done, we normally host a client conference in April and one in May and the one in May of course normally leads up to the Analyst Conference that we tend to visit with all of you at. Both of them have been turned into a virtual conference and so we have - and these are smaller conference as oppose as to our large conferences at the end of the year. So I think I saw this morning, we have somewhere 400 attendees currently that are registered for this conference. So we\u2019ll be doing that virtually continuing to share information with them virtually. We have the next - our normal, our big annual conferences would be in September and October. We\u2019re still talking about what we\u2019re going to do with those conferences. So will people be comfortable gathering in a large group for an industry conference in September and October, as I sit here right now. I don\u2019t know, so that\u2019s a big topic for us. And as you point out, those are good opportunities from plus on the sale side to share information about product and so on. So we\u2019re doing lot of remote demonstrations today, that sales organization pretty quickly move toward focusing on remote demonstration back in March and so if we\u2019re aren\u2019t able to host large client conferences at the end of the year. I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll be doing virtual conferences and included in those conferences will be opportunities for us to demonstrate solutions. The good news in all of that is, when you do a remote conference, you tend to get a lot more people sign up because there is no travel expense and so it may expose us to more eyeballs than we would in person. But we\u2019re not at that point yet where we\u2019re ready to make that decision. Kevin Williams : Pete, the education conferences we have the big ones for credit unions and then for the JC for bank and ProfitStars. I mean those are truly educational conferences. Is there some sales opportunities from all those? Yes, they serve quite a few leads, typically yes. But those are truly educational conferences and if we do that to go virtual, we\u2019ll still do large education portions of that, for people who want to sign up because that\u2019s what we want to do, to make sure that our customers continue to learn how to better use our products and make their institutions more efficient. Peter Heckmann : Got it, okay and then one other question I had. Just on real-time payments, the release you had out earlier in the week. Can you talk about some of the used cases for real-time payments and what the fees might look like? The bank might charge to the payer and then lastly, what will those payments conditions shared from? Dave Foss : It\u2019s a good question; I think that opportunity is still developing not only for us, but certainly for our customers. I think a lot of our customers aren\u2019t exactly sure yet what the two depths of the opportunities is for them. But all of us, I think our customers and Jack Henry we view the real-time payments opportunity very differently from the Zelle opportunity. So Zelle, real-time P2P but as we\u2019ve stressed many times on these calls. There\u2019s not really much of money making opportunity when it comes to Zelle. It\u2019s hard to make money on free [ph], right so. Zelle has not been in focus as far as the money making opportunity. For real-time payments there definitely is a money making opportunity there because not only will it be used for consumer payments, but we see it being used for commercial payments. So our expectation is, that it will definitely impact check volume because keep in mind today. Most of the paper check volume that\u2019s out there is in business payment, so I think it will play a role when it comes check volume. I think it will play a role in displacing ACH transactions that are happening out there today. So that is an opportunity as far as we\u2019re concerned. And then card maybe but I think it\u2019s much more likely to replace ACH and current paper check as through real-time payments start to rollout. Peter Heckmann : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks Dave. Operator : Your next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Dave Koning : I guess first of all, just a follow-up kind of my Kartik\u2019s question. When you talked about margins, was that all kind of ex-term fees when you said you expected up somewhat in fiscal 2021, was that ex-term fees and including term fees? I would imagine it might be down a little just given you at the big term fee this quarter. Kevin Williams : That would be true. Yes. Dave Koning : Okay and I guess one other one just on margins. We can see the margins coming down a little bit obviously with the implementation and all. Is there [indiscernible] like low term fees, take out all implementation stuff, are the core margins still going higher and what\u2019s driving that just core revenue growth? Kevin Williams : So you kind of cut out there, Dave. So to recap I think, what\u2019s driving the core revenue growth and offsetting the negative payments is that right? Dave Koning : Yes, I was just trying to understand to make sure that core margins are still going up when you exclude all the one-off stuff. Kevin Williams : I mean you can look at just the segments and yes, the both GAAP and non-GAAP went up through the quarter on margins for payments and complementary and obviously the big driver that is to continued growth and into outlook [ph] like I said in my opening comments. Our hosted and cloud services was up 18%, this quarter over a year ago and that\u2019s still double digits. I think on a non-GAAP basis we\u2019re still like 12% or 13% for the year. So that\u2019s been the same for the last three or four years. I don\u2019t see that changing going forward or even into next year. Complementary continues to be driven by a lot of our private cloud products like digital and other things. But lot of other products that are added into our private cloud core customer. So both of those segments grew nicely and essentially offset the decrease and margins in the payments segment. Dave Koning : Yes, got you. Okay. That\u2019s helpful and then finally, is there any big difference between like what your core clients are doing in an environment like this relative to your like ProfitStars clients like is there at all divergence and kind of how you see activity over the next couple quarters, one growing a lot faster than the other or is it just all pretty goods though? Dave Foss : No I would say it\u2019s all, there\u2019s no difference between core and ProfitStars as far as sales success or what we\u2019re seeing. So I emphasize the core deals that we\u2019ve done in April just because I knew they would be on your [ph] all minds wondering whether that big revenue driver is totally stopped. But no ProfitStars performed really well in April and has continued and about the same pace. Dave Koning : All right, stay well and great job. Operator : [Operator Instructions] your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens, Inc. Brett Huff : I\u2019m glad everybody at Jack Henry is doing okay and thanks for the questions. First one is, both of you mentioned I think the relative optimism of banks. I think probably relatively better than me and many on this call would have assumed. Is there something unique about the group that you hear more optimism from? Are their balance sheet different? Are they different sized? Are they different focus things more commercial or less commercial or is it fairly broad-based? Dave Foss : I\u2019d say it\u2019s fairly broad-based. I tend to talk to CEOs, banks and credits that are on the larger side of our base. So we\u2019ll say our largest customers today run up in the $30 billion space and it\u2019s rare for me to talk to a CEO of the financial institution that\u2019s $250 million. It\u2019s much more common for me to talk to somebody who is in the billion range and I think the consistent theme there is, what I emphasized earlier that they feel strongly that their balance sheet is strong, they\u2019re well capitalized, they haven\u2019t taken on risky loans. Yes, they have deals they\u2019re going to work through with their customers. But the PPP program many of them have gotten into that in a big way and the PPP program includes a forgiveness component which we\u2019ll be working on with a lot of our customers going forward. And they tend to know their customers and so they know that the - what their situation is and their ability to work through these things overtime. Now they can\u2019t predict the future any better than you or I. But I think they\u2019re generally, fairly optimistic that they\u2019ll be able to weather this storm and be okay because they know about the strength of their balance sheet and the strength of their overall portfolio. Kevin Williams : And the other thing remember Brett, I mean net interest margins actually went I mean they\u2019re essentially back to where they were three years ago and they weather that storm by figuring out a way to get non-interest fee income and different thing, so I mean it\u2019s basically pulled off a play book that they were using three years ago. Brett Huff : That\u2019s helpful. And then just in terms of digital usage. You talked about a pause in evaluation of digital products. I think that you said for a week or two and then, the conversations resume which is a good sign. But we\u2019ve gotten a lot of questions on actual usage. So I guess sort of same store users with a typical bank X, Y, Z that might have 5,000 Banno or NetTeller whatever the products they\u2019re using, goDough. Did that go up meaningfully as folks got more fearful of going into a branch? I mean did you see absolute number of user\u2019s spike? Dave Foss : The number of users went up for sure. I don\u2019t have those numbers in front of me. But the number of active users went up significantly. The thing that was really startling to me was - we enter this period of pandemic and everybody is staying home and so the number of registered active user\u2019s volume went up. Over the first couple of weeks there was about 40% increase in volume of transactions. The thing that caught me off guard thankfully our team was ready for it. When the stimulus check started to come out, so that Monday and April, whatever that Monday was. On that single day, we saw 63% spike in usage in people hitting their account as compared to the prior week and that week had been up, as I mentioned earlier over weeks prior to that. So what people were doing, was they go on and see if my stimulus check there yet, no. and then five minutes later, is my stimulus there, no. is my stimulus check there? Every five minutes they were hitting their accounts, so volumes just went through the roof. So it wasn\u2019t that all of sudden there were a whole bunch of new active users. It was people just over and over checking to see if they had their stimulus check deposited, that\u2019s all settled down now. But the true run rate per day is up like I say roughly 40% over what we saw before all of this started. Brett Huff : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Always appreciate the insight guys. Be safe. Operator : [Operator Instructions] your next question comes from Tim Willi with Wells Fargo. Tim Willi : Just one question I had, regarding I guess digital and spending by the banks. I guess there\u2019s always been a long debate about, are the bigger banks winning because they have these large budgets for their own discretionary investment and strategies. The counter argument has always been the people like yourself are able to arm the mid-to-small size banks to be just as effective as those large ones. And I guess given again sort of the acceleration and the technology curve that\u2019s happened over the last couple of years. Could you just sort of egress your thoughts about where sort of your core customer base is competitively? And then to the extent that you\u2019re actually sort of keep an eye on fundamentally because a lot of them are private entities as opposed to public? Is there actually quantifiable evidence when you look at their deposit growth, their loan growth, that shows that yes absolutely by working with people like yourself or your competitors, these mid-to-small size institutions are actually very competitive in performing versus the big monolithic entities that get a lot of their airtimes obviously NBC [ph] etc. about their technology investments and I had a quick follow-up. Dave Foss : You packed a lot into that question, Tim. So I may talk for about hour and half here to answer your question. Well I\u2019ll try and do it in a concise manner. So first off, you\u2019re right major players are spending a lot when it comes to technology and it\u2019s been lot on digital. I would challenge your statement about us trying to position our banks to offer the same service as those banks that is not what we are doing. We have been very I think thoughtful in the way we designed our digital solutions to offer a competitive edge to our customers as compared to those solutions, in the functionality. The functionality is just different and I won\u2019t go through all the puts and takes here, but I feel very strongly that we\u2019ve created a better solution because we know that for our customers, for our banks and credit unions to differentiate against those players in a digital world when that whole aspect of walking into the branch and smiling face across the teller line is not there anymore. And the technology has to help you differentiate and we\u2019ve done that with our solutions. So we believe strongly that we\u2019ve delivered something that truly is a differentiator. Our customers I don\u2019t know that we have customers who can say if you will on the loan growth side. We can point to the digital presence. I believe that\u2019s there. But I don\u2019t - and people are tracking as much as on the deposit growth side and we have number of customers who absolutely can point to the digital platform as providing new opportunities for them to grab customer growth and overall deposit growth through that channel. So there\u2019s anecdotal evidence and you\u2019ll see more and more press releases and marketing releases from us on those types of topics. As we continue to see more. One of our customers who is kind of power user of the Banno suite recently did a podcast with the ABA and emphasized how significant the opportunity has been for them. It\u2019s a large about $25 billion, bank. I think $20 billion bank. They did a podcast with the ABA and this was a key part of their discussion. So this solution has differentiated them in this world of digital. So like I said, I can talk all day but that\u2019s kind of the short answer to your question. As short as I can make it. Tim Willi : Yes, thank you. And quick follow-up just on M&A, but more from a perspective of your customers. So you\u2019ve also overtime sort of showed that the sweet spot of your customer base, probably are more likely to be acquirers of the low end or sort of MOE situations where your customers tend to get larger, theoretically you\u2019ll lose one, they get sold. I\u2019m just sort of curios when you - are your bankers, were they in the mode of 10 years and do a recovery prior COVID in a mode of looking to do M&A as they\u2019d rebuild their balance sheets and move forward. And again just sort of assuming that mentality will come back as we sort of come through this period of time. Did you feel as if your customers were out on - out looking for deals and M&A to build their own franchises, had that changed at all? Dave Foss : So you\u2019re right, many of them were active in M&A. in fact a little while I ago I referenced the fact that we did three core conversions on one weekend. One of those was a brand new quarter Jack Henry that was converted, but two of them were existing customers converting acquired institutions into their bank. And so our customers were definitely on the M&A track acquiring other institutions prior to COVID-19. I\u2019ll be honest with you. I haven\u2019t heard anybody one way or the other, say whether they thought this was going to provide an opportunity for them or if they were going to - this was really going to put them off of the idea of doing more M&A, have not had those conversations. Everything I\u2019ve been talking to people about has been the future as far as their balance sheet and their interaction with their customers and that kind of thing. But I would expect that once recovery starts to happen. Those bankers will be out looking for acquisitions just like we are today actively looking for acquisitions. They\u2019ll be looking to see if there are opportunities. Tim Willi : Great, thanks very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] there are no additional questions at this time. Sir, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you for closing remarks. Kevin Williams : Thanks Stephanie. Thanks for joining us today.

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Williams. Thank you. Please, go ahead, sir. Kevin Williams : Thank you, Gigi. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry & Associates fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2020 earnings call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer. And on the call with me today is David Foss, our President and CEO. In just a minute, I'll turn the call over to Dave, so he can provide some of his thoughts about the state of our business, the performance for the quarter and fiscal year, as well as some comments relating to the impacts of COVID-19 and some other key initiatives that we have in place. And then after that, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market close and provide comments regarding our guidance for our fiscal year 2021 provided in the release and then open the lines for Q&A. First, I need to remind you that this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found in yesterday's press release. With that, I will now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our fourth quarter and for the entire fiscal year, particularly in light of the challenges posed by conducting business in the midst of a global pandemic. Before we get into the discussion of our results for the quarter and the full year, I think, it's appropriate to review some of the ongoing impacts we're seeing as a result of the pandemic. We remain extremely thankful for the fact that very few of our almost 7,000 employees or their family members have been directly affected by the COVID-19 virus. Our HR and benefits teams are working closely with all the groups around our company to be sure anyone who is affected is receiving the care and accommodations they require. We continue to operate with well over 90% of our employees working full-time remote and have recently extended our return-to-office state to January 4 of next year. We extended that date for a couple of key reasons. First, we have a strong commitment at Jack Henry to put our associates first as we make key decisions about how we run the company. With all the concerns expressed by our teams about returning to an office environment and with so many members of the Jack Henry team struggling to make plans for their school-aged children in the fall, we decided to remove the worry for our employees by extending the date. And second, we have had great success in all areas of our business adapting to a work-from-home status and we see no reason why that can't and won't continue, so the decision was easier than you might otherwise think. Speaking of our success working from home, we are now several months into working with a modified set of processes for many of our groups. We are routinely doing sales presentations and executing contracts with no on-site presence at the customer location. We have completed many 100% remote implementations with great success, including several full core conversions. And our customer service teams continue to deliver outstanding service through remote channels, while keeping our customer satisfaction ratings at an even higher level than they were before the pandemic. I continue to be amazed and impressed by the adaptability and commitment of our team members throughout our organization. They continue to execute in this new environment, with the success of the customer always foremost in their mind. As I mentioned on the last call, many of you have commented in the past about the unique culture at Jack Henry, a culture built on the do the right thing and do whatever it takes mantra. Never has that culture been on display in a more meaningful way than what we've witnessed during this pandemic. I'm extremely proud of our team and their ongoing commitment to our customers and our company.  With that, let's shift our focus to a look at our performance for the quarter we completed in June. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, total revenue increased 4% for the quarter and increased 4% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were up just slightly over the prior year quarter, but down significantly as compared to our fiscal third quarter. Turning to the segments. We had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 4% for the quarter and also increased by 4% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment also performed well posting a 3% increase in revenue this quarter and a 3% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We had a very strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses with a 9% increase in revenue this quarter and a 6% increase on a non-GAAP basis. As I highlighted in our press release, despite the obvious COVID-19-related challenges for the sales team, June was the strongest sales month in the history of the company and the fourth quarter was our strongest sales quarter ever. All three sales groups exceeded their quota for the full year and for the quarter. This is remarkable to me because we made no adjustments to quotas for our sales teams as a result of any COVID-19 expected impacts. In the fourth fiscal quarter, we booked seven competitive core takeaways and nine deals to move existing in-house customers to our private cloud environment. Several of our complementary offerings saw very strong demand in the quarter with as you might guess, our digital suite leading the pack. We signed 53 new clients to our Banno Digital platform in the quarter and we signed 13 new clients to our new Card Processing Solution. For the full year then, we signed 43 competitive core takeaways with six of them greater than 1 billion in assets and six de novo banks. Additionally, we signed 45 contracts to move in-house core clients to our private cloud, 167 new Banno Digital customers, and 81 new clients for our Card Processing Solution. Of course, we signed a myriad of other contracts for many of our other solutions as well, but it's important to note that almost all of these contracts represent long-term recurring revenue commitments to Jack Henry for a wide variety of our solutions. Speaking of our new card processing platform, on the last call I pointed out that prior to the onset of COVID-19, we were poised to wrap the migration of our core clients by June 30 and had all 136 of those clients scheduled to convert in April, May, and June. In early April, however, several of the clients on those lists asked us to delay the schedule because they had minimized their employee presence in their offices and didn't want to introduce any new payment solutions while their employees and customers were working remote. As disappointed as we were to introduce a delay in a project that has been moving along so well, we determined it was definitely the right thing to do. In July, however, we resumed the migration process and now expect to have all of our core customers migrated by the end of the current quarter, and all of our noncore clients completed by the end of our third fiscal quarter. We are prepared and anxious to wrap these migrations and expect no further delays from our customers. One topic I haven't discussed previously on these calls is all the work we've been doing in the area of diversity and inclusion for the past several years. In the spirit of doing the right thing and attempting to always put our associates first, we formally launched our D&I program more than two years ago with a variety of training initiatives followed by the launch of our first business innovation group. We added a full-time diversity leader to our team more than a year ago and we now support five very active and successful business innovation groups within the company. Our D&I team provides ongoing training, they facilitate panel discussions and work with the Jack Henry leadership team to ensure that our work environment provides a safe space for our employees to thrive. Given all the social unrest in our country today, I am particularly grateful to our team for the outstanding progress and long list of successes we've seen with this program so far. As you have undoubtedly noted from the press release, we have decided that we will stick with past practice and provide guidance for the new fiscal year at the conclusion of today's call. As we've discussed in the past, although our business model is not impervious to impacts from the current economic environment, it is resistant to significant swings caused by economic disruption. After much discussion and despite the obvious challenges in trying to predict the future in the midst of a global pandemic, we believe we have enough information to provide reasonable insights and assumptions and sharing that information with you today is the right thing to do. As I reflect back on fiscal 2020, even with the extraordinary challenges in the environment at the close of our fiscal year, I view it as a very good year for our company. We have made great strides with our diversity and inclusion initiatives and our employee engagement scores remain very high. Our levels of customer engagement and customer satisfaction scores are also very high. Our sales teams are performing extremely well and have positioned us for another successful year of selling and overall demand for Jack Henry technology solutions remains high in all segments of our business. As we move forward, we will continue to implement minor changes to our delivery and service models and we have every expectation that we will end next calendar year with a greater percentage of full-time work from home employees than we had before the pandemic. We have a commitment to doing the right thing for our constituents that we believe will serve us well as we adjust to the new normal. We will continue with our disciplined approach to running the company and expect that approach to help provide stability for our employees, customers and shareholders. As we begin the new fiscal year, I continue to be very optimistic about our future. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Dave. Appreciate it. The service and support line of revenue, which is made up of two product groups, which are outsourcing and cloud and product delivery and services increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Outsourcing cloud services within our private cloud were again the big driver in this line of revenue with an increase of 13% compared to the same quarter a year ago, and an increase of 14% for the entire fiscal year. The headwind on this line of revenue in the quarter were decreases within the product delivery and services license, hardware implementation services and pass-through costs, primarily related to billing for our implementation teams' travel decreased a total of $7.4 million compared to the prior year quarter. This was partially offset by a small increase in deconversion fees as Dave pointed out, which is included in this line during the quarter of $845,000. The processing line of revenue, which is our remittance in card, and our transaction in digital lines of revenue grew 7% to the prior year quarter and increased 9% for the fiscal year. Within this line though remittance and card processing only grew a little over 2% in the quarter compared to last year, due to the impacts of COVID-19 in Q4 of this fiscal year, which for comparison remittance and card was growing 9% through the first three quarters of the year compared to the prior year compared to only 2% for Q4. However, this headwind was mostly offset by continued strong growth in our transaction and digital revenue during the quarter, which was impacted positive by the CARES Act and related legislative changes and grew 16% for the fiscal year. Total revenue was up 4% for the quarter compared to last year on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Our cost of revenue was up 6%, compared to last year's fourth quarter, but on a sequential basis compared to Q3 cost of revenue was actually down, due primarily to lower cost of hardware and travel-related expenses compared to the previous year quarter. Research and development was up 20% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to increased personnel costs. And sequentially, R&D was up a little more than 3% again primarily due to personnel costs in Q4. SG&A was essentially flat compared to the prior year fourth quarter, and down a little over 3% sequentially, again, primarily due to travel-related expenses. Total expense was up 6%, compared to a year ago quarter but compared to Q3 sequentially it was actually down a little over 1%, again, primarily due to lower cost of hardware sold and lower travel-related expenses as our employees were mostly working from home. Our reported consolidated operating margins decreased from 20.2% last year to 18.7%, which this decrease is primarily due to the various revenue headwinds already discussed and the increased cost. On a non-GAAP basis our operating margins decreased from 18.9% last year to 17.8% this year, again, primarily due to items already mentioned. Our payments segment continues to be impacted by the additional cost related to our card processing platform migration as Dave discussed in his opening comments. Our core segment operating margins improved slightly during the quarter, compared to last year while complementary segment margins were down just slightly. The effective tax rate for the quarter decreased to 20% this year compared to 23% last year. The quarter-over-quarter difference is primarily related to changes in our effective and deferred state tax rate as we re-measure our state estimated rate when we file our state tax returns in Q4 and perform a return to provision true-up. Last year, we had an unfavorable impact in Q4 of about 1.5% and due to some effective tax planning by our tax department over the year, we had a favorable impact this year of approximately 1.5% to give you the 3% difference compared to last year. Net income was $61.3 million for the fourth quarter compared to $61.0 million last year and earnings per share was $0.80 this year compared to $0.79 last year.  Some comments on cash flow. Our total amortization increased 5% for the year compared to last year due to capitalized projects being placed into service. Included in the total amortization of intangibles is related to acquisitions which decreased to $20.3 million year-to-date this fiscal year compared to $20.8 million last year.  Depreciation was up a little over 10% for the fiscal year, primarily due to CapEx increases in the previous year and those assets being placed into service and receiving a full year depreciation this year, while this year's total CapEx spend was basically flat with last fiscal year's total spend.  Our operating cash flow was $510.5 million for the fiscal year, which was up nicely from $431.1 million or 18% compared to last fiscal year. During the year, we invested $177.5 million back into our company through capital expenditures and capitalized software from developing additional products and enhancements, which the total amount capitalized is up 4% from $170.8 million spent a year ago.  Our free cash flow which is operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software and then adding back net proceeds from sale of assets was $344.2 million which compared to net income means that we had a conversion of free cash flow to net income for the year of 116%. A couple of comments on our balance sheet as of June 30th. We were in a cash position of $213.3 million up from $93 million a year ago. And remember in February, we increased the max in borrowings on our $700 million line of credit. And as of June 30th, there was nothing drawn on that line and we had no other long-term debt on our balance sheet other than leases which obviously increased this year significantly due to the adoption of ASC 842 last July 1st, which means we had to put the operating leases on our balance sheet.  Some comments about the guidance we provided in the press release yesterday. As you noticed, we did provide both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance in the press release. Just to be clear this guidance is based on the assumption that the country continues to open up, the economy continues to improve. And obviously, if the country is forced to be shut down again due to COVID-19 and the economy stalls or actually reverses then obviously this guidance will require to be revised.  You will also note that our GAAP guidance that we're forecasting revenue from deconversions to be down $33 million from what we saw in FY '20, which during FY '20, we had $53.9 million of deconversion revenue.  Currently, we see no to little M&A activity that would drive deconversion revenue at this point, which in the short-term, this will hurt our revenue growth, but in the long-term as Dave and I have always said, we don't really like deconversion revenue as we would much rather keep the customer and the revenue for the future. This means based on the GAAP revenue guidance provided in the press release impacted by the decreased deconversion fees, we're looking at GAAP revenue growth of 3% to slightly above 4%.  Since our single acquisition last year, which was Geezeo anniversaried on July 1st, the only adjustment between GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance is the decrease in deconversion fees. Obviously, if we see changes during the year and anticipate deconversion revenue, we will update you on future earnings calls.  Obviously, we were impacted by COVID-19 just like everybody else especially in Q4 of FY '20 as highlighted in our comments about card growth and product delivery and we expect to continue to have some headwinds on revenue, especially in the first half of the year for several reasons. Some ongoing delayed implementations at customers' request, the continued shift of our customers to our private cloud will continue to put additional headwinds on our license, hardware and on-prem implementation. And our annual education conferences will now be virtual events this year, which will also impact revenue in the first half of the year. Not much impact on operating income, but it will have an impact on revenue. Therefore for your models for non-GAAP, again non-GAAP revenue growth, I would suggest using 3% to 5% revenue growth in the first half of the year and somewhere in the 6% to 8% range growth in the second half to get you to our guidance of 5.5% to 6.5% growth for the entire fiscal year non-GAAP revenue.  We anticipate GAAP operating margins for all of FY '21 to be down slightly to 20% to 21% for all of the reasons previously discussed. However, as we complete the migrations in the new payment platform during the fiscal year, we will see margin improvement in fiscal Q4 as we have guided previously. Our effective tax rate for FY '21 should be in line with FY '20 and be somewhere between 22% and 22.5%. That concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions. Gigi will you please open the call lines up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Peter Heckmann :   Hey good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Dave, could you maybe try and quantify if you could year-over-year bookings growth? And then maybe talk about the current backlog and compare it to prior years in terms of the -- had the implementation delays resulted in a larger-than-normal backlog? David Foss : Yes. So thanks Pete. We of course don't discuss the details of the backlog but just to kind of give you some high-level expectation. So there have been some delays, but it's not hugely significant. It's just people moving things around. And so normally if we have a customer who says, we want to delay this implementation we go find another customer who wants to move up in the schedule. So it's created lumpiness in the schedule for the implementation operations groups, but it's not as though there's major push to move things out. It's more the inconvenience and the inefficiency and moving things around a little bit is the way I would characterize the delays as far as install are concerned. To the first part of your question on sales, so you'll note we've been running at a pace of one new competitive core takeaway per week for two and a half to three years and that part has slowed down a little bit. So our sales aren't as -- weren't as dependent on new core takeaway -- competitive core takeaways as they have been in the past. But what was really fascinating to me, I guess, was that the other product groups not only filled in that gap but exceeded any other sales month and any other sales quarter that we've ever had. And so what were those things? Well I highlighted a few of them. We've continued to have really good success with the new payments platform. We've sold a whole bunch of the Banno Digital platform which as I highlighted in my opening comments probably is not a shocker to anybody, but really great traction there. We've been -- we've seen a number of in out -- in-house to outsource conversions that have been signed in the quarter. So -- and then a whole bunch of other things online lending and just a wide variety of products. So the thing I would highlight is the fact that even though the new core sales slowed and it's just the industry that slowed because people were not making as many of those decisions, so even though that slowed the sales teams filled in with all kinds of other sales of all kinds of other products. And so now those backlogs are robust. I'm not worried about them. It's not that we can't handle the installs, but those have kind of filled in around where we would have signed more new core takeaways. Peter Heckmann : Got you got you. And then that leads to my second question. I think last quarter you had said you had signed 5 core takeaways in April and so that would indicate just 2 in May and June and that just might be situational. But in terms of how the relative profitability and outlook for financial institutions has changed because of the pandemic and lower rates, how do you see that affecting overall IT spending amongst banks and credit unions over the next year? David Foss : Yes. So the good news for us first off the pipeline is after a record month and record quarter, we just did a sales -- a review with the sales leadership team on Monday of this week, and the pipeline is filling back up again which -- that's always a concern, when you have a blowout month and a blowout quarter, and then you've got to go fill the pipe again with new opportunities. So the pipeline is filling again had a big month in July as far as new opportunities that are going back into the pipeline. I'll add to that that the American Banker published a survey about a month ago probably, but it was a post-COVID survey of CEOs talking about technology spending, and there is no slowdown in their minds regarding their plans for technology spending. They may have shifted a little bit to thinking about things that we can do without everybody in the office and how do I live in a world where not all of my customers are coming to the branch, as often as they used to. Those types of things are top of their list more than they were before probably. But no slowdown in spending as compared to the pre-COVID numbers which is what we were looking for was compare what our bankers are saying and credit union executives are saying post-COVID as compared to what they were saying back in December and there was absolutely no slowdown in their expectation of spending. And we're seeing that now. So, now that everything is kind of settled back in, we saw a big influx of RFPs. For example, in July particularly in the banking group people kind of settled in they've kind of put the brakes on a little bit, but how they've settled in and decided, okay, we've got to get back to reviewing technology now that we understand how dependent we're going to be on technology going forward, and so big influx in RFPs and we're excited about that for new core competitive takeaways. A reminder on the core deals is those are very long sales cycles, right? So all these RFPs that came in in July, we won't report any of those wins probably for 9 months to 12 months because they're long sales cycles, but it's really heartening to see the industry getting back to focusing on evaluating technology and making those decisions even the major decisions like core replacement. Peter Heckmann : Good. Good. That\u2019s good to hear. Thanks for the update. David Foss : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Kartik Mehta : Hey. Good morning. Dave, you know, one of the concerns around banks is that all of a sudden you're going to have a lot of loan losses and that could just put pressure on the P&L statement. And I'm wondering if your customers have shown any concern related to that and if that's impacting any budgets. I know you said they're continuing to spend and it sounds like they're spending even more next -- in 2021 versus 2020, but I'm just wondering any level of concern on loan losses? David Foss : Well, you'd have to be living in a cave to not have any concern probably, but it's not an overriding theme with our customers. They're not pulling in saying, oh, my gosh. I've got some real balance sheet risk here that I've got a -- that I've got to hunker down and can't do anything. So it's the opposite. We are seeing a tremendous amount of interest on the sales side. And I will tell you in two weeks, I think, it is I'll be hosting a whole bunch of credit union CEOs exclusive event for credit union CEOs and that will be one of the topics. And then about a month after that we'll do an -- and it'll be a virtual event. A month after that I'll do the same thing with banking CEOs so the only CEOs and that will be a topic. So I'll have a lot of group input on that topic. But anecdotally no \u2013 no major shifts and no major expression of concern. But like I said you'd have to be living in a cave not to have some level of concern about what's going on. But we don't see any slowdown right now from our customers. Kevin Williams : Kartik, so I've talked to a few bankers and I will add this one thing that the ones I talked to really beefed up their loan loss reserve at the end of the March quarter in anticipation of this. So I think a lot -- majority of the P&L impact is already flushed through the P&L. David Foss : That's a great point. I've highlighted before the whole CECL thing all these bankers were so frustrated with CECL. Well CECL did them a great service. Now they -- them really getting focused on projecting credit losses has really done them as service in these difficult times. So as much as they were irritated with CECL a couple of years ago I think they're thankful that they went through all that stuff as Kevin has highlighted. Kartik Mehta : That makes sense. Dave, I think, you and Kevin both mentioned interest in your private cloud and I'm wondering is there are your banks showing an interest for them wanting to go to the Amazon Web Services to outsource to that type of platform? David Foss : It comes up rarely, but it's not most banks and credit unions still traditional banks and credit unions I'm not talking about the online-only banks the neo banks, but traditional banks and credit unions are still pretty wary of putting everything out in a public cloud environment. So we have some of our solutions today in a public cloud environment but not the core kind of the crown jewels piece. That's still -- not a lot of demand for that. We talk about it with our customers and we're very active in that space with other products. And we have a lot of things in the works as far as core is concerned, but not demand today for that. Kartik Mehta : And Kevin just one last question. You talked about deconversion fees of about $33 million. Any thoughts on maybe just how it would go each quarter just so that -- I don't know if there's any lumpiness or you think just straight lining is good enough right now? Kevin Williams : Yes. So Kartik, I mean, last year and again, deconversion fees is something that we -- it's very hard to predict. I mean, typically by this time on an earnings call in mid-August we have an idea of what's going to happen at least in this quarter and we typically have an idea of next quarter. And I mean, right now, I mean, the pipeline is just pretty empty. And as a reminder last year, we had four large customers that got acquired which those four customers were about equal to the decrease in the deconversion fees we're predicting this year. So if you take the adjusted $21 million deconversion revenue that -- and again, we had no idea where that's coming from, but we have to put something in the forecast, because we know there will be some. I would say, probably just put that in pretty much straight line and you're not going to miss it by much Kartik. Kartik Mehta : All right. Well, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Kevin Williams : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Davis from Raymond James. Your line is now open. John Davis : Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Kevin just one quick clarification on the EPS guidance. So assuming flat year-over-year term fees, you would have guided to something in the $403 million to $408 million range. I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything there. Kevin Williams : That's absolutely correct John. John Davis : Okay. And then as I think about the COVID impact, I appreciate your commentary on the first half of the year call it, 3% to 5% back out 6% to 8%. So if I run that out, is it fair to say that COVID based on what you know today is one point to 1.5 points impact to non-GAAP revenue growth in 2021. Kevin Williams : Yeah. Yeah. That's probably pretty close to right. John Davis : All right. And then on -- I want to talk a little bit about the impact on the financials of the shift to cloud. I know it's 2.5 times more profitable over life of the contract. Were there any near-term revenue headwinds from kind of that shift to the cloud? I know there's been an uptick in demand for outsourcing, and then just curious if it's a near-term revenue headwind from lower license sales or how that kind of flows through the P&L. Kevin Williams : Well, it's license hardware on-prem. So if you think about John, so license and hardware this year created a $4.5 million headwind not even counting the pass-throughs and different things, so that was for the year. Obviously, the biggest chunk of that was in Q4, but that was a headwind and that's very similar to the headwind we saw in the past three years as we continue to shift 45 to 50 existing in-house customers to our private cloud each year. We will continue to sell less and less add-on license products and hardware upgrades as they make that move. So we're continuing to add recurring revenue. And you're right, it's literally two times the revenue we're getting from it or more, but you don't get that the big bump in license revenues when you sell a nice complementary product in a license environment. So we're going to continue to have the $4 million to $6 million headwind again next year on our product delivery line. John Davis : Okay. That's helpful. And then lastly I just wanted to hit on the margin. I think last quarter you guys commented you expect that the adjusted operating margin to kind of be flat to slightly up. It looks like guidance implies it's going to be down call it 25 to 30 basis points. First, is that correct? And what's driving the change? And maybe is there an added layer of conservatism given the macro backdrop? That's it for me. Kevin Williams : That is correct, John. And it's primarily all going to be in the first half of the year. Again, we still got the additional cost from the additional payment platform until we get through the first quarter. So we set up those additional costs. Plus the delayed license implementations and some hardware deliveries that we anticipate going to be in the first quarter and some in the second quarter, that's all going to have some negative margin impact in the first half of the year. But I -- but we anticipate margin improvement in the second half of the year. Best case scenario, I think, we could wind up flat for the year, but we're trying to be a little conservative and guide down just slightly. John Davis : Okay. Thanks guys. Kevin Williams : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vasu Govil from KBW. Your line is now open. Vasu Govil : Thank you. Thanks for taking my question, and nice to talk to you guys. I guess just first Kevin, thank you for the color on the quarterly cadence on revenue growth. Could you also tell us what's embedded in the guide in terms of segment-wise expectation in terms of core payments and complementary segments where you're expecting most of the impact from COVID to show through? Kevin Williams : So most of it will probably be in the complementary line if I was guessing. Well, actually core and complementary, because it's going to delay some implementations, especially the few in-house implementations we have out there. Payments -- and Dave commented, payments is kind of back to where we were pre-COVID. So, unless there's another flare from COVID-19 and they start shutting the economy back down, I don't think you're going to see the impact on the payments line. I guess it's going to be another two segments. Vasu Govil : Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, Dave, you sort of made some comments on what success you guys have had working remotely, and some of these practices could continue longer term. Do you think there's potential for some cost saves down the line as a result of this? David Foss : For sure, yes. So, a few things to keep in mind there. And my expectation is not that we will do every install for every product as a remote install going forward. That's not what our customers want. That's not the most efficient way in some regards to do implementation. So, it'll end up being a mix. I think the things that work really well, remote we will continue to do really well. The things that are a little awkward doing remote, we'll go back to having people on-site for those things. But that introduces efficiency. And when you have efficiency, then in theory, you probably don't need as many people. We won't have to add as many people as we look forward into the future for some of those things, because we'll have more efficient process. There is travel. So there's not only the dollar expense involved in travel, but the wear and tear on people that are traveling to do those implementations. And so -- and there's the facility cost. If we can do some of these things and if we have employees who want to continue working from home, as opposed to working remote in and off, meaning doing an implementation for a customer, but doing it from the office. If we continue to do that from home, there is a potential that we will need less office space. And we're examining that. I alluded to it in my opening comments. We're examining, what will the future look like for Jack Henry as far as office space requirements. We currently have 42 locations around the country. We need all those. So, there are a lot of those things that are in-flight for us that are kind of rolled up into that question. I can't tell you exactly what those will be today, but there absolutely will be savings in that in the long run. Vasu Govil : Great, thank you very much. David Foss : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Josh Siegler : Hello. This is Josh Siegler on behalf of David Togut. Good morning. Can you please discuss your top areas of investment in FY 2021? You mentioned digital platforms in your press release. Can you discuss what investments need to be done in digital? David Foss : Sure. It's a big topic. Digital it's not that we're lacking anything. Our Banno Digital Platform is leading the industry as far as feature function is concerned, but we're continuing to build that out. So, expanding as far as business functionality on that platform is a key area of focus for us this year, and just continuing to broaden the offering. We're integrating in the Geezeo personal financial management platform. We are doing online account opening through that platform. There's lots of things that we're just continuing to integrate, and make sure that the consumer -- so the bank's customer, our credit union customer, make sure the consumer has a consistent user experience across all those different functions through the single digital channel. So that is definitely a big area of focus for us. But then beyond that, we're constantly investing in our core solutions where our two flagship cores emphasis on the credit union side and Silver Lake on the banking side. We continue to do a lot of investment in both of those products as our flagships. We also invest in our other legacy cores, but those are areas of focus. Our treasury management solution, we've talked about a lot on this call. Lots of demand for that solution, a lot of growth in that area, but we have to continue to enhance that solution as you get more sophisticated customers taking that platform. We're not done with the migration to the new card processing platform, so that's included in that number. And then online lending, so we've talked a lot on this call about our Commercial Lending Center suite competes, wins regularly by the way against nCino. And you've all seen the nCino, IPO that happened recently. Our Commercial Lending Center suite wins regularly in those deals, but we have to continue to invest in that platform to stay ahead of the game there. So, a number of things. And the other -- the last area I would highlight is fraud, so a lot of demand among our customers. We have our Yellow Hammer fraud solution that we're really focused on this year making that -- ensuring that that's a best-of-breed fraud solution. So, those are relatively short list of a very long list of things that we're continuing to invest in. Josh Siegler : Great. Thank you. Appreciate the color. Can you please help quantify the revenue and earnings benefit from the Paycheck Protection Program from your lending solutions in 4Q? David Foss : So you're talking about a P&L benefit to Jack Henry? Or you're talking about for our customers. Josh Siegler : Sorry, for Jack Henry. David Foss : It was relatively minor dollar amount. We didn't sell license fees. We -- what we did was we stood up a platform to provide that solution to our customers. By the way we were live before the SBA was ready to fund any loans we're pretty proud of that because most platforms were not live before the SBA. But we were up and running and live before the SBA was ready to fund loans. And so what we did was we charged customers on a consumption basis but it wasn't a huge needle mover for Jack Henry. I don't know what the number was. But it was a consumption model where if you decided to do one loan, you will only pay the little fee for that one loan. And if you did 2,000 loans you paid something for every one of those 2,000 loans just a quick charge for each loan that you funded through the platform. There is no ongoing charge for our customers. There is no maintenance. It's not something they're obligated to pay us for ongoing. It was just us trying to do the right thing to help them serve their customers in that moment of need. Kevin Williams : Like I said in my opening comments, it did help our transaction in digital during the quarter and helped to offset some of the card. But our transaction in digital was already growing at around 13% through the first three quarters, ended up growing just under 16%. So I mean the total impact was probably a couple of pennies maybe during the quarter that helped to offset the decreased growth in card. Josh Siegler : Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question goes from the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Your line is now open. Dave Koning : Yeah. Hey guys. Thank you. I guess, my first question when you think about the debit processing platform, it sounds like Q1 still higher expenses year-over-year. There still will be those costs. But maybe how do we think of the full year this year, maybe what's baked in? It seems like you might get kind of a weighted average half year benefit this year. And then maybe the last half year benefit next year. What are the dollar savings from that? Kevin Williams : So as we've historically said Dave, I mean the savings that we're going to see are essentially the same. It's staggered a little bit differently. But as Dave mentioned in his opening comments, we are on course to have all the core customers off the platform by the end of the Q1. All noncore customers are on schedule to be off the other platform by Q3. So we've indicated in the past that there's a minimum of $16 million in cost savings that will come in -- some of that will come in Q2. The rest of it will come in, in Q4. So with the impact of COVID and some of the things we've talked about in Q1 and Q2, so you're going to see some benefit in Q2 but because of the impact of COVID it's not going to be quite what we had talked about in the past, which obviously COVID is hard to foresee. But we will see the margin improvement in Q4 that we've always indicated we'll see. Dave Koning : Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, when I think about incremental margins this year, it seems like you're guiding ex term fees for revenue to grow what $80 million, $90 million, $100 million something in that range of core revenue growth. And then EBIT growth, if you take out term fees again, the decline in term fees is probably up $10 million, $15 million something like that and that includes the cost benefits of the platform conversion. So it just doesn't seem like there's that much profit growth coming from the revenue. Is that conservatism? Or are there some other costs that are happening right now that are just different than normal? Kevin Williams : Well, there's two things. One, we anticipate another probably $6 million or so headwind in decreased license fees and hardware this year that's going to happen, which we've been seeing for the last few years. So, obviously, when you take license revenue down, which is 100% margin that's going to have an impact on your overall margins until you can offset that with recurring revenue, which is really good margins but it's obviously not close to 100% like license revenue. So we're just -- I think at this point with COVID and everything else Dave, we're just trying to be a little conservative on our guidance going into the year. I mean, hopefully things turn out better than that. But we thought it was important for us to provide guidance and where we think we're going to be in this new unchanged world that we're in. Dave Koning : Yeah, that makes sense. And I guess the corollary to that, it seems like the long-term, the next five years, 10 years whatever, the margin progression could be for you and really the industry better than normal because the shift to digital outsourcing those types of things that are higher margin than average. Is that a fair way to think about it? Kevin Williams : It's definitely a fair way to think about it. And as Dave pointed out, in his opening comments, we've been signing a number of new card customers, which none of those are on the platform yet. I mean those are all sitting in backlog to be converted over. And those are all competitive takeaways. So that's going to be new revenue. And we've been a little hesitant on really going aggressively for new sales, until we get this migration done. So, once we get to migration done, I think our sales team is going to be even more aggressive to good stuff. And at that point, we'll be able to start some of them through ProfitStars. Dave Koning : Got you. Okay, great, chat guys thank you. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Dave. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens, Inc. Your line is now open. Brett Huff : Good morning, David and Kevin. Hope you guys are both well. David Foss : Good morning. Kevin Williams : Good morning, Brett. Brett Huff : Two questions, number one, Kevin thanks for the breakdown of the revenue kind of tenor through the next year. That's very helpful. Coming out I think, the guidance was 6% to 8% pro forma growth. As we think about even beyond that if we look to fiscal 2022, which I know is a long way from a crystal ball point of view, you guys have kind of grown I mean probably 7%-ish pretty consistently over the long haul. Is that a good jumping off point for thinking about fiscal 2022 and beyond? Or are there other ups or downs that we should think about starting, around that say midpoint of 7%? Kevin Williams : So Brett obviously the unknown is what COVID is going to be. And what the lingering effect of that is going to be. But barring that, then I think 7% is a very good place to look at for FY 2022. And once we get to the migration, depending on the output of some of the RFPs that Dave mentioned which those would be impacting FY 2022, not FY 2021. And all the card activity we've got going on. I think 7% would be a conservative number for FY 2022. Brett Huff : Okay. That's really helpful. And then bigger picture question, you all have a great balance sheet kind of a hallmark of your company. I know at one point kind of many years ago you had sort of a spate of sort of smaller deals that you did took advantage of some price dislocations in the market. Are you seeing assets out there that are interesting to you maybe bolt-ons, maybe technology that gets you faster to where you want to be, consolidating anything like that? Any sort of thoughts on pricing of deals, and/or interest increasing because of some of the things going on? Thank you. David Foss : Thank you, Brett. It's a good question. We actually -- many weeks ago Kevin and I sat down and said okay -- as we kind of saw this all starting to unfold in the industry, we sat down and said \"Okay. We've got to be ready here because something's going to pop. We're going to find a deal that is going to be a really good deal for Jack Henry. So let's be ready. We would make sure we we're prepared as far as cash on the balance sheet and lines of credit and let's go get aggressive and try and find something.\" And so now we're five and eight weeks, since we had that conversation and there are almost nothing. It's frustrating for us because you know us well. We've done a lot of acquisitions in our history. I feel strongly, we're a solid acquirer. We know how to choose companies. We know how to integrate them in successfully. We don't go looking for crazy, expense synergies on the front end of the deal. We're a disciplined acquirer, as I've said many times. And so we were very ready to find some deals and integrate them. We've had a few come along. Pricing has been a little out of line, on the ones that we have been interested in. But we're continuing to look. So I'm still hopeful that we'll find something that fits our profile and that will be a good addition for Jack Henry. But so far, it's been a little bit more frustrating, than I expected. Brett Huff : Great, thanks for the color. David Foss : Okay. Operator : Thank you. At this time I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Kevin Williams, for closing remarks. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Gigi. Considering the challenge that we've had in the second half of fiscal 2020, we are very pleased with the overall results from our ongoing operations. And I especially want to thank all of our associates for the way they have handled these challenges, by taking care of themselves and our customers. And continue to improve our company on many fronts, for the upcoming fiscal year and the future beyond that. Our executives, managers and all of our associates continue to focus on what is best for our customers and you our shareholders. With that I want to thank you again for joining us today. And Gigi, will you please provide the replay number? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, a replay is available for this call, please dial, 1-800-585-8367 or 404-537-3406 for the replay. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC Dominick Gabriele - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. John Davis - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Jack Henry & Associates First Quarter FY 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Williams. Sir, you may begin. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry & Associates first quarter of fiscal 2021 earnings call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer; and on the call with me this morning is David Foss, President and CEO. In a minute, I'll turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the state of our business, the performance for the quarter and some comments relating to the impacts of COVID-19 and other key initiatives that we have in place. Then after that, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market close and also provide some comments regarding our guidance for our fiscal year 2021 provided in the release, and then we will open the lines for Q&A. First, I need to remind you that this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate, due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for these historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found in yesterday's press release. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our first fiscal quarter particularly in light of the challenges posed by conducting business in the midst of a global pandemic. Now that we are all many months into life with the pandemic, we remain extremely thankful for the fact that very few of our almost 7,000 employees or their family members have been directly affected by the COVID-19 virus. Our HR team is working closely with all the groups around our company to be sure anyone who is affected is receiving the care and accommodations they require. We continue to operate with well over 90% of our employees working full time remote and with a current returned to office date of January 4. Because of the success we've had with our remote work initiatives and because of the ongoing concerns about the pandemic, I fully expect we will extend our return to office date further into 2021, but that decision hasn't yet been made. Most of our customers now have at least a few members of their staff working in their offices full time. As we moved into the fall, several of them have requested that we come on site to work with them on sales engagements and system implementations, and we are normally able to accommodate those requests with no trouble. With that said, our sales teams are now routinely doing sales presentations and executing contracts with no onsite presence at the customer location. We have also completed many 100% remote implementations with great success including several full core conversions. And our customer service teams continue to deliver outstanding service through remote channels while keeping our customer satisfaction ratings very high. Our teams continue to execute in this new environment with the success of the customer always foremost in their mind. With that, let's shift our focus to a look at our performance for the quarter we completed in September. For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, total revenue increased 3% for the quarter and increased 5% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were down more than $9 million over the prior year quarter, which impacts the current quarter negatively but is very good news if you take a long-term view. Turning to the segments, we had another solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 2% for the quarter and increased by 5% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payment segment again performed well, posting a 5% increase in revenue this quarter and a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had another strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses with a 6% increase in revenue this quarter and a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis. Traditionally, our first quarter has been our lightest sales bookings quarter because our fourth quarter tends to be extremely strong and the sales pipeline is depleted as a result. This year was no exception to that trend. With that said, however, the sales teams had several notable successes in Q1. In the quarter, we again booked seven competitive core takeaways with two of them in the multi-billion dollar asset space. We also booked three deals to move existing in-house customers to our private cloud environment. We continued to see good success with our new card processing solution, signing six new debit processing clients this quarter and three new credit clients. All of the deals I just mentioned represent new customers and new revenue to our company. We also continue to see great success signing clients to our Banno Digital suite with 29 new contracts in Q1. Speaking of our digital suite, we have now settled into a comfortable pace of implementing more than 30 new financial institution clients every month on the Banno Platform. We recently surpassed 3 million active monthly users but that number continues to grow rapidly. At the same time, our Banno Platform has been recognized by FI Navigator as having the highest consumer rating in the App Store with 4.79 out of 5 stars. Our Banno Digital suite is well on its way to becoming an industry-leading digital banking solution. The extraordinary success we've seen with sales and adoption of our digital suite is consistent with the expectations coming out of the Bank Director Technology Survey published in August. As they do every year, Bank Director surveyed hundreds of their subscribers during June and July regarding a variety of technology prioritization and spending topics. Almost 60% of the responses they received were from bank CEOs and/or board members, with a large majority of the respondent banks greater than $500 million in assets. The survey showed that as a result of the pandemic, most banks had moved two items to the top of their priority list, the first being an improved customer experience and the other being an improved set of digital offerings. The survey also indicated that 64% of the respondents had increased their technology spending expectations between 5% and 15% as compared to their pre-pandemic budgets. All of this bodes well for the future of our digital suite as well as the other solutions offered by Jack Henry which help facilitate an improved customer experience and an opportunity to enhance efficiency in the financial institution. Regarding our new card processing platform, as of the end of September, we have successfully completed the migration of our approximately 800 core clients in accordance with the plan we have highlighted on these calls for the past three years. We still have the small group of approximately 80 non-core clients left to migrate, but we fully expect to hit our fiscal Q3 target with that group as previously announced. I am very proud of our team and thankful to our partners and clients for working with us to achieve such a successful outcome. Although it didn't impact our Q1 numbers in any way, you undoubtedly saw the announcement of our recent divestiture of our CruiseNet business. The Cruise core solution was used by approximately 140 very small credit unions to perform core processing functions. Jack Henry acquired the business about 20 years ago, but we haven't actively marketed the solution for many years. We had committed to the client base that we would keep the solution compliant but not that we would add features or actively sell the solution. The acquirer is active in the very small financial institution market, so the sale was a good fit for them and the Cruise clients seem very happy with the outcome. The acquirer has rebranded Cruise as Aurora Advantage, and we have partnered with them to allow us to continue to sell and support several of our ProfitStars solutions into their customer base going forward. More information on this transaction will be provided with our Q2 disclosures, but the overall impact is relatively immaterial. As many of you know, we normally conduct our two largest client conferences in the fall each year. Although we chose not to hold in-person conferences this year, we conducted a virtual Symitar conference at the end of August and our banking and ProfitStars conference in October, as previously scheduled. As you might expect, attendance was much larger than our in-person conferences because nobody had to incur any travel expense, and we were able to interact virtually with many of our existing clients and prospects. In a couple of weeks, we will be hosting our annual shareholder meeting and, as we disclosed in our proxy, we have decided to conduct it as a virtual meeting as well. Despite the uncertainty caused by the ongoing pandemic, the key fundamentals of our business remain consistent with the profile I outlined on this call six months ago. We carry almost no debt and operate with a solid cash position, our revenue is more than 85% recurring in nature, and our workforce is highly engaged as evidenced by our engagement survey scores and regular announcements of best places to work awards. As we move forward, we will continue with our disciplined approach to running the company and we expect that approach to continue to provide stability and solid performance for our employees, customers and shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Dave. Our service and support revenue increased 1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago. Adjusting service and support revenues for the deconversion fee revenue for each period, which was $5.8 million in the current fiscal year compared to $14.9 million in the prior fiscal year, or a little over $9 million decrease, this revenue line would have grown 4% for the quarter compared to the previous year. Our service support revenue growth was primarily driven by our data processing and hosting fees in our private cloud, and also software usage fees, which reflects our customers' preference for our term license model, partially offset by a decrease to product delivery and services revenue due to decreased license, hardware and implementation, pass-through and other revenue, but particularly the deconversion fee revenue quarter-over-quarter. Our processing line of revenue increased 7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by higher card volumes from new customers installed last year and increased debit card usage from existing customers. And the Jack Henry Digital revenue experienced the highest percentage growth of all revenue lines due also to new customers installed last year and the increased volumes from existing customers Q1 of this year compared to the same quarter last year. Our total revenue was up 3% for the quarter compared to last year on a GAAP basis, and up a little over 5% on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the deconversion fees. Our cost of revenue was up 7% compared to last year's first quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our card processing platform and higher personnel costs related to increased head count at September 30, 2020 compared to a year ago due to primarily organic growth within our product lines. The increase in costs was partially offset by travel expense savings as a result of COVID-19 travel limitations. Research and development expense increased 6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 over the prior fiscal year first quarter, which this increase was also primarily due to higher personnel costs related to increased head count compared to a year ago. Our SG&A expense decreased 9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 over the same quarter in the prior fiscal year and this decrease was mainly due to travel expense savings as a result of COVID-19 travel limitations, but there was also a decrease in revenue tied to the savings expense due to our user group being in a virtual nature this year. Our reported consolidated operating margins decreased from 27% last year to 26%, which is primarily due to the various revenue headwinds already discussed and the increased costs. On a non-GAAP basis, however, our operating margins increased from 24.7% last year to 25.2% this year, primarily due to the items already mentioned. Our payments segment continues to be impacted by the additional costs related to our card processing platform migration, as Dave discussed in his comments, and our core segment operating margin decreased slightly during the quarter compared to last year, just primarily due to revenue mix, while complementary segment margins actually improved compared to last year quarter, heavily driven by our digital sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter decreased to 22.4% this year compared to 24.6% last year. The decrease in effective tax rate compared with prior fiscal year quarter was primarily due to the difference in the impact of share-based compensation under the long-term incentive plan that vested during each of the periods, which created a larger permanent tax deduction this year compared to the prior year quarter. Net income, $91.2 million for the first quarter compared to $89.4 million last year with earnings per share of $1.19 compared to $1.16. For cash flow, total amortization increased 3% year-to-date compared to last year due to capitalized projects being placed into service. Included in the total amortization is the amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to $4.4 million year-to-date this fiscal year compared to $5.5 million last year. Depreciation expenses up 5% for the year primarily due to CapEx in the previous year and those assets being placed into service. We also purchased 400,000 shares for the treasury in the quarter for $65.9 million. Our operating cash flow was $114.5 million for the first quarter which was down from $123.1 million or 7% compared to last fiscal year. We invested $37.3 million back into our company through CapEx and cap software for developing our products which as a total amount capitalized is down 15% from $44 million compared to year-ago quarter. Our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software and then adding back net proceeds from pending sale of assets, was $83.3 million for the quarter. Couple highlights on our balance sheet. Cash position of $195.3 million, down slightly from $213.3 million at June 30. There is nothing drawn on our revolver, which, again, has a maximum capacity of $700 million. And we had no other long-term debt on our balance sheet other than leases, which is primarily due to the new lease accounting rules adopted in the previous year. Some updates on guidance. As you noticed, we updated both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance in the press release yesterday. Just to be clear, this guidance continues to be based on the assumption that the country continues to open up and the economy continues to improve. Obviously, if the country is forced to shut down again due to the pandemic and the economy stalls or actually reverses, then this guidance will be revised. We'll also note that our GAAP guidance that we continue to forecast revenue from deconversions to be down $33 million from what we saw in FY 2020, which we saw $53.9 million in total deconversion fees in that year. We saw a $9 million decrease in Q1. We expect to see another decrease in deconversion fees in Q2 but probably about half the decrease we saw in Q1. The largest anticipated decrease in deconversion fees will be in Q3 compared to last year, as if you recall, Q3 last year was the largest deconversion fee quarter due to a couple of large deals. We see little to no current M&A activity that would drive deconversion revenue higher at this point, which in the short term will hurt revenue growth. But in the long term, as Dave mentioned, is good for us as we'd much rather keep our customers and the revenue for the long term. This means on a GAAP revenue guidance provided in the press release, impact by the decreased deconversion fees, we're looking at GAAP revenue growth of 3% to 4-plus percent. The only adjustment between GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance is the decrease in deconversion fees. If we see changes during the year in anticipated deconversion revenue, we obviously will update you on future quarterly earnings calls. We expect to continue to have some headwinds on revenue in the first half of the year for several reasons. Some ongoing delayed implementations at customer requests, the continued shift of our customers to our private cloud will continue to put additional headwinds on our licensed hardware and on-prem implementation, and our annual education conferences were virtual events this year which also impacts revenue in the first half of the year. Therefore, for your models, for non-GAAP revenue, I would suggest using a 4.5% to 5% revenue growth in the first half of the year and a 7% to 8% revenue growth in the second half to get you to our guidance of 6% to 6.5% revenue growth for the entire fiscal year, again on a non-GAAP revenue basis. We anticipate GAAP operating margins for all of FY 2021 to be down slightly to the 20% to 21% range for all the reasons previously mentioned, and non-GAAP margins to essentially be in line to slightly up from last year for the entire fiscal year. Our effective tax rate for FY 2021 should still be in line with FY 2020 and for the entire fiscal year be between 22% and 23%. This concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions. Operator, will you please open the call lines up for questions? Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Sir, your line is open. Please ask your question. David John Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hey, guys. Nice job. And I guess my first question, when I looked at this, the support and service line this year that the last couple of years there was kind of this seasonal pattern where you grew, I think, 11% in Q1, then higher single digits Q2, Q3, and then kind of low to mid-single digits in Q4. This year you're starting Q1 at plus 4%. So, it seems like this year is going to shape up differently. Maybe you can talk about the progression through the year and why this Q1 wasn't like closer to that double-digit type range. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, Dave. So, there are a couple of things. One, even though we had a nice increase in software subscriptions this quarter compared to year-ago quarter, it wasn't near as large a percent and part of that was due to some delayed implementations in the second half of last fiscal year which, as you remember, under ASC 606, you recognize 100% of the revenue. So, any of implementations in software subscription that would've been installed in the second half, that would have basically been a few months last year but we would've gotten a full 12 months on the renewal this year. So, that was part of it. The other part, Dave, is the continued headwind of license and hardware and implementation revenue, which is due both to the ongoing move of our in-house customer to outsourcing, but also due to some delays due to COVID because our installers couldn't go out and do some of these due to the banks and credit unions not wanting them on site. So, again, and I'll highlight this, so there were some headwinds on revenue and everybody \u2013 I saw some notes out there. Everybody kind of highlighted our decreased travel expenses, I mean, those two kind of offset. I mean, so there was headwinds on revenue, and there was a decrease in travel expenses, but those two somewhat offset for the impact. So, that's kind of how we get to the 4% growth this quarter. I think for the rest of year it's going to kind of line out. And obviously, as I guided, I think first half is going to be a little lighter on growth. In the second half, I think we're going to see a really nice step up in top line revenue growth, which will be also in both lines of revenue. David John Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got you. Okay. No, that's helpful. I guess the follow-up to that is the back \u2013 obviously the full year is going to be good but the back half being better. Q2 though, it sounds like just a touch of deceleration. If you're saying 4.5% to 5% growth in the first half and Q1 was like almost 5.5%, Q2 might be the lightest quarter. Why is that happening? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well, part of that is because \u2013 and you can look at the last two years since we adopted ASC 606, David, there was a slowdown in Q2 from Q1 because you have all the software subscription revenue in Q1. So, that's just part of ASC 606, and there's no way to avoid that. So, there's going to be a little slowdown in Q2 compared to Q1 as far as growth. But then in Q3 if you look at a GAAP basis is going to be even a little slower because of the huge decrease in deconversion fees that we are predicting in Q3. And then you're going to see some really nice growth in Q4. David John Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got you. That's helpful. And one just really quick one. This is kind of immaterial. Nobody's ever asked the question on a call about your corporate line before, I don't think but it was down a lot. I mean, it's only 3% of revs. Is there something in that line that just this quarter was kind of one-off? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: No, there's nothing really there to highlight, Dave. David John Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: It's just small. Okay. Thank you, guys. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, Dave. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens Corp. Sir, your line is open. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning, Dave and Kevin. How are you guys? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Good. Thanks, Brett. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Doing well. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good. Dave, you may have highlighted this and (23:51) could you talk a little bit about the digital sales that you guys are seeing, how Banno is progressing, and then both the cash management and the treasury management businesses, how those things are selling versus core and things like that? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Okay. So, you were cutting in and out just a little bit, Brett, but I think I got the question. And you're right; I did highlight it in the opening comments. So, Banno, the digital performance has been very strong. I highlighted in my comments that we signed 29 new customers in Q1. And I also highlighted that we're on a pace, now, to install about 30 customers a month that we're bringing live; so, 30 financial institutions live per month. I also highlighted that we recently surpassed 3 million active monthly users. So, that isn't 3 million subscribers. The subscriber number is a lot higher \u2013 I'm sorry? Oh, subscriber number is a lot higher. So, that's 3 million active monthly users, which means they're using \u2013 they're actively in the system every month. So, we've exceeded that number, now. I also highlighted that FI Navigator, who reports on how consumers feel about the various applications, they've now got us as the highest rated digital banking application, with a 4.79 out of 5 stars in the App Store. So, tremendous success with the digital suite at Jack Henry, and we only see that continuing and getting better. As far as the other components you asked about, the treasury management, continuing to sign new customers on treasury management in the quarter. I think we signed four or five. We have about 50 financial institutions live, now, on treasury management. And continuing to enhance that product and continuing to roll that out; so, good success all around when it comes to digital. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. And then, Kevin, I just want to make sure that I get the revenue acceleration at the back half. I know some of it is ASC 606. Some of it, it sounds like it's just timing of delayed implementations that maybe happened the last year that maybe now will flow not into one half, but more into second half. Are those the two primary drivers or am I \u2013 I want to make sure I'm not missing anything on that rev acceleration. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: So, Brett there's a couple of things and you hit most of them. But the other thing is the continued growth in our card business because we are now \u2013 with all of our core customers now migrated over, we're having pretty good success in the sales. As Dave mentioned, we signed several new ones \u2013 customers in Q1. So, we can now focus more on bringing new customers on. So, you're going to continue to see nice growth there. Digital is just going to continue to grow very nicely. So, our processing line of revenue is going to continue to grow at this pace and actually accelerate in Q4, based on what we're seeing. And then, the support and service line, we're going to lap some things. So, Q4 should be a little easier comp there. So, those are the primary drivers for the accelerated growth. Primarily in Q4 is where we anticipate seeing that growth rate. Now, again, as I said in my opening comments, that's all subject to the economy continuing to percolate and get along and not having another shutdown. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just in terms of how the decision-making is happening at banks just generally, I assume it's still digital-focused. How are the core conversations going? Are those being put on the back burner at all as people focus on digital? Any kind of change in that dialogue at all? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. It's interesting. So, another thing I highlighted was the fact that in the Bank Director survey here with 64% of the respondents in the survey \u2013 with most of them being over $500 million in assets, 64% of the respondents had set their technology spending budgets \u2013 or increased their technology spending budgets by 5% to 15% as compared to their pre-pandemic, and that's what we're seeing now. The flow of RFPs has picked up, recently, particularly on the core side. So, we have a bunch of RFPs we're working right now on the core side. Continuing to sign new customers, but the rate of interest is increasing. And I think what's happening \u2013 so not only having good, solid success on digital and, certainly, with our payments platform with customers we're signing there, but just overall I think people are kind of settling in now to be \u2013 to doing business in the COVID world and they're finding those deficiencies and what they have with the technology they're currently operating, and so RFPs are starting to really ramp up. So, we'll see. The decision pace, I would say, is moving along well. Getting contracts finished is a little more challenging than it used to be because the attorneys are working remote from their house in one city and the CEO is working remote from their house in a different place, and some of that coordination is a little more challenging than it used to be. But deals are getting signed and there is a lot of interest in Jack Henry technology as evidenced by the RFP flow. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Great. That's what I needed. I appreciate the help, guys. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Brett. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mr. David Togut from Evercore. Sir, your line is open. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Good morning. Dave, you called out a somewhat slower pace of closing core deals. Could you bracket for us what the sale cycles are like today in the COVID environment versus pre-COVID in terms of number of months, for example, for a core signing? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. It's a good point. It's taking longer to get a core deal done. So, we did seven this quarter. We did seven the prior quarter. And so, it's definitely taking a little longer to get deals done. Once the deal is done, the actual conversion process isn't taking any longer because we're doing so much remote now. But I'd say we've probably added another month or so to the actual signing process. But as I just mentioned in the conversation with Brett, the RFP pipeline is very solid. It's amazing the number of RFPs that are coming in on the core side. So that's \u2013 I'm not just talking about other products, I'm talking about interest in Jack Henry core solutions. So, they're a little slower right now than they have been in the past but we're still seeing deals and we're still getting deals done. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Understood. And just as a follow-up, Kevin, you called out $195 million in cash on the balance sheet. You've clearly got a lot of potential to allocate capital now, whether it be acquisitions, dividends, buybacks. How do you rank your capital allocation priorities given your current balance sheet? And when you look at, let's say, the valuation of acquisition opportunities in the pipeline versus your own stock, how do you weigh that decision? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. So, David, I mean, obviously, you've known us quite a while and you know that our first use would be to find the right acquisition, to bring additional products just to cross-sell to our customers and get a higher return to our shareholders. But you're absolutely right, the valuations continue to be a little high out there for what we're seeing. There's not a lot of really good assets that we're seeing out there right now. But we do continue to look and we will continue to look for the right acquisition. Having said that, with nothing out there, obviously we have a shareholders' meeting here in a couple weeks and our quarterly board meetings and we'll be discussing at that the use of cash. I'm sure we'll continue the dividend program and we typically increase the dividend in the February time period. So I don't see why we would change that. But again, that's up to the board. And I'm sure that we will continue to buy back some stock going forward as we don't see any more acquisitions on the horizon getting any closer. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Just a quick final question if I could. Dave, would appreciate your perspective on open APIs in the banking industry and how you're, let's say, making the core available through open APIs to the extent a best-in-breed provider wants to connect into a customer for a point solution. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yes. I'm glad you asked that, David. We are big believers in that concept and have been since the founding of this company. Before the term API was a term, the concept of Jack Henry has always been to be open. We've always been committed to the idea of making our platforms available to others through easy connectivity. We don't set up artificial walls to keep people out. And a lot of people over the years have viewed that as being very counterintuitive. But I think the philosophy of Jack Henry has always been that we're here to make our customers successful. They're not here to make us successful. And so, if we're going to help make them successful, we should provide the tools that enable them to connect to whoever they want to connect to. I think the best example of this in something you can see is for people who go to our client conferences, and this has been true forever at Jack Henry, you go to a Jack Henry client conference, you go into the exhibit hall and you will see hundreds of exhibitors in there. And almost every one of them competes with Jack Henry. We don't allow core vendors in there, but other than that, pretty much anybody else is allowed in. And so, you've got digital vendors and you've got payments vendors and everybody under the sun in our space has a booth in the exhibit hall and they will all tell our customers that they love working with Jack Henry because we are the ones that have always been truly committed to the idea of open connectivity. So today, APIs are the preferred tool. But prior to that, we had point-to-point integration that we supported readily and made available to our customers. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Understood. Thanks very much. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Hey, good morning. Dave, I know you've been kind of asked this question in the past, but I'm wondering, I know in the short run there's a lot of talk about using digital technology. I'm wondering as you have conversations with your customers what they think might be a permanent shift in behavior or changes and how that maybe benefits Jack Henry or how Jack Henry might have to change to adapt to any changes that are going to occur as a result of the current pandemic. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Well, it's a good question. The key thing, and I think it's evidenced in that survey that I cited from Bank Director, we have all these CEOs and board members of banks \u2013 and credit unions were not included in the survey, so I'll just talk banks for a moment. All these CEOs and directors who through that survey have indicated that they really are shifting their focus to digital because they know that their consumers aren't necessarily going to come into the branch for all the banking services going forward like they did in the past. And so, enabling a digital lending experience, which we have done, and I've talked about many times on this call our commercial lending center suite in the past, and enabling full consumer functionality and business functionality through the digital channel is a key part of their strategy and a key part of our strategy. Now, one of the things we talk about a lot and I've talked about it on this call a few times is, okay, if your consumer is going to start interacting with you, the bank digitally, how do you ensure \u2013 as a community bank or credit union, how do you ensure that your experience is differentiated from the majors. And so that's where we've really put a lot of focus and that's why I think we're having so much success with the Banno Platform is because we've created a differentiated experience for the consumer. The digital experience with Banno is not the same as with all the other vendors out there, because we've tried to create an experience that comes close to the same experience the consumer would have if they were in the branch, meaning direct personal service which is what community banks and credit unions have always used to differentiate themselves from their major competitors. We've created that similar experience through the digital channel. And so, it truly has differentiated us and our platform. And I think as customers really start to understand that, whether they're Jack Henry core customers or not, as they really start to understand that and that need to differentiate themselves in the digital environment, they will really look seriously at our platform. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : And then, Kevin, I know you've talked about this. Just I'm wondering on long-term margins, obviously this year you're being impacted by COVID-19, you're being impacted by the fact that you're transitioning your credit and debit platform. But as you finish that and we go into next fiscal year, I'm wondering what you think long-term margin prospects or medium-term margin prospects look like. Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Well, I mean, like I said, Kartik, we're going to see a lift in Q4 as we've been stating for the last two and a half, three years as we go through this payment migration. So, we'll get a lift in Q4. And then from that and just the increased sales and implementations of our card platforms, both debit and credit and digital, we should continue to see margin improvement, the continued shift of customers from our in-house to outsourcing which also drives margin improvement. So, I mean, I haven't sat down and just tried to put a fence around it to figure out exactly what that margin is going to look like in FY 2022, Kartik, but it's going to be up nicely from FY 2021, again, depending on the pandemic and COVID and all that. But if everything remaining equal, we'll see a nice margin uplift in 2022 compared to full year 2021. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Yeah. And then just one last question, Dave. Obviously, there's some conversation about Google partnering with banks to have its own branded checking account. And there's stories about maybe Amazon doing something similar. Any concerns from your customers as to how that might impact them or is there anything you can do to help them that could benefit Jack Henry? David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Anything we could do to help our customers or help Google? Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Help your customers, or even Google if you want to. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: I just wanted to make sure you were \u2013 in terms of where you were trying to take this conversation. So, yes, we have spoken with some of our customers. Interestingly, in Google's solution, they're partnering with a couple of credit unions and they're trying this in several different ways. So, we've talked with some of our customers. No immediate threat that they perceive with what's happening there, as also I think they've seen with all the other neo-bank experiences that are available in the United States today. But we're keeping a close eye on that. We're trying to make sure that we're ahead of the game to help our customers if there are opportunities. It is \u2013 again, I'll go back to our complete online digital lending platform that we rolled out a couple, three years ago. We did that because we saw what was happening with OnDeck and Kabbage and the potential for those solutions to disintermediate the commercial borrower from our customers. So, we were very successful with that and helping those customers who needed to fend off those competitors. And we'll do similar things here as we see those opportunities. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dominick Gabriele from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Dominick Gabriele - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. Have you talked to your bank or credit union partners about perhaps excess capital that they may have on their balance sheets if net charge-offs don't materialize in the same magnitude for which they've reserved and what they may do with this potentially large amount of excess capital? Have they talked about increased tech investments with a portion of that with you? Thanks. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: So, I wouldn't say they've specifically said we expect to have excess capital and we're going to use that for technology. I think the discussion about increasing technology spending is more about their requirement, their need to remain relevant as customers are moving away from doing business in branch and moving more toward an online experience. So, I think it's pretty premature for most of our customers to be thinking about the idea that they may have excess capital. Most of them are ensuring that they're in a good capital position to fend off any losses that may happen as the pandemic continues to unfold. So, I view those conversations as kind of two separate conversations. There's the making sure you're well capitalized in case there are issues on the loan side, and then this need for increased spending separate and apart from that to ensure that you remain relevant to your consumer and that they want to continue to do business with you in a digital environment. Dominick Gabriele - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. That makes a lot of sense. And if you just think about the implementation of the core products, and then your complementary products as well, and cross-sell after you've won a core partner, could you just go over, again, on what perhaps that time period is between implementation of your core and, then, the kind of tail of these extra API add-ons or cross-selling opportunities? And how long do those typically last, the add-ons after a win? Thanks so much. I really appreciate it. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. It's an interesting question. Normally, when somebody is choosing to do business with us on the core side \u2013 so they're coming to Jack Henry as a new core customer, normally they will wrap the core with a whole bunch of other solutions at the same time. So, it's rare for somebody to say I'm going to come and bring my core business to Jack Henry, but nothing else. Normally, they will, if they're going to do that major technology upgrade on the core, they look at a lot of other solutions they have and say we want to upgrade our technology on all these other things at the same time and go through that integration experience once. So, that would be my first point in answering your question is normally they're buying the core and maybe 20 or 30 other Jack Henry solutions at the same time. And then, once they are in place and start to experience working with our group, it may be a month after they go live, they've realized, oh, we really should have included this, and they add something else; or, it may be a year after they go live. But the good news is we have a very long history of continuing to cross-sell products. We have such a broad suite of products that, over the life of the relationship, we just continue to sell more and more and more to those customers. If we're doing our jobs correctly, we continue to sell more and more to those customers. So, I think that's the best way to think about those situations. Dominick Gabriele - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Mr. John Davis from Raymond James. Your line is open. John Davis - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. So I really just wanted to start on Q1 results, specifically on the top line. I think last quarter, you guys guided for the full year; said first half adjusted net revenue would be 3% to 5%. It did actually just slightly north of 5%. So what went better in the quarter? Was it installations \u2013 or implementations rather? Just what kind of exceeded your expectations relative to your guide? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. JD, it was primarily card and digital were the two that exceeded our expectations. So, it was primarily all in the processing line. And to be quite honest, the headwinds in the support service line were a little stronger than we thought they were going to be. So \u2013 but all the uplift was in the processing line of revenue. John Davis - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then, other revenue was down 23% in the quarter. Just curious, is that kind of the new run rate? How should we think about that going forward, because that was a little bit surprising? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: So, JD, that's primarily in the corporate segment. And this is \u2013 to answer actually yours and David Koning's question from earlier, the big part of that is related to our education conference/user group was the biggest chunk of that. And then the other part of it is just pass-through costs from our travelers not being out for go out for billable travel to pass through. So, those are the two primary drivers of other being down. As our travelers pick back up, that will level out. Obviously, as Dave mentioned in his opening comments, our education conferences, Symitar is normally in the first quarter. JAC which is Banking and (45:21) ProfitStars sits in the second quarter. So, there'll be some revenue impact in the other line in Q2 just like there was in Q1, actually it'll be a little larger because JAC is typically larger than the SEC. And then Q3 and Q4 for other revenue should kind of level out with previous year. John Davis - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then, the last one for me just on the M&A front. Just curious, obviously we're still in the middle of pandemic, but if you didn't notice any meaningful changes, whether it's valuation expectations, assets for sale, just anything from a private and market perspective. Are you more encouraged, less encouraged? What do you think the pipeline looks like from an M&A perspective as we go over the next, call it, three to six months? Kevin D. Williams - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: So, JD, just to be clear, you're talking about M&A from us acquiring not within the (46:13) industry, correct? John Davis - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Correct, yes. Correct. Your acquisitions, yes. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, I'd say valuation expectations, have they changed? Yes. It's been interesting with a few of the FinTech and InsurTech IPOs that have happened recently, I think there's a lot of companies out there with stars in their eyes thinking that they're going to get those same valuations. So, we're seeing that, companies that are potential \u2013 that maybe in the past wouldn't have ever really thought about an IPO, now they're thinking IPO. They're thinking, oh my gosh, look at that valuation or the stack concept, of course, is alive and well out there too. So, it's a little challenging as far as valuation expectations right now. We are seeing deals. I think on the last call, somebody asked about what we were seeing and I was frustrated frankly at the time because we had seen so little and we assumed the pandemic would drive some people to put their companies up for sale and we were really seeing very little. Now there's more of a normal deal flow coming through. So, we're looking at deals. But to your point, expectations for valuations have definitely increased. And you know as well we're a disciplined acquirer. We don't chase after the shiny object when it comes to acquisitions. And so, we haven't bid on any of them yet. But we are actively looking at deals. John Davis - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Thanks, guys. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, JD. Operator : There are no follow-up questions at this time, sir. Please continue. David B. Foss - Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.: Thank you, I appreciate it. Again, we were pleased with the overall results from our ongoing operations. I want to thank all of our associates for the way they have handled these challenges, by taking care of themselves and our customers and continue to work hard to improve our company on all fronts for the future. All of us at Jack Henry continue to focus on what is best for our customers and shareholders. With that, thanks again for joining us. And operator, will you please provide the replay number for the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Please note that today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Williams. Kevin, the floor is yours. Kevin Williams : Thank you, Jay. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry & Associates Second Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer. And on the call with me today is David Foss, our President and CEO. In just moment, I'll turn the call over to Dave. He's going to provide his thoughts about the state of our business, the performance of the quarter and some comments relating to the impact of COVID-19, thoughts on our recently published corporate sustainability report and some other key initiatives that we have in place. Then after that, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the earnings release we put out yesterday after market close and then provide comments regarding our guidance for our FY '21 provided in the release, and then we will open the line up for Q&A. First, I need to remind you that this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those, which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. Also on this call, we would discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income, as disclosed in the press release yesterday. The reconciliations for historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found in yesterday's press release. I'll now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong revenue growth and an overall solid performance by our business. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our second fiscal quarter, particularly in light of the challenges posed by conducting business in the midst of a global pandemic. We remain extremely thankful for the fact that very few of our employees or their family members have been directly affected by the COVID-19 virus. Our HR teams continue to work closely with all groups around our company to be sure anyone who is affected is receiving the care and accommodations they require. We're still operating with well over 90% of our employees working full-time remote and have now updated our return to office date to July 1. At this point, I don't anticipate us extending that date, although I definitely expect long-lasting changes to our in-office work model. Most of our customers now have many people physically in their locations every day, and we regularly receive requests to deliver on-site sales engagements and system implementations. As I mentioned on the last call, our sales teams are routinely doing sales presentations and executing contracts with no on-site presence at the customer location. We have also completed many 100% remote implementations with great success, including several full core conversions. With that, let's shift our focus to a look at our performance for the quarter we completed in December. For Q2 of fiscal 2021, total revenue increased 1% for the quarter and increased 2% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were down more than $5.5 million over the prior year quarter, which impacts the current quarter negatively, but as we have highlighted in the past, is good news, if you take a long-term view. Turning to the segments, we again had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 1% for the quarter and increased by 4% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment also performed well, posting a 2% increase in revenue this quarter and a 3% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a strong quarter in our Complementary solutions business with a 3% increase in revenue this quarter and a 4% increase on a non-GAAP basis. As I mentioned in the press release, our sales teams, again, had a very solid quarter as they booked the fifth largest sales quarter in the history of the Company. We inked six competitive core takeaways and 12 deals to move existing in-house customers to our private cloud environment. On previous calls, I highlighted the fact that our competitive core signings have slowed a bit as a result of the pandemic and that was also true in Q2. With that in mind, you may ask how it was possible for us to book the fifth largest quarter in history with less than the new core win category. Of course, this happens because the sales teams have had tremendous success with our broad suite of complementary offerings, including digital, fraud and payment solutions. During the quarter, we signed 61 new clients to our Banno Digital suite, six new clients on our treasury management platform and 11 new clients on our card processing solution. Of course, all of these contracts represent new revenue to Jack Henry. As I mentioned last quarter, we continued to implement more than 30 new financial institution clients every month on our Banno Digital platform. As of February 1, we now have more than 4 million users on the platform, but that number continues to grow rapidly. At the same time, our Banno platform has been recognized by FI Navigator as having the highest consumer rating in the App store, and we are continuing to receive accolades as the fastest application in the industry. If you combine our inroads in the digital banking space, with our ongoing success with digital lending and digital account opening, we see great things ahead for Jack Henry as a leader in this area. Regarding our new card processing platform, as of the end of December, we have successfully completed the migration of all of our core clients and many of our non-core clients. We will complete all of the migrations next month as previously announced. You will start to see the larger positive impact on our financials in the fourth fiscal quarter as we have emphasized throughout the project. I'm very proud of our team and thankful to our partners and clients for working with us to achieve such a successful outcome. Recently, the Federal Reserve announced that its FedNow team has been working closely with a few companies over the past year to help them design and develop the FedNow network. We have been very active with the FedNow team for more than a year, and we're excited to participate in their pilot program. We look forward to bringing many financial institutions live through our payments hub, which we have branded Jack Henry Henry Pay Center. As I've discussed previously, our Pay Center solution was designed to provide Pay Center. As I've discussed previously, our pay center solution was connectivity through a single platform to multiple real-time payments providers, which facilitates a more logical and efficient approach for our clients than any other processor in the market today. Additionally, it allows us to connect clients to the real-time payments network in groups rather than one at a time, which is a significant enhancement over any other offering in the industry. In addition to working with the Fed on the FedNow program, many of you know that we have also been very involved in the rollout of the PPP program through the first two rounds last year and the latest round earlier this year. We are currently working with many of our financial institution clients to help submit and process thousands of PPP loans with their current pipeline totaling almost $1 billion in loans to small businesses around the country. Hopefully, many of you noticed that we released our first corporate sustainability report on December 31. Although I'm very proud of the report and its content, I think it's important to note that Jack Henry has practiced the concepts of corporate responsibility since our founding. This report is our way of summarizing the standards and practices we've been dedicated to for more than 40 years and which are evident every day as we strive in all cases to adhere to our guiding principle of doing the right thing. In the report, we discussed our commitments to our five key stakeholders : our employees, customers, stockholders, communities and the environment. Our investment in corporate responsibility is embodied through our commitment to : enabling our associates to engage in meaningful work that they love; providing innovative financial solutions to our customers to support responsible business decisions and keep their clients connected, delivering a strong return on investment to our stockholders while maintaining long-term sustainability for our business model; encouraging our communities to flourish by connecting people with technology and pursuing environmentally friendly practices to support a strong future for us all. In January, Cornerstone Advisors published the results of their annual survey of bank and credit union executives. According to that study, 73% of banks in our target market expect to increase their technology spending as they rebound from the pandemic in 2021, with 22% of them indicating an increase of greater than 10% year-over-year. This correlates with the information we're receiving from other sources, which puts the average expected increase in tech spending for 2021 in our market at around 5%. I think that pent-up demand is reflected in the continued influx of RFPs we're receiving and the ongoing interest in Jack Henry Technology Solutions. As we begin the second half of our fiscal year, our sales pipeline is very robust, and we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our customers, our ability to expand our customer relationships, the spending environment and our long-term prospects for success. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Dave. Our service support revenue line of revenue decreased 2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago. However, adjusting services for revenue for the deconversion fees of $2.1 million in the current quarter and deconversion fees of $7.7 million revenue and divestitures of $1.2 million in the prior fiscal year quarter, this revenue line would have grown 2% for the quarter compared to the previous year. Service and support revenue primary driver was data processing and hosting fees in our private cloud, which continues to show very strong growth in the quarter compared to the previous year. However, the growth in that line was totally offset by a decrease in our product delivery and services revenue, which is due to decreased license, hardware and imitation revenue for primarily on premise customers; pass-through revenue, which is related to our billable travel, primarily related to travel limitations related to COVID; and our Jack Henry Annual Conference, or our JAC, which was held virtually, and therefore, no registration fees for customers or vendors for our tech fair. And then obviously, as mentioned, deconversion fee revenue for the quarter compared to the prior year, which is -- all those lines were a decrease. Processing revenue increased 5% in the second quarter of fiscal '21 compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. This increase was primarily driven by higher card volumes from new customers installed last quarter and increased debit card usage from existing customers. Jack Henry digital revenue experienced the highest percentage growth of all revenue lines in both Q2 and year-to-date this year compared to the same periods last year. Our total revenue was up 1% for the quarter, as Dave mentioned, compared to last year on a GAAP basis and was up a little over 2% on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of deconversion fees and revenue from divestitures. Our cost of revenue was up 3% compared to last year second quarter. This increase was due primarily due to higher costs associated with our card processing platform and higher personnel costs related to increased headcount at December 31 compared to a year ago quarter. The increase in cost was partially offset by travel expense savings as a result, again, of COVID travel limitations. Our research and development expense decreased 1% for the quarter compared to last year. This decrease was due primarily to a slightly higher percentage of our overall costs being capitalized for product development this quarter compared to a year ago. Our SG&A expense decreased 10% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 over the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. This decrease was primarily almost completely due to travel-related expense savings as a result of COVID-19, which required us to hold our JAC virtual this year as previously mentioned, and also due to the gain on disposal of assets in this quarter of this year. Our reported consolidated operating margins decreased slightly from 22.4% last year to 22.2%, which is primarily due to the various revenue headwinds already discussed and our increased cost. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating margins increased from 21.1% last year to 21.3% this year, primarily due to the items already mentioned. Our payments segment margins continue to be impacted by the digital costs related to our card processing platform migration. As Dave mentioned -- as he discussed in his opening comments, our core segment operating margins increased slightly during the quarter compared to last year on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis, while complimentary segment margins decreased slightly on a GAAP basis, but improved on a non-GAAP basis compared to last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was essentially flat at 23.1% this year compared to 23.2% last year. And our net income was $72 million for the second quarter compared to $72.1 million last year, with earnings per share of $0.94 in both quarters. For cash flow, our total amortization increased 4% year-to-date compared to last year due to capitalized projects being placed into service in the past. Included in the total amortization is amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to $8.9 million year-to-date this fiscal year compared to $10.5 million last year. Our depreciation was up 5% year-to-date, primarily due to CapEx in the previous year and those assets being placed into service. We purchased 675,000 shares of Jack Henry stock year-to-date for $110 million, and we paid dividends of $65.5 million for a total return to shareholders of $175.5 million year-to-date. Our operating cash flow was $194 million for the first six months of the fiscal year, which is down a little from $215 from $215 million last fiscal year. We invested $76.6 million back into our company through CapEx and capitalized software. And our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow, less CapEx and less cap software and then adding back net proceeds from disposal of asset was $163.8 million year-to-date. A couple of comments on our balance sheet as of December 31, our cash position is still in very good shape at $147.8 million, down a little from $213 million at June 30. Due to the previous items discussed, there is nothing drawn on the revolver, which has a maximum capacity of $700 million. So, we've got a lot of dry powder, and we had no other long-term dean balance sheet other than the capitalized operating leases. In the press release yesterday, we confirmed both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance yesterday, and they were basically guided as previously in line. However, just to be clear that return to shareholders this guidance continues to be based on the assumption that the country continues to open up and the economy continues to improve. Obviously, if the country is forced to shut down again due to the pandemic or the economy stalls or actually reverses, then this guidance will be revised. Also, I'd like to emphasize that in our GAAP guidance that we continue to forecast revenue from deconversion fees for FY '21 will be down approximately $33 million from what we saw in FY '20. We have seen $14.6 million decrease in the first half of the year alone, and we will see a significant decrease in Q3 as that was the largest quarter for deconversion revenue last fiscal year and the largest increase year-over-year. We see little to no current M&A activity that would drive deconversion revenue at this point, which, in the short term, as Dave mentioned, will hurt revenue growth. But in the long term, as we have always said that we don't like deconversion revenue as we would much rather keep the customer and the revenue to the long term. This means based on the GAAP revenue guidance provided in the press release impacted by the decreased deconversion fees, we continue to look at a GAAP revenue growth of 3-to 4-plus percent. The adjustments between GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance for FY '21 is the decrease in deconversion fees compared to the previous year and the small revenue impact from the cruise divestiture in Q2, it was removed from FY '20 for comparison to FY '21. Our non-GAAP revenue guidance has not changed from Q1, the difference of all deconversion fees and revenue from the divestiture. We anticipate GAAP operating margins for the full year of FY '21 to be down just slightly at about 22% from last year for all the reasons previously mentioned, and our non-GAAP margins to actually improve slightly compared to last year for the entire fiscal year. Our effective tax rate for FY '21 should be in line with FY '20 at around 22%. And with the significant headwinds created by the projected significant decrease in deconversion revenue in our third fiscal quarter, we are guiding Q3 EPS to be $0.83 to $0.87, which I believe is generally in line with the current consensus. However, we have increased our full year EPS guidance for FY '21, which we provided last quarter to be in the range of $3.75 to $3.80, and we are now updating our EPS guidance for FY '21 to the range of $3.85 to $3.90, with no change to our projected impact decrease in deconversion fees. The increase in guidance is primarily due to expense control, margin improvement for the year and continued improved efficiencies. This concludes our opening comments. We are now ready to take questions. Jay, will you please open the call lines up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Kevin, I apologize. Could you just walk through the revenue guidance part again? I'm just trying to understand maybe what was in the press release this time versus what you guided last time. I thought there was about a $30 million difference, but I just wanted to make sure I understood. Kevin Williams : So Kartik, I mean, so the GAAP guidance that we are providing is $1.760 million to $1.770 million. And basically, you take the $30 million decrease in deconversion fees out, and that's how you get to the $1.730 million to $1.740. Obviously, there's a lot of other moving parts and rounding and different things in there. But by the time you get everything adjusted and the rounding taken into effect, which obviously takes a pretty significant spreadsheet, you're still looking at the 6% to 6.5% non-GAAP revenue growth over last year's adjusted number. Kartik Mehta : So, the $1.730 million to 1.740 million is the non-GAAP revenue that you're guiding to the then? Kevin Williams : Yes. Kartik Mehta : Okay. And then, David, I'm just wondering, as you look at your migration of platform and demand from your bank, I know in the past, you had said that you thought there would be demand for your banks to get into the credit card business. I'm wondering where that stands now and if you're seeing that come to fruition? David Foss : Yes, Kartik, I won't say, we never said that we expected it to be a huge demand, but we certainly are continuing to see demand. We've signed five so far brand-new credit card customers, so far this year. There -- we had kind of -- and I've talked about this on previous calls, we kind of kept the brakes a little bit on credit because we wanted to successfully complete the debit side of the conversion and didn't want our implementation teams to be focusing on trying to add new credit customers because that's a separate, different implementation. So, we've had the brakes on a little bit on the sales side on the credit side, but there is demand there. We expect to see demand going forward. But again, it won't be -- we don't expect to be a major issuer in the future, but we certainly are seeing demand from our customers. Kartik Mehta : And then just one last question, Dave. What are your customers doing about or trying to do about some of the fintech competition they have, whether it would be Chime or any of these other guys? Are you seeing demand for different type of products? Or how concerned are your customers about those fintech competitors? David Foss : Yes. Well, there's a few different aspects to that question. So first, there are some that are trying to figure out whether or not the neo banks are truly competitors or not. Oftentimes, the neo banks are attracting the customer who's looking for free. And our customers like any customer have trouble making money on free. So sometimes they're not terribly distressed if some of those customers leave to go to somebody like Chime. I think that explains why these neo banks aren't making any money. But that's the short-term view, and we take a long-term view, are they going to attract the customer and then build on that customer for the long term. So, a lot of our customers are trying to figure out how to compete in that space, many of them have launched digital-only banks, digital-only brands. And of course, we support that. We've talked about that on the call before. Where we're hosting a separate brand in our Jack Henry private cloud, a separate processing environment, separate marketing by the bank to make sure that they have an opportunity to attract those customers. The other approach that some banks are taking is trying to figure out how to partner more closely with fintechs, so not necessarily with a neo bank, but with other fintechs to enable the same type of we'll say, cool experience, make sure that they're providing that connectivity. And of course, as I've discussed many times on this call, Jack Henry is very supportive of that environment, where we provide the hooks, provide the connectivity for fintechs to connect into our infrastructure and help our banks achieve success that way. So, it depends on the bank. You have some who maybe put their head in the sand a little bit. You have others who are being aggressive about launching digital-only banks. And then, you have some that are working with fintechs to create a whole new experience in some other way. And it just depends on the profile of the bank and their feeling of the competitive nature of those players. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is Carson on for Pete. Just one quick question. I believe you had previously said that the Company expects to recognize around $16 million reduction in annualized direct costs of revenue as the legacy debit processing platforms are shut down, but perhaps 30% to 40% of this showing up in fiscal '21. Is it still about, right? Kevin Williams : I don't know that 30% or 40% it was because that was kind of the guide we gave before we moved everything out a quarter. So, it's probably going to be a little less than that, that we see the impact in Q4 because remember, that number that we gave was for the full year annual cost savings. So, we're probably going to see more like 15% to 20% of it in this year, and then we'll see the full amount in FY '22. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Steve Comery from G. Research. Your line is open. Steven Comery : Wanted to ask about sort of the dichotomy between core demand and complementary demand as far as like what's holding back demand on the core side and what's driving it on the complementary side? David Foss : Sure. So the biggest thing is core, if you think about a core replacement, anybody who makes that decision. Look, the thing I say all the time is, if you're the CEO of a bank or credit union, when you decide to make a core replacement, that's the most difficult technology decision you will ever make in your role as the CEO of a bank or credit union because when you replace the core, it touches everything, right? You're replacing the entire guts of your processing operation. And so in this environment, the pandemic environment, where everybody had people working from home, that type of decision and that type of disruptive move was a little bit challenging for a lot of CEOs to make that move. But they still wanted to offer innovative new technologies. They need to take care of the customers, particularly because all of their consumers were living and working from home and expected to have an outstanding digital experience, so they needed to continue to implement these smaller point solutions, complementary solutions to augment the services that they provide for their consumers and that they provide internally to their employees. And so, that's where we have this broad suite of complementary solutions, and I highlighted a few of them on the call today, that's where a lot of those things have really stepped up, particularly around digital. So, there's digital banking, which we used to call online banking and mobile banking. There's digital lending. There's digital account origination. All those things have been hot commodities here lately because of that move to remote work. Kevin Williams : And one other thing I'd throw out there is, there's roughly 11,000 banks in credit in the United States and a very small percentage of those actually go through a core system evaluation on an annual basis, but a very high percentage of that 11,000 FIs need to upgrade their digital or other things, as Dave mentioned. So, I think that's a big driver or a big difference in the two. Steven Comery : Okay. Yes. So, I mean should I read that as there is some degree of pent-up core demand just from companies not doing evaluations this year, not executing on them? David Foss : Yes. Yes. So, on the -- I think it was the August call -- no, the November call, I highlighted there that the RFP pace for new core deals had really started to pick up. And that -- so you're absolutely right. There is pent-up demand. People just kind of put a stop on it, but they still need to upgrade their infrastructure. So, we saw RFP start to pick up in the late fall. I'll say, I highlighted on the November call, and that's absolutely true today. So, we are today -- if you look at our sales pipeline today, it is as full as it was, we'll say, 18 months ago. So, 18 months ago -- let me back up a second. We normally think in terms, as we run the business, the sales pipeline you want to be. You want to have about 90% of the annual quota for the Company at any given day, the sales pipeline should be at about 90% of the full year's quota because some deals aren't going to happen, and some will happen and so on. And we're back to that level now. So, we're almost about 90% of our annual quota is in the pipeline today. And that's the way I say, the engine is running again where core demand has picked up, and that's part of the reason that I'm pretty optimistic about our opportunity for sales success going forward. Steven Comery : Okay. And then maybe just finally, is the trigger for actually executing on these core contracts or starting implementations? Is the trigger people actually coming back into the office or is there sort of a different trigger where banks sort of lap the credit risk? David Foss : No, yes, it's not necessarily then coming back into the office. I think we're to the point today where there are -- all of our banks and credit unions have figured out their operating model. So, they have people in the office. They have people working remote. I don't know of any of them that have gone back to 100% in office. They figured out their operating model. And so, I don't expect -- I'll say ever, maybe that's too dramatic, but I don't expect ever. To get back to our operating model for banks and credit unions to be like it was two years ago. They'll have a remote workforce going forward, just like we will. So that is not the trigger. I think now it's them understanding how to run the business with a combination of in office and remote, and they recognize they need to do a technology upgrade. Okay, now let's get down to business and make that decision and move forward with the technology upgrade. And then we can do conversion -- core conversions, 100% remote. Now I highlighted it in my opening comments here, we're doing 100% remote conversions. Most banks and credit unions don't particularly like that. They prefer to have at least a few people on site, but we're fully capable of doing that. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of John Davis of Raymond James. Your line is open. John Davis : Kevin, I appreciate the comments on the 3Q EPS guide. Obviously, your full year guide implies roughly 8% non-GAAP growth, revenue growth in the back half of the year? Any help there? How we should think about that sequentially 3Q versus 4Q? Kevin Williams : Well, I mean, there's obviously a lot of conversions that are going to be happening. Some of those were pushed out from the first half, JD. Obviously, the payment engine is really picking up pace. The digital continues to grow very nicely. Plus, especially on the payment side, Q4 is going to be a little easy comp compared to last year because of the impact of COVID last year. So, I mean it's a combination of things. There's not just one thing I would point to JD. But I mean, our -- I mean, we have monthly calls with all of our VPs and senior VPs, Dave and I do. And I can assure you that, in fact, we had one just earlier this week or last week. And they all still feel very, very good about the forecast and the guidance that we're giving out there for the balance of this fiscal year. John Davis : Okay. But I would assume that all else equal, you're going to have stronger growth in 4Q just given the easier comps. So, it kind of builds sequentially. Kevin Williams : Absolutely, I mean, non-GAAP is going to grow faster in Q4 than Q3 and GAAP definitely because like I mentioned in my opening comments, the deconversion impact on Q3 is just huge compared to last year. John Davis : Okay. No, that's fair. And you touched on it a little bit. I just wanted to focus on payments in the quarter for a second. Maybe talk a little bit about the pieces. How is bill pay doing? I assume some of the weakness in this quarter is just from lower transactions, but maybe if you kind of normalized for transactions like what payments would have grown? Just trying to understand kind of the pieces there and how we should think about that as the economy recovers? David Foss : Yes. So you're absolutely right on. So, overall transaction count in the payments business is up around 11% year-over-year for the same quarter. So, payments volume is back as far as I'm concerned, but it is bill pay that is the kind of the lagger. So bill pay is only up about 2% year-over-year. It's a very mature business, just not growing very fast. And we are continuing to add customers, but nowhere near the pace that we were several years ago. So between the card platform and then don't forget our ACH origination platform, that continues to grow with real-time payments and all the fun stuff we're doing there. People tend to think of ACH as being old. And of course, it has been around for a long time, but it still grows rapidly. There is still a lot of volume going through that platform as well. So between our ACH origination platform and the card platform, we're -- growth is back, I guess, I'll put it that way. John Davis : Okay. And I think pre-pandemic, you guys had talked about approaching double-digit growth in payments. Is there any reason why once everything comes back and normalize for the pandemic, that's not still on the table? Kevin Williams : Well, I mean, yes, Jay, I mean, we talked about that. And I think that's still an extreme possibility. But again, like I said, in my comments, as long as the economy continues to open up and pick up and goes forward. With some of the new wins that we're having on both debit and credit and even on our bill pay and direct bill pay, I think payments could get back closer not to double-digit growth. John Davis : Okay. And last one for me. Kevin, the margin was obviously quite a bit better this quarter. The margin guide, I guess, the implied guide would assume that maybe not all of this is sustainable, considering you get 90 basis points in 4Q from the payments platform migration. So just trying to think about, is there potential upside to the margin? Or are you guys -- was there anything specific in this quarter that's more kind of onetime-ish? And any changes to the, call it, 50 to 75 basis points of kind of normalized operating leverage once we kind of get the other side of the pandemic in the payments platform migration? David Foss : Yes, JD, so that's a good question. Obviously, there's a lot of moving parts, a lot of strange things going on in our financials right now. Is there some potential upside for Q4? Not absolutely, but when you look at Q3, I mean, some of the big savings we got were definitely travel-related because our people just aren't moving because of restrictions and different things, but that also impacts revenue. So as I made some open comments, I mean, license, hardware, implementation, billable travel is all down. And so, when we do get to start traveling again, the travel expense will go up and we -- and our salespeople are starting to get out there and move a little bit, and some of our installs are moving a little bit more. So our travel cost is going to go up. Yes, some of that's billable, which also increased revenue. But remember that in our business, the revenue is all kind of delayed. So even though our travel expenses may go up and other costs go up, the revenue related to that travel is probably not going to happen for a quarter or more. So there's potential for some negative impact on margins in the short term, but it's going to drag along all that revenue. So, you're absolutely right, there is some potential upside from our Q4. And once we get past this and into more of a regular cadence, I think we can go right back into that regular margin expansion that we've seen historically. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of [Nik Rima] from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : I just wanted to follow up on the core segment. I mean just given the RFP pipeline strength that you guys have been calling out since like last summer and into the fall and this quarter. I mean, should we start to see an inflection back towards pre-COVID levels of new core wins in the core segment, starting in the back half of '21 or early 22? And then just as my follow-up, how should we think about the impacts of the core segments growth next year, just given the relatively lower level of new wins since COVID began? David Foss : Yes. There's a ton of secondary questions you've asked there, but what to expect. The best guidance I can give you there is that the pipeline, the incoming pipeline as far as the deal volume that we're working today is back to the level that it was pre-pandemic. Now, can I predict exactly when things will sign and close? That's -- it's more art than science when it comes to timing on those things. But if we assume that we'll win at the same rate that we're winning pre-pandemic, and we know that the pipeline is at about the same level as it was pre-pandemic. Logically, we can assume, I think, that sometime later this calendar year, the rate of wins will be similar to what we were experiencing pre-pandemic. And then the thing to keep in mind is once we sign a new core deal, the revenue doesn't hit the P&L. The majority of the revenue doesn't hit the P&L, oftentimes for at least a year afterwards. And once we start a conversion, that conversion is a major impact to the financial institution, as I was highlighting earlier. Some people call it rip and replace where you're taking everything out and replacing it with a brand-new system. Well, that takes many months of planning and operation to get that conversion completed. So, the revenue -- the big chunk of revenue normally follows often times a year after we've signed the contract or announced a win. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Ken Suchoski of Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Ken Suchoski : I was just wondering, if you could talk about how you expect your new sales to trend as the economy reopens? It looks like the sales pipeline is quite strong. And I was just curious if you expect that to accelerate as you get back into seeing these customers in person. So any expectation there would be really helpful? David Foss : Yes. It's a good question. As I highlighted in my opening comments, the quarter we just finished was the fifth largest sales booking quarter we've ever had in the history of the Company. Well, that's pretty good. So saying that I expect it to accelerate significantly probably isn't a reasonable position to take. But what I do expect, as we just talked about in the last question is more on the core signing side. I expect as we go forward that we'll start to see more on the core signing side. The thing that will be interesting to watch is, can we sustain the pace that we've seen on the complementary side because if we can increase core bookings and sustain the complementary bookings, that's significant. That's meaningful. I'm not ready to say that, that's achievable, but that will certainly be our objective. And I think we have the opportunity to do that because we're getting all of this great recognition for some of this wonderful technology that we've been rolling out here, particularly in the area of digital. So, we'll have to see how that goes as time goes forward, but that's my hope. Ken Suchoski : That's helpful. I guess just a longer-term margin question. I mean, it looks like your margins have declined versus where they were maybe six to seven years ago. I mean, can you just talk about the main drivers of that? And is there an opportunity to get those margins back to those levels or even above those levels? Kevin Williams : Yes. So the big thing, I mean, if you're going to go back six or seven years, and you really can't go back that far because you can really only go back to 2017 because when we restated for ASC 606, that was the farthest back we went. So, you really can't look beyond that and get a true comparison of margins because ASC 606 definitely changed how we recognize revenue and had a significant impact on margins. But from '17 forward, the primary impact on our margins has been two things. One, the migration to the new card platform has increased our cost because we haven't been able to reduce any cost until we get through the migration, which as Dave said in his opening comments, is going to be complete at the end of March. So we will start to see that cost savings. We'll see a nice rebound in margins in Q4 and then a full year of that cost reduction in FY '22. The other thing that's happened since '17 is we have literally sold no new core business. So, there's been virtually no new core license revenue, which is very high-margin business happening in the last three or four years. I mean, on the bank side, I think we have sold maybe three or four in-house deals since 2017, on the crediting side, not bearing any more than that. And most of those were smaller bank deals for our core director solution. So, those are the two primary drivers as COGS that margin come down. Now what's going to happen is, like I said, you'll see margin improve in Q4. We'll continue to see it improve in the following year. We have gone through the transition of getting -- I mean, our license and hardware revenue is now very small percentage of our total revenue, so very little impact from that. So, as we continue to migrate our on-prem customers to our private cloud and continue to sell additional card business and our private cloud business continues to become a much larger percentage of our total revenue, that's a very high-margin business. Our margins will continue to grow and get back to the historical rates in FY '23 and beyond. Ken Suchoski : That makes a lot of sense. And if I could just squeeze one last one here. Just that divestiture, what was the revenue impact in the base here that you're assuming for the full year? I know you gave it for the three months and the six months, but just curious what the full year impact was? Kevin Williams : So, the revenue for the core business, that's really what we sold, was the core business of crews, which was 140 very small credit unions that we divested October 1, and the quarterly revenue from that was right at $1.2 million, just like represented in the press release this quarter. So, the total for this fiscal year on the GAAP to non-GAAP adjustment will be just under $3.7 million for the three quarters in this fiscal year. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Kevin for closing remarks. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Jay. First of all, I want to let everybody know that we are planning an Analyst Day this spring, the virtual event. And again, it will be held virtual. It's planned to be held on Tuesday, May 11, so please mark your calendars to save the date. We will be sending out an invitation with a schedule of events, timing and an online registration soon, and it will be sent to individuals. Please don't share it because we want to know who's actually attending this virtual event, but please be looking for this invite in your e-mail inbox in the near future. Now to wrap up the call, we are very pleased with the overall results from our ongoing operations. I want to thank all of our associates for the way they have handled these challenges by taking care of themselves and our customers and continue to work hard to improve our company on so many fronts for the future. All of us at Jack Henry continue to focus on what is best for our customers and our shareholders. With that, I want to thank you again for joining us today. And Jay, if you would please provide the replay number, I'd appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions].  Please be advice that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Kevin Williams. Thank you. Please go ahead. Kevin Williams : Thanks Brandy. Good morning and thank you all for joining us for the Jack Henry & Associates Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer. And on the call with me today is David Foss, our President and CEO. In just a minute, I will turn the call over to Dave to review some of his thoughts about the state of our business, our financial and sales performance for the quarter, some comments regarding the industry in general, and how we're dealing with COVID-19 and some other key initiatives that we have in place. And after Dave concludes his comments, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market close. And provide comments regarding our guidance for our FY 2021 which we've also provided in the release yesterday, and then we will open the line up for Q&A. First, I need to remind you that this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those, which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. Also on this call, we would discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found in yesterday's press release. I will now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased to report another quarter of revenue and operating income growth and an overall solid performance by our business. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our third fiscal quarter. For Q3 of fiscal 2021, total revenue increased 1% for the quarter and increased 6% on an on-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were down more than $18 million over the prior year quarter, which impacts revenue in the current quarter negatively, but as I've highlighted many times in the past, this is good news for our company if you take a long-term view. Turning to the segments, we again have a good quarter in the core segment of our business revenue decreased 4% for the quarter, because of the reduction in deconversion fees, but increased by 3% of non-GAAP basis. Our payment segment performed very well posting a 7% increase in revenue this quarter, and a 10% increase on an non-GAAP basis. We also had a strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses with a 1% increase in revenue this quarter and a 5% increase on an non-GAAP basis. As I mentioned in the press release, our core sales teams had an extremely solid quarter and are now seeing core activity consistent with our pre-pandemic run rate. During the quarter we inked 15 competitive core takeaways, which is greater than the one per week run rate we saw in 2019. In addition to our success signing new core clients, we signed six existing on-premise core customers to move to our private cloud environment. As we continue to push into the larger regional bank space, I think it's significant to note that of the 15 new core deals in the quarter, five were with multibillion-dollar asset banks and credit unions. As a reminder, regarding the topic of new core wins, at Jack Henry, we only call out new core deals when a bank or credit union moves their entire core processing relationship from a competitor system to a Jack Henry core solution. We do not announce them as a new core win if they move from one Jack Henry core to another or if they simply purchase a new module from us. Think of it as a new logo on the Jack Henry core customer list that wasn't there previously. In addition to the tremendous success we saw with our core business this quarter, we continue to sign new clients to our new digital offerings. During the third quarter, we signed 42 new clients to our Banno platform, and we continue to see increased interest in this offering as well as the rest of our digital suite. In our April 6th press release regarding digital momentum, we shared that we had more than 400 financial institutions and more than 4.3 million users live on the Banno platform. As of May 1st however, we have added several more financial institutions and we now have just over 5 million users live. We continue to enjoy the highest consumer rating in the App Store, and we are regularly recognized as the fastest application in the industry. As I've said before, I expect our success in this area to grow as we continue to add new functionality and features to the platform. Regarding the ongoing migrations of our new card processing platform, as of the end of March, we have successfully completed the migration of all of our debit processing customers to the new platform, in accordance with the plan we've been discussing for more than three years. Here are a few statistics regarding this remarkably successful project. We did our first migration on October 30, 2017, and completed the project on March 26, 2021. That's 1,243 days. During that time, we migrated 879 customers and added 151 new debit and credit customers to the platform. We currently support 1,030 banks and credit unions on the platform, and we're adding new clients every month. You will start to see the larger positive impact of this completed project on our financials in the fourth fiscal quarter. As we have emphasized throughout the process. I'm very proud of our team and thankful to our partners and clients for working with us to achieve such a successful outcome. As you've probably heard, M&A has become a topic again among bankers now that they're more confident about their operating models and the overall economy. Several of our clients who have approached us recently to work with them as they prepare to complete acquisitions of smaller institutions. In fact, the CEOs of two regional banks currently processed by Jack Henry, were quoted in an American banker article last week regarding their desire to pick up where they left off, before the pandemic brought everything to a halt. We expect our activity and what we refer to as the convert merge area of our business to pick up again as we get into the summer months and new deals are announced. Speaking of American banker, hopefully you all saw their article last month, announcing that once again, Jack Henry has been recognized by their team as a best place to work in Fintech. American banker only recognizes 50 companies each year, and as you can probably imagine, almost all of the companies on the Fintech list generate less than $100 million in annual revenue, pretty much in keeping with the type of company most people think of when they hear the word Fintech. We are particularly proud of this recognition for a few reasons. First, the scores are based on surveys conducted with our employees by an independent agency. Second, this is our fifth year in a row to receive this designation from American banker. Third, we are many times larger than almost any other company on the list, and forth, none of our larger competitors have ever made this list. I think this recognition is indicative of the culture, entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to developing truly innovative solutions found within the teams at Jack Henry. As you have undoubtedly already noted from yesterday's press release, we purchased a significant number of shares in the quarter with a lack of good quality acquisitions for us to pursue, and with our stock at an attractive price, we worked with the board to authorize an additional repurchase under the existing plan, which enabled us to buy 1,825,000 shares during the quarter. This significant share repurchase does not foreshadow a change in our strategy in this regard. We will continue to be opportunistic in our approach to purchasing our own shares, as we have excess cash and a lack of acquisition targets that fit our strategy. Hopefully, you've all seen the press release we posted this morning, announcing the upcoming retirement of our longtime Chairman, Jack Prim. Of course many of you know Jack is the guy who sat in this chair before I became CEO at Jack Henry. As I said in today's press release, Jack has given many years to our company as a business leader, a board member and a friend to us all. He has had a significant impact on the success of our company and on me personally. And for that, I want to sincerely thank him on behalf of all of us at Jack Henry. Recognizing that Jack has been considering a potential retirement for some time, we were prepared for his decision and expect our process to allow us to fill the vacancy close in time to Jack's retirement date. We hope to have more information to share regarding a new board member and the new chairman before the end of June. Slowly but surely our customers are settling into a new mode of operation with the anticipation of most COVID restrictions being lifted in the coming months. We're still operating with well over 90% of our employees working full time remote. We are committed to our return to office date of July 1st. We are finalizing plans for office usage and staffing that will employ a hybrid work from home, work in office strategy, and we will continue to leverage remote sales and implementation tools where possible. We still have some work to do and some things to learn. And I'm very optimistic variable about our ability to be successful as the work environment shifts again, post COVID. As we look toward the end of our fiscal year, our sales pipeline is very robust, and we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our customers, our ability to expand our customer relationships, the spending environment, and our long term prospects for success. I look forward to seeing and chatting with many of you at a Virtual Analysts Conference next week. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin Williams : Thanks Dave. For the quarter, our services and support revenue decreased 6% in the third quarter fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter year ago. However, adjusting that services and support revenue for deconversion fees of $4,367,000 in the current quarter, and deconversion fees of $22.8 million and revenue from divestitures last year in the prior fiscal quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, this revenue line would have grown actually 2% for the quarter compared to the previous year, which obviously as Dave mentioned, that has a lot of pressure and headwinds for our convert merge revenue, and also hardware in the quarter. Year to-date, our deconversion fees are now down $33 million compared to the prior year, which if you remember the guidance that we provided back in August, that is right in line with the full year impact. Services and support revenue primary driver was data processing and hosting fees and our private and public cloud offerings, which continues to show strong growth in the quarter compared to the previous year. However, the growth in that line was totally offset by the decrease in our product delivery and services revenue, which again was due to our decreased hardware, implementation revenue for on-prem customers, convert merge implementation, which is also down to the significant decrease in M&A activity, pass-through revenues that is related to billable travel, primarily related to travel limitations related to COVID. And then obviously deconversion fee revenue for the quarter compared to the prior year quarter, which is down almost $18 million. Processing revenue increased 13% in third quarter fiscal 2021, compared to the same quarter last year. This increase is primarily driven by higher card volumes for new customers installed last year, and also increased debit card usage from existing customers. Our Jack Henry digital revenue experienced the highest percentage of growth of all revenue lines in both Q3 and year to-date this year, compared to the same periods last year. Our total revenue was up 1% for the quarter compared to last year on a GAAP basis, and was up 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Cost of revenue was up 4% compared to last year second quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our card processing platform, and higher personnel costs related to increase headcount in March 31 compared to a year ago. The increase in costs was partially offset by travel expense savings as a result of COVID travel limitations. Our research development expense decreased 3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 over the prior fiscal year. This decrease was primarily due to a higher percentage of costs being capitalized for product development as we continue to invest in our products this quarter compared to a year ago. Our SG&A expense decreased 6% in the second quarter fiscal 2021 over the same quarter, and this decrease was primarily due to travel related savings. Our reported consolidated operating margins decreased from 21.4% last year to 21%. This year, which is primarily due to the various revenue headwinds already pointed out an increased cost. However, on a non-GAAP basis, our operating margins increased nicely. And we saw a strong margin expansion from 18.1% last year to 20.3% this year, primarily due to the items already mentioned. Our payments segment margins were impacted by deconversion fees in the quarter. But on a non-GAAP basis, our payments margin improved slightly with the completion of the platform migration. Both our core and complimentary segments had a decrease in GAAP margins, both of them had a nice increase in non-GAAP margins. So our underlying operations continue to be very strong as we move forward through the year. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was $21.5%, up from 19.7% in the same quarter year ago. This increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the change in the timing of the release of respective reserves for uncertain tax positions, resulting from varying statute of limitation periods. Our net income was $71.4 million in third quarter compared to $73.9 million last year, with earnings per share of $0.95 for the current quarter compared to $0.96 last year. For cash flow, our total amortization increased 3% year to-date compared to last year due to capitalized projects being placed into service in the prior year. Included in this total amortization is amortization and intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased $13.3 million or to $13.3 million this year, compared to $15.4 million last year. Depreciation is up 3% primarily due to CapEx in the previous year, and those assets being placed in the service. As Dave mentioned, we've purchased $2.5 million shares year to-date for $384.4 million, and we paid dividends of just right at $100 million for a total return to shareholders of $484.2 million year to-date. Our operating cash flow was $266.3 million for the first time nine months of fiscal year, which is down a little from $276 million last year, which is also impacted by the significant decrease in deconversion fees this year to-date, compared to last year. We invested $116.7 million back into our company through CapEx and capitalized software year to-date. Our free cash flow which is operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software and then adding back net proceeds from disposal of assets is $155.8 million year to-date. Couple of comments on our balance sheet. Our cash position is $70.1 compared to $109.5 million years ago, so we still has a decent cash for operations. We did draw down $200 million on a revolver during the quarter to fund our stock buybacks. But we have no other long term debt our balance sheet other than operating leases. Our return on invested capital for our trailing 12 months is 19.2%, and our return on equity for the trailing 12 months is 20.9%, which is very solid. For update on guidance, we did update both our GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance in the press release yesterday for the full fiscal year. However, just to be clear, this guidance continues to be based on the assumption that the country continues to open up and the economy continues to improve. But if things do go differently then obviously this guidance will be revised. We've been very consistent with our GAAP guidance that revenue from deconversion fees would be a decrease of approximately $33 million covered last year, which we hit that mark as I previously said during our fiscal Q3. And it now appears that deconversion revenue will actually be down by another $4 million in Q4 compared to the previous year, for a total decrease of approximately $37 million in deconversion fees compared to the last fiscal year. We continue to see no immediate M&A activity that would drive deconversion revenue at this point, which in the short term will hurt and will continue to hurt our revenue growth for the fiscal year. But in the long term as we've always said, we don't like deconversion revenue as we would much rather keep the customer and the revenue for the long term. This means based on the GAAP revenue guidance provided in the press release impacted by the decrease deconversion fees, we expect GAAP revenue growth and FY 2021 to be 3 to 3.5%. The adjusted between GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance for FY 2021 is the decrease in deconversion fees compared to previous year and the small revenue impact from the cruise divestiture during Q2 that was removed from FY 2020. for comparison purposes. For non-GAAP revenue growth guidance provided in the release, we're now guiding to approximately 6% growth due to the ongoing headwinds previously discussed in the various lines of revenue. So we still anticipate we're going to grow 6% this year, which means Q4 is going to have a really nice revenue growth to get our slightly less than 5% year to date up to that 6% for the year. We anticipate GAAP operating margins for the full year of FY 2021 to be down slightly at about 22% compared to last year for all the reasons further discussed. And non-GAAP margins should actually improve slightly compared to last year for the entire fiscal year, similar to what we've seen to the first three quarters. Our effective tax rate for the full year of FY 2021 should be in line with that FY 2020 rate at around 22%, assuming there are no federal or state tax law changes between now and the end of year that would impact our fiscal year. We've also increased our full year EPS guidance for FY 2021 again, this quarter, which we've provided last quarter range of $3.85 to $3.90. We are now updating our EPS guidance for FY 2021 to arrange $3.98 to $4.02. The increase in guidance is primarily due to expense control, margin improvement for the year and continued improved efficiencies which is offsetting the impact of deconversion fees. With that, this concludes our opening comments. And we are now ready to take questions. Brandy, will you please open the call lines up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Peter Heckmann : Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. Just in terms of the payment platform migration, Can you remind us the cost saves from closing down the two duplicative cloud platforms. And kind of just on a preliminary basis, what type of adjusted operating margin expansion you think that that sets us up for, for fiscal 2022? Kevin Williams : So, Pete, what we've always said is we're going to get at least a minimum of $16 million cost savings out of that, and we're still stick to that. Obviously, that's not going to all happen this quarter, and that's an annual run rate. We are in the process right now of decommissioning both those platforms. So there's -- all the costs, it is not going to be in this quarter. In fact, there's some other things that we're still having to do through the end of December, I believe, for some programming different things to get the full efficiencies out of the new platforms. So it's probably going to be Q3 of next fiscal year that we have the full quarterly impact of that $16 million plus savings, but we're going to start getting some this quarter. So you will see some payments, margin expansion in Q4. And then you'll see more in Q1 and Q2, and then even more in Q3 next year. Peter Heckmann : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just in terms of the marketplace and when you're talking to your financial institutions. Are there -- have there been any shifts in priorities over the last three to six months? What are the hot buttons products that folks are interested in? And could you give us an update? I think he gave us a number of Banno in the quarter, but maybe refresh us on a year to-day basis on some of the other newer solutions like treasury and loan origination. David Foss : Sure. So, its Dave, Pete. I won't say that there's been any major shifts in this quarter. We started to see a shift in the earlier in the fiscal year toward a heavy emphasis on digital and things that would allow our customer's customers. So whether it's a consumer or commercial customer, allow them to conduct more business without coming into the branch. So the digital platform has, of course been right at the front of that list. I'll reemphasize what I said in my opening comments here. In the press release, we put up on April 6th, we said, we had around 400 institutions and 4.3 million users live month later, on May 4, we now have more than 5 million users live. So it really I think emphasizes the dramatic shift that's happening among banks and credit unions to ensure that their consumers and their commercial customers have best-of-breed digital technology for them views. So that's been a key driver for our customers and certainly for us. Treasury is another piece of that -- another piece of that puzzle. So I didn't call it out. And we have 12 -- so far this year, as far as treasury new customers that are assigned to the treasury platform. Again, that's a move toward a more digital functionality. But for very large commercial customers, you don't install a treasury solution unless you have really large commercial customers, otherwise, they just use cash management. So that I think is indicative. And then on the lending side, I've highlighted this many times, that's allowing a commercial customer to do complex commercial loans online without having to drive to the branch for their financial statements and all that packet of information. The thing that we have just recently done there is we've added this lending marketplace functionality where customers, if they have a credit that's too large for them to book, they can essentially sell that credit through a marketplace to other lenders who want to take on the responsibility for that credit. So there's a lot of activity in all those areas. But it is this shift for doing business more in a digital environment as opposed to coming into the branch. That's what's driving all of those things that I just touched on. Peter Heckmann : Got it. Thanks. So just housekeeping. Kevin, what would you say would be ending diluted shares for the period? Kevin Williams : It\u2019s around 75, right. David Foss : Yes. That's right around 75, Pete. Peter Heckmann : 75. Okay. Thanks much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Hey. Good morning, Dave and Kevin. Dave, I was just wondering if you could talk about what you think the backlog has been for your sales pipeline. I know you talked about it last quarter, and seems like things were really improving. Now, I'm wondering if that momentum is continued, and/or if there's any headwinds, because you might still not be able to see your customers face to face? David Foss : Actually, Kartik, that's one of the real pieces of good news and all this. And that's why I use the word robust pipeline in the press release. We have really successfully shifted to enabling our sales team and customers being accepting of doing business remote. They still like to have people come in once a while, and some customers insist on the sales rep coming in. But we're doing a lot of this remote, a lot of the demonstrations that we do now are -- normally, where we would have would have had five or six people on site, we'll maybe have one or two on site. And the other four are on a team's call or on a zoom call doing the demonstration. So that's where it's a really become to -- gotten the point where they'll accept that idea of much of the sale happening virtually. And so what that's created now is, and I think I've said this on calls before, we -- a good gauge for us of how stout our sales pipeline is, is if we are at about 90% of our annual quota. So not a monthly quota, but the annual quota at any given time on any given day, if we have about 90% of the annual quota in the pipeline, then we know that we've got enough happening that we should be able to make our number. We are right at that mark right now. And so what that tells me is, customers are engaging with us. They have salespeople working with them on deals. And we're kind of back to a normal run rate that we would have seen in 2019. That's what we're seeing today in the sales pipeline. So the number of engagements and the volume of deals that are flowing through the pipe are about where we were in 2019. Kevin Williams : And Kartik, the other part of your questions that the backlog. I mean, remember, and we've talked about this for years, the vast majority of our products have anywhere from a nine to 18 month backlog of installs at any given time. And so, we have some of those backlogs have gotten a little smaller, but all of our backlogs, all our products are still very solid, very strong. And as Dave mentioned on his opening comments, we signed 15 new core deals, and none of those are going to be installed this fiscal year. Those are all going to be next year. So, all those are going into our backlog along with all the other products are being sold. Kartik Mehta : And so, Kevin, I know, you don't want to talk too much about FY 2022. But based on Dave's comments and your comments, is there any reason that you shouldn't be able to continue to accelerate top line? I'm not talking about going from 6% to 9%. But at least continue to see modest improvement in top line? Kevin Williams : Yes. I mean, obviously Kartik, we're just starting the budget process for next year. But I feel very comfortable that revenue growth next year will be stronger than it was this year. Again, obviously, as the economy continues to grow and do what I do, just getting through, and Dave, can you jump in here. Just getting through the payments migration. And now we can focus totally on adding new customers instead of migrating all of our existing customers. Because that was such a major feat to get that done without disrupting our customers. I mean, that alone should help drive some nice payment growth, our remote deposit capture -- I don't check conversion is not sexy, but it just continues to be a major grower force. And then as we get back to the new core winds that we've seen and the migrations from end to out, guys, I see no reason why our revenue growth next fiscal year can't be up nicely from where it was this year. Kartik Mehta : Well, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. ISI. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Could you comment on the sustainability of this improvement in the quarter to 15 core deals up from what we've seen prior to this during COVID of about six to seven? Is this the new high watermark that you're shooting for in the next kind of 12 months or so? David Foss : Yes. I don't have a crystal ball, Dave. So I can't give you exact prediction. But what we are seeing today, as I've quoted in my in my comments, we are back to the runway that we saw in 2019. And I talked about it many times on the calls of the time that we were on this run rate of booking one competitive takeaway per week. Can I say with absolute certainty that we're going to do 52 deals next year? No. But it's certainly the pace right now, and everything that we see in the pipeline for the next coming months, the pace is, is definitely greater than it has been during, during COVID-19, during the depths of COVID-19, I guess I'll put it that way. And it's logical. I don't think anybody should be surprised that there was a slowdown in those core decisions during the pandemic. Because as we've talked about before, when you're the CEO of a bank or credit union, and you decide to switch out your core, that's essentially making a decision to do heart and lung transplant all at the same time for your institution. And it's a very disruptive, no matter how smooth it goes, it's a disruptive process. And why would you make that decision unless you absolutely have to? Why would you make that decision in the midst of a global pandemic? And so I think it's totally logical that we're back to that pace all. If you take COVID out of the picture, all the other reasons for a customer to move to Jack Henry, those are all they're still just like they were in 2019. And so I think these bank and credit union executives are seeing that now. They know how to manage through in the COVID world. And now they're back to thinking about how do I find the best-of-breed provider on the core side. And let's go talk to Jack Henry. David Togut : Thanks for that. And just as a follow up, what are your preliminary expectations for fiscal 2022 adjusted operating margin? Kevin, you noted that you would complete the full platform conversion in payments by the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Does that lead to a significant margin boost next year? David Foss : Well, let's be clear here. The platform conversion is done. All the customers have moved off the legacy platform. So we're done with the conversion. It's the follow on, you can't just flip the light switch and say, okay now, everything's turned off. So that's what Kevin was alluding to, and sorry to talk over. Kevin Williams : You're fine. So yes, I mean, maybe there is going to be a nice margin expansion next year. I mean, as I said earlier, that our non-GAAP is going to finish up pretty much in line and slightly up from where it was last year. It's -- we will gain more than 100 bps in operating margin, FY 2022. And couldn't be more than that? Yes. But I think, as I said earlier, it's going to take us some additional time. As Dave just said, to get all these costs taken out. And it's actually going to be by the end of the second quarter, I believe, when we get all the costs taken out. So you're going to see some continued margin improvement throughout next fiscal year. And it'll be Q3 when you see the full impact of what the cost take out for the payment migration. But as we continue to add new payments customers, as we continue to add new core customers, as we continue to migrate our on-prem customers to private cloud, all those things will help our margins. The other thing that, I think a lot of people forget about is with the M&A activity, obviously, our deconversion fees are down. But on the other side that is in our both our GAAP and non-GAAP numbers is what -- and Dave alluded to it is on the comments is our convert merge revenue. Because our customers do a lot of acquiring as well. So we've had some significant headwinds this fiscal year on our convert merge revenue, we have done the risks or layoffs. So we still have all the costs. So just having some of the M&A activity pick up, will not only give us back some deconversion fee revenue, which we really don't want, that also help with convert merge revenue, which that will also help our operating margins. So there's so many positive things, it's going to help our operating margins as things get back to normal, Dave. David Togut : Understood. Thank you very much. David Foss : One, one comment I'll add here while you're shifting to a new question. I didn't call it out in my comments. But just since Dave asked about, the impacts of this platform conversion. Kevin pointed out that we're continuing to add new customers. I didn't call it in my comments. But we added 13 more brand new customers to that platform during the quarter. So this really is a growth driver for us now that we're through the migration. We're continuing to add customers to that platform net new. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Comery with G Research. Steve Comery : Hey, good morning. I was actually going to get to ask him about that. You know, just some high level thoughts on the feedback from customers. Now that the card platform has totally transitioned. Any momentum selling the new platform and kind of just general high level thoughts on what the opportunity is there? David Foss : Yes. Thank you, Steve. It really has been -- the word I -- the words that I used in my opening comments were about how amazing and successful this conversion has been. I mean, this has been a huge effort and are -- so we've migrated all these customers. We've added 150 new customers, now another 13 in this quarter, that weren't doing business with us before on the card platform. We are now positioned to sell credit and have been selling credit, which of course, we didn't have before we put this new platform in place. Customer response has been terrific. Our customers are much happier. They're definitely referenceable, which is what's leading through all of these successes in signing new customers to the platform. So it really has been the right move for Jack Henry. It was a long term project. And there was pain along the way, because you're disrupting all these customers. But it really was the right decision, has been a good move for us for our customers. And so, we're well positioned for growth in the future. And one thing I'll emphasize that we've talked about on previous calls, haven't talked about in a while. But our old platform was dependent on Jack Henry core system for the old debit platforms to function. This new platform is not dependent on a Jack Henry core system, which means, we can sell debit and credit outside the Jack Henry core base, which we couldn't do in the past. And so now we are positioned to start doing that as well as adding new customers from within the Jack Henry core base. Steve Comery : Yes. And actually, my next question is on the same topic is that as well. So Banno, I think historically has been primarily marketed to Jack Henry core customers. Just any sort of thoughts on the puts and takes, as far as marketing that outside the Jack Henry Core base? Or is there still a lot of empty space to go into current Jack Henry core customers there? David Foss : Yes. It's a good question. There is a lot of opportunity within the Jack Henry core base. And what I've highlighted in the past is, we are intensely focused right now on delivering Banno business, which is the other big chunk. So Banno so far has been positioned as a consumer application. Banno business will be delivered later this year. And by the way, those of you who attend the Analyst Day next week, and who runs digital for us is going to update you on that Banno business and kind of what that means for us. But Banno business will be delivered later this calendar year. And so once we have Banno consumer and Banno business all up and running and live and good to go, then we start selling outside the Jack Henry core base. So that'll be later in 2020 -- calendar 2022 is when we'll start selling outside the core base. But we want to make sure that we have everything tightened right with our core customers before we start to go after sales outside the Jack Henry core base. But we definitely will be doing that. And right now the target is late calendar 2022. Kevin Williams : And I'll just had one thing to that. So, if you think about Steve, and right now we are at about just over 20% of our core customers that are using Banno. So, we've got an enormous amount of runway. And obviously, as Dave said, we want to take care of our core customers. The other thing I'd point out is we've actually and I've never seen this, I've been in this business for a long time. I've never seen a complementary product, actually win a core deal. And we've actually won some very nice core wins, because we're only selling Banno to our core customers. So it's -- that's another reason to make sure we've taken care of all our core -- our own core customers before we start going outside the base. Steve Comery : Then the just one final clarification there on the Banno consumer versus Banno business? Is the revenue opportunity similar for each product? Or how would you handicap that? Kevin Williams : That's a good question. I would say, a commercial customer tends to pay more for that functionality than a consumer does. But you don't have as many of them to work with at each institution. So, depending on the makeup of the institution, if they're highly commercial focused, I'd say there's a greater opportunity at that institution. If they're primarily consumer focused retail, then there's a lesser opportunity. So it just depends on the institution, the makeup of the institution. But if they're heavily commercial, there is a significant opportunity once we roll out that functionality. So, we'll go around to our existing customers who are running Banno consumer, you'll be first on the list to say, okay, now we have a Banno for business, let's add that and that will be essentially the easy button for those customers that have already deployed Banno for their consumer base. Steve Comery : Thank you very much for taking my question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Davis with Raymond James. John Davis : Hey, good morning, guys. Kevin, just want to start out on the margin. I think 3Q was a good bit better than like we and most people expected, but then the 4Q guide I think implies a little bit of a deterioration. Historically you've seen a little bit of a hiccup in 4Q. So maybe just know the puts and takes of the margin sequentially as we enter the fourth quarter here? Kevin Williams : Yes., So part of that JD is Q3. I mean, obviously, we had some very nice savings from travel related savings costs. We are starting to pick up travel again. In fact, our corporate travel is almost back to where it was pre COVID. Commercials not quite there yet. But I think travel is going to pick back up even more in Q4, which is -- and that's really the only negative I see happening on the margins in Q4. Everything else is pretty much where it should be. Again, we're not seeing a lot of convert merge revenue, which those are very nice margins for us. And I think as M&A starts picking up and Dave mentioned in his comments, there is starting to be a lot of clamor out there about M&A. And a lot of our customers are wanting to get back to us. So I think that's going to pick right back up next fiscal year, but I just don't see it happening yet in Q4. John Davis : Okay. That's helpful. And then, any comments on stimulus impacts? Was there in the guide before that's what's driving the modest uptick in the non-GAAP deconversion fee revenue. Just curious if you guys have seen any kind of impact on your debit processing business from stimulus? Kevin Williams : So there has been some impact on the debit business, we haven't tried to quantify that as a separate standalone numbers. Certainly there has been a significant growth on the debit business. The interesting thing is stimulus payments have definitely been a driver for growth in digital, so not just for Banno but for anybody who's out there in this space. Because customers who have been looking to access that money and manage their money through the digital channel, that has been a driver in transaction volume, and also in growth of users. I think that's across the industry. Because so many consumers now have been actively trying to manage those stimulus payments. But as far as debit volume, we haven't tried to carve that out and, and segregate the impact of stimulus from the rest of the volume, it's just baked in the numbers. John Davis : Okay. Thanks. And then, Kevin, it's been a long time since I've seen you guys be as aggressive on the buyback. My math, right, you guys spent about $275 million in the quarter on the buyback, obviously, still have a phenomenal balance sheet, plenty of firepower there. So any reason why maybe not to that level, but you wouldn't continue to buy back shares here? Just curious commentary. And maybe you can leave in if there's been any changes in the M&A environment, which I'm kind of doubting in given valuations, but just curious that too? Kevin Williams : So that's one of the things I tried to be clear about in my opening comments, JD was that this does not signal some significant change in our strategy. We've said time and time again, that if we have excess cash, we don't see a good acquisition on the horizon. We will do stock buybacks. We're committed to our dividend policy, but we'll do stock buybacks absent a good acquisition. One of the challenges that we've highlighted many times on these calls is, valuations are getting pretty high on these potential companies that we could acquire. Everybody has stars in their eyes about doing an IPO and/or possibly us back and getting some great big valuation. And so, absent, really solid acquisition that fits our strategy, share buybacks continue to be an option for us, particularly when the share price is down like it was here a few months ago. That's what really drove us to get more active with the board and make a significant move. John Davis : Okay. And that last one for me. Dave, maybe a little clear picture here. Just the competitive dynamics in the core segment. Maybe splice out credit unions versus banks. One of your competitors has made some noise about making some progress on credit unions lately. So just curious there if anything's changed through the pandemic, or kind of how you see it today? David Foss : Absolutely not. So, we have the deals that we won this year. We've won 17 competitive takeaways on the credit union side of the business. So very strong on the credit union side, no change with the competitive landscape. There is nobody winning as many deals as Jack Henry as far as new core displacement. And that was true before the pandemic. It is true today. I don't think anything of any significance has changed because of the pandemic with regard to our positioning on the core side or ability to win on the core side. John Davis : Okay. All right. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. Ken Suchoski : Hi, good morning, David and Kevin. Thanks. for taking my question. I think you mentioned that five out of the 15 core competitive takeaways were multibillion dollar institutions. And I believe Jack Henry historically has focused primarily on smaller institutions in the market. So can you talk about your appetite to move up market? And then, are there any features or capabilities you need to add to really push up market and be successful there? David Foss : Yes. That is a misconception that absolutely drives me nuts. Ken, I just got to say that right here. Jack Henry has been a player in the multibillion dollar space for well over 10 years. So if we were having this call 15 years ago, I would totally agree with what you just said. We were not a player in the multibillion dollar space. But for the past 10, 15 years, we have continued to grow in that space. We are the dominant player on the credit union side, almost 50%, then you'll see the numbers next week at the analyst conference, I quoted exactly off the top of my head, but close to 50% of the over a billion dollar credit unions run our Jack Henry Episys solution. So we are by far the dominant player. On the credit union side with a single platform. On the banking side, we have somewhere around 23% to 25%, of the multibillion dollar market running on almost all of them on our Silver Lake platform. We've continued to push up market. It is a key part of our strategy. We have continued to add functionality over the years and we are winning in that space regularly, just as I emphasized on the call today. So, we have -- we are not the little brother in the multibillion dollar banking space. We are definitely a player. The question for us is historically, we have been below about 50 billion. And so, one of the things that Stacy will talk about at the Analyst Day next week is that we are -- we do have an initiative to move above 50 billion, because that has not been a market that we've been in historically, we've been below 50 billion. But we have teams and we've been actively working in that space as well. So, we definitely are not targeting smaller banks. In fact, if you're a credit union below about 100 million in assets or a bank below about 200 million in assets. Then Jack Henry generally is not the fit. We're the fit for a right around a billion dollars is a real sweet spot for us. But as I mentioned, we've continued to grow up market here for many years. Ken Suchoski : Right. Okay. That's really helpful. And then, I guess, when we think about margins for fiscal year 2023, the platform migration will be behind you. I mean, what's the right way to think about margins, or even margin expansion after fiscal year 2022? And I'm just looking back at some numbers here. I mean, Jack Henry had a roughly 24% operating margin in fiscal year 2018. Is that, is that a good benchmark for fiscal year 2023? Kevin Williams : Yes, Probably. Its Kevin. I mean, once we get next year behind, just get FY 2022 behind us, and get the full benefit of the payment migration, platform migration. We should go back and FY 2023, to the typical 50 to 100 bp margin expansion that we saw historically, before we started. And if you think about, I mean, 2018 is, is now when we started this the payment, platform migration. So there was already some degradation on our margins, even in 2018, that kind of grew since then. So, we should see some nice margin -- very nice margin expansion in 2022. And again, in 2023. Ken Suchoski : Right. Yes, I think that's right. Yes. I think the margins came down about 30 bps, it looks like in 2018 versus 2017. And then just maybe one last question for me, I think if I do the math, right, you're going to accelerate your non GAAP revenue growth to kind of high single digits, maybe even low double digits here in fiscal 4Q. Can you talk about the sustainability of that growth rate? And do you think fiscal year 2022 can grow at a similar level? Or is it something below that a good assumption? Kevin Williams : No. So there's a couple of things that you got to remember. In Q4 is, we've got some pretty easy comps from last year, especially on the payment side. So you're right and your math, right. I mean, non-GAAP, you're going to see very high single digit growth, maybe even low double, but it's probably going to be in a 8% to 9% in Q4 to get us to that 6% non GAAP growth for the year. But like I answered a previous question, I think for FY 2022, you're probably going to see us grow faster than we did in FY 2021. There's not going to be high single digits. It's probably going to be in the 7% to 8% range like we saw before the pandemic hit. Ken Suchoski : Got it. Okay. Helpful. Thanks for taking my questions. Really appreciate it. Kevin Williams : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Hey, everybody. Thanks so much for taking my questions. You mentioned the $37 million decrease year-over-year in deconversion fees. And I'm actually not even asking about that. But what I'm curious about is the dynamic between winning new deals, and the lack of switching among your existing clients and how your retention rates have changed over time? And how that's really the retention rate is baked into your forecasts, moving forward? Thanks. David Foss : So the retention rate, our retention rate is incredibly high. And we talked about that regularly. The concern that you may have a little bit of a misconception about deconversion fees. So when we get deconversion fees, that's because one of our customers has been acquired by somebody else. And so they are buying their way out of the existing contract that we have. We have no control over whether somebody is being acquired by another institution. We do have a good track record of doing -- of saving those accounts by convincing the acquirer to switch to the Jack Henry system. Those are hard to do and it's rare that you are able to do that. Because the acquirer is making all the decisions and the acquiree is having to respond to those decisions. But we have several times convinced the acquiring bank to convert to the Jack Henry system. But those are hard. And those are those are rare. So what drives deconversion revenue is one of our customers being acquired away. It's not that they're angry with Jack Henry and decide to leave us and now they got to pay to get out of the agreement. It's 100% of the time, I'd say it's because they've been acquired by somebody else. So that really doesn't come into the retention rate conversation. And again, our retention rates are well into the upper 90s as far as the core base. Dominick Gabriele : Okay, great. And then maybe if you could talk about [Indiscernible] kind of a small item. But could you talk about the R&D expense, and kind of what some of the projects you're working on there? And where you're expecting your R&D expense to be trending over the next whatever timeframe, I guess, you feel like providing, that'd be really, really helpful? It was a little lower than I would have expected. Thanks. Kevin Williams : So we tend to run at about 14% of revenue all in for R&D. So it's cap software, its R&D expense, about 14% of revenue. And that's been five years, probably we've been at that number, more than five years. So about 14% of revenue for several years. That's a number I'm very comfortable with looking forward, because we're committed to doing these innovative new solutions. So talking to those solutions. Some of them we've talked about here. We have digital is on that list, continuing to do a lot of investment in digital, continuing to do investment in the treasury platform, because our larger -- banks that are serving larger commercial customers are continuing to look for additional functionality. So that's on the list as far as R&D projects is concerned. We have our -- the core systems, we're continuing to do investment. That's something that you never say you're done. There's always ongoing investment in the core systems with new functionality and new look and feel, the user experience is constantly being updated. Our lending platform. So I highlighted that a little while ago in this conversation. Lots of ongoing investment there to expand the functionality to allow our customers particularly on the commercial side to do online lending. But we've also in the past year or so been investing in new functionality for consumer lending and consumer deposits to deliver best-of-breed functionality when it comes to originating accounts online. And then the last I'd highlight is in the area of fraud. So a lot of investment going on in the fraud area of a new functionality to deliver a more digital experience, I guess around managing fraud for our customers. Kevin Williams : And Dominick, the other I think I remember and I agree 100% there. Our total all in for R&D and cap software is going to be 14%. The percentage of revenue that's in R&D expense on the P&L is going to fluctuate a little bit depending on the timing of projects. And when they actually start capitalizing and in capitalizing, because we obviously have to follow the accounting god's rules for capitalization. And so there may be times that the we're complete with projects and we're not really ready to start another project capitalizing. So that quarter R&D expense maybe 8% of total revenue. We're this quarter with 6%, because we actually were capitalizing a little higher percentage because we had so many projects as Dave just pointed out that were in flight. Dominick Gabriele : Great. Thanks. That's really, really helpful. I really appreciate it. And maybe just one more. Is there any difference between the conversations within your sales force between actually obtaining new credit union versus being clients as a whole? And I guess, all I'm asking is, is there one that's ready to re-accelerate their tech stack into the future versus one, and clearly, you guys are a big leader in the credit union space? So thank you so much. I really appreciate it. David Foss : Yes. It's an interesting question. I wouldn't say that the credit union industry or the banking industry, one is ahead of the other. Historically, credit unions have been more tech forward, I guess I'll put it that way. They've always been more apt to invest in technology just since even when I started in this business a long time ago. Credit unions have always put technology at the front of the line. They've used it as a differentiator against banks, and not just against big banks, but against banks, just in general. And part of their rationale has been that they have money to spend on technology. They don't -- they haven't historically built as many branches of banks have. They've tried to use technology to be the differentiator, but I don't think there's been any change recently, as far as one or the other, and of changing their profile or being more aggressive about going after new technology. Dominick Gabriele : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vasu Govil with KBW. Vasu Govil : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess my first question is just a clarification question on the revenue guide. The delta between the GAAP and the non GAAP, I think it was roughly $30 million prior quarter, and now it's about $17 million. But I think, Kevin, you talked about deconversion fees going down four to five million I thought. So like, what's, what's the remaining delta kind of you could provide? Some clarification there? Kevin Williams : Well, I mean, a lot of it happened this quarter, because as I mentioned in my opening comments, our convert merge revenue was not where we thought it was going to be this quarter. We're just not seeing the M&A activity. Hardware sales continued down, on-prem installation continue to be down. So it's really not -- the change was not really in Q4, it was really Q3. We came up a little short, as most of you pointed out in your first call notes. We had a we had a revenue miss. But yet we were still very efficient and actually expanded our margins and still exceeded EPS consensus guidance for the quarter and we raised it for the year. So yes, I mean, the delta changed a little bit. But it's really not a whole lot of impact on Q4 as what happened in Q3. Vasu Govil : Understood. And then I just continuing on the 3Q trends. The core and the payment segment, if I look at the non-GAAP growth rate, payments was a lot better in core improvements with a little bit less than we would have thought just given also the easier comps in core. So if you could talk about like the puts and takes and sort of what drove the growth rate and what you're expecting for the fourth quarter? Kevin Williams : So again, in core is because of on-prem installations and convert merge revenue not being where we thought they were going to be as we guide it. And we just don't see those coming back in Q4 either. Vasu Govil : Understood. And then I guess last one, sort of a broader question on the competitive environment. Several small point solution providers are sort of emerging, many of them are way public. How do you see that trend having an impact on your growth rates in the complimentary segment, if at all? David Foss : It's something that we watch pretty closely. And you're right, and that's essentially what I was alluding to earlier, when I was talking about the M&A environment. Those companies who maybe would have put themselves up for sale in the past and would have been a potential acquisition target for Jack Henry, all of them these days are thinking that they're going to IPO and so. I think it's just a little bit different than the number that are they're trying to IPO and take advantage of the frothiness in the market right now. But none of them are doing anything that's particularly, it's not threatened, particularly threatening to Jack Henry or new or different or anything like that. We are very well positioned to compete with the names that I think most of them that you would throw it at me, if you were to throw out names, I would tell you exactly how we're positioned and where we're positioned to compete with them. And we are not worried about our ability to compete with some of these folks there. They're taking advantage of the times and there's a lot of interest in Fintech right now and they're getting valuations that are exciting and we'll see where they sit five years from now. Vasu Govil : Thank you. That's helpful. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Kevin Williams : Okay. Thanks, Brandy. As a reminder, as Dave mentioned, our Virtual Analyst Day is scheduled next week, a week from today, actually, on Tuesday, May 11. It'll be beginning at one o'clock. If you have not registered, but you would like to you can contact Vance Sherard. That's vsherard@jackhenry.com. And he can send you a registration link to sign up for the event. Now wrap up the call. We're very pleased with the overall results from our ongoing operations. And I want to thank all of our associates for the way they've handled these challenges by taking care of themselves and our customers and continue to work hard to improve our company to continue moving forward for the future. All of us at Jack Henry continue to focus on what is best for our customers and our shareholders. With that, I want to thank you again for joining us today. And Brandy, would you please now provide the replay number for the call. Operator : Yes. And at this time, this does conclude today's conference call. But if you would like to listen to the replay, you may do so by dialing 1-800-585-8367. Again, that's 1-800-585-8367. Thank you. And have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Liz. Good morning. And thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry and Associates Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2021 year-end earnings call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO, and Treasurer. And on the call with me, today is David Foss, our Board Chair President, and CEO.  In just a minute, I will turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the Sabre business, financial and sales performance for the quarter, some comments regarding the industry in general, and then some other key initiatives that we have in place.  Then after Dave concludes his comments, I will provide some additional positive comments regarding the earnings press release we put out yesterday after market close. And provide comments regarding our guidance for our fiscal year of 2022 provided in the release, and then we will open the lines up for Q&A.  First, I need to remind you that this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends, or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements.  Also on this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non - GAAP revenue and non - GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found in yesterday's press release. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Kevin. And good morning, everyone. Today we're very pleased to share details with you of a quarter that produced record revenue and operating income, as well as record sales bookings.  As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our fourth quarter and for the entire fiscal year, particularly in light of the challenges posed by conducting business while dealing with the ongoing effects of the pandemic. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, total revenue increased 10% for the quarter and increased 10% on a non - GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were essentially flat as compared to the prior-year quarter. Turning to the segments, we had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 4% for the quarter and increased by 6% on a non - GAAP basis.  Our payments segment performed extremely well, posting a 16% increase in revenue this quarter and a 17% increase on a non - GAAP basis. We also had a strong quarter in our complimentary solutions businesses with a 7% increase in revenue this quarter and a 7% increase on a non - GAAP basis.  As I highlighted in our press release, the fourth quarter was the strongest sales quarter in the history of the Company. June was also the strongest Sales month ever, and it propelled all three Sales groups to exceed their quota for the quarter. While they were signing all those contracts in the fourth quarter, the sales team also did an outstanding job of refilling the pipeline with new opportunities to set us up for success going forward.  I think this is a good sign of the health of our market and bodes well for the start of the new sales year. In the fourth fiscal quarter, we booked 13 competitive core takeaways and 14 deals to move existing on-premise customers through our private cloud environment.  Several of our complementary offerings also saw very strong demand in the quarter with, as you might guess, our digital suite leading the pack. We signed 87 new clients to our Banno digital platform in the quarter, 10 new treasury management clients, and 22 new clients to our card processing solution.  For the full year, we signed 41 competitive core takeaways with 8 of them greater than 1 billion in assets. Additionally, we signed 35 contracts to move on-prem core clients to our private cloud, 219 new Banno digital customers, and 55 new clients for our card processing solution. Of course, we signed a variety of other contracts for many of our other solutions as well, but it's important to note that almost all of these contracts represent long-term recurring revenue commitments to Jack Henry for a wide variety of our solutions. At our analyst's conference in May, I shared with the attendees that we had just surpassed 5 million registered users on our Banno digital banking platform. As of the end of the fiscal year, we were at roughly 5.6 million registered users.  As a point of reference, on July 1st of 2020, we had about 3.2 million registered users. So in one year, we saw an increase of approximately 75% in our user count. This is significant because, as I've stressed in the past, most of the revenue for a business like this is tied to the number of users on the platform.  We continued to onboard clients and their users at a pace of about 30 financial institutions added to the platform each month. In addition to our ongoing success with Banno, we have delivered many new and innovative solutions during the fiscal year.  A few examples include, our Symitar team delivered an automated database migration to almost all of our EPS clients, which allowed them to move to the new database structure with no effort or client impact.  Our lending team delivered the Jack Henry loan marketplace, which allows banks and credit unions to easily engage through a digital experience in the buying, selling, and participation of loans. Our digital team delivered the Banno digital toolkit, which provides a complete set of application programming interfaces or APIs to enable easy plug-ins to third-party solutions in our digital platform. Our payment team continued the expansion of functionality and adoption of the PayCenter platform and delivered the Zelle digital toolkit to enable clients not using our digital platform to connect to the PayCenter hub for Zelle transactions.  And, of course, the payments group completed the 3 and 1/2 year project to upgrade our card payments platform. Almost all of these new deliverables are built on entirely new technology stacks and are designed to make it easier for our customers to leverage our open architecture tools and philosophy, to deliver cutting-edge solutions for their account holders.  As you may know, we have a number of active projects at Jack Henry centered on the topic of corporate responsibility. We continue to advance our environmental stewardship commitment and recently announced that on risk day, our associates launched a new business innovation group called Go Green.  Our business innovation groups, our Company-sponsored, associate-driven groups that provide a collaborative platform for people, ideas, and thoughts, to intersect, and help address business challenges.  Our associates decided that a business Innovation group focused on our planet was appropriate and necessary for us to make meaningful progress on this initiative. As the labor market continues to heat up, we're focused more than ever on attracting and retaining talented associates.  To that end, we have recently implemented new technology to expand our remote recruiting efforts and broaden our pool of qualified and diverse talent. Our hope is that this approach will only serve to improve on reputation as a great place to work, which we currently enjoy in cities across the country.  Our consistent placement on the Best Places to Work list is a testament to the workplace culture we have at Jack Henry. And our employee engagement scores reflect that strong culture. I'm pleased to share that nearly 2/3 of our associates participated in our most recent engagement survey and our average engagement score was 83%, well above the industry benchmark. Like most employers, we have spent a good bit of time in the past few weeks wrestling with decisions around the right timing and approach to move employees back to work in our Company facilities. We worked with our leadership teams earlier in the calendar year and determined that more than half of our workforce would continue to work remotely indefinitely. We had targeted July 1st as our return to office state for those who would be returning on a full-time or hybrid basis. But as the Delta variant surged, we reverted to our previous operating model with only essential employees in our offices every day.  We have proven that we can operate effectively in a remote posture and we will continue in that mode until we determine it is safe to make a change. As I referenced on the last earnings call, our long-time Chairman, Jack Prim, has retired as of the end of June. Jack had been with our Company for many years in various leadership roles and as a Board Member and Chairman. As a result of Jack's retirement, we have announced two changes to the board. Curtis Campbell has joined the Board effective July 1st to fill the seat left vacant by Jack's departure. Curtis is President of Software for Blucora in Dallas. He brings extensive experience in infrastructure and cloud computing, as well as digital development and a keen focus on customer experience. I'm very excited to see what new perspectives Curtis brings to our Board in discussions. Also effective July 1st, I was elected to be the new Board Chair. I was humbled and honored by the confidence expressed by the other board members, and I look forward to leading the Jack Henry Board to even greater success. As I reflect back on fiscal 2021, I can confidently say it was a very good year for our Company.  Our employee engagement scores remain very high and we've made great strides with our diversity and inclusion initiatives. Our levels of customer engagement and customer satisfaction scores are also very high. We have successfully completed several leadership and board-level retirements and replacements.  Our Sales teams are performing extremely well and have positioned us for another successful year of selling. Overall demand for Jack Henry Technology Solutions remains high in all segments of our business. We have a commitment to doing the right thing for our constituents that we believe will continue to serve us well. We will continue with our disciplined approach to running the Company. And expect that approach to help provide stability for our employees, customers, and shareholders. As we begin the new Fiscal year, I continue to be very optimistic about the future. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Dave. Our service and support revenue -- line of revenue increased 6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago. As Dave mentioned, our deconversion fees for the quarter were pretty flat with last year's fourth quarter.  However, for the full year, our deconversion fees were down 33.3 million for the full fiscal year compared to the prior year, which is actually the guidance that we provided a year ago on this call.  Our service for revenue primary driver was our data processing hosting fees and our private cloud and public cloud offerings, which continued to show strong growth in the quarter compared to the previous year, growing by 7% for the quarter.  However, the growth in this line is slowed significantly due to product delivery in service revenue, which includes deconversion fees, license, hardware, implementation, and convert merged revenue, which only grew 2% compared to the prior-year quarter, which this line is obviously somewhat impacted by COVID. Our processing revenue increased 15% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by our higher card volumes from new customers installed last year and increased debit card and credit card usage from existing customers.  Our Jack Henry digital revenue continues to grow -- show very strong growth as demand for our Banno digital platform continues to be very strong as Dave highlighted. Our total revenue was up 10% for the quarter compared to last year on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.  So excluding deconversion fees and divestitures, our non-GAAP grew 10% as well. For the full fiscal year, revenue was up 4% on a GAAP basis and 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Again, excluding deconversion fees and revenues from divestitures.  Our cost of revenue was up 8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The increase is primarily due to higher costs associated with our card processing and higher personnel costs compared to a year ago.  Our research and development expense decreased 4% for the quarter of fiscal '21 over the prior-year quarter. The decrease was due primarily to a slightly higher percentage of costs being capitalized for product development this quarter compared to a year ago.  Our SG&A expense increased 3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. The increase is due primarily to increased personnel and professional services costs.  Our reported consolidated operating margins increased nicely from 18.7 last year to 21.4 in the current year quarter. And on a non-GAAP basis, our operating margins expanded from 17.8% last year to 20.1% this year. Our Payments segment saw the nicest margin expansion in the quarter. After completing the payment platform migration in Q3, margins grew from 43% last year to 45% this year on a fourth-quarter on a GAAP basis, and on a non-GAAP basis, our Payments segment margins grew from 42.3 to 44.5.  So over 200 base margin expansion. Our core segment operating margin decreased slightly during the quarter compared to last year on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis. While our Company's segment margins increased slightly on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of Fiscal '21 was down slightly to 19.7%, compared to 20% in the same quarter year ago, primarily due to some tax -- state tax deductibility timing. Our net income grew 25% to 76.9 million for the fourth fiscal quarter, compared to 61.3 million last year with earnings per share of $1.04 for the current quarter, compared to $0.80 last year, or a $0.24 or 30% increase over the prior year.  Our cash flow total amortization increased 3% for the fiscal year compared to last year primarily due to capitalized projects being placed into service last year, including the total amortization as the amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to 17.7 million this fiscal year compared to 20.3 million last fiscal year.  Depreciation is up slightly at less than 1% for the year compared to the prior fiscal year. During the year, we purchased 2.8 million shares of our Jack Henry stock to the treasury for 431.5 million. And we paid dividends of 133.8 million for a total return to shareholders of 565.3 million for the year.  Our operating cash flow was 462.1 million for the year, which is down from 510.5 million last fiscal year, which is this decrease was primarily due to the timing of various operating assets and liabilities and timing. We invested 157.8 million back into our Company through Capex and capitalized software. Our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less Capex, less cap software, and adding magnetic proceeds from the disposal of assets, was 310.5 million for the year, which represents a 99.7% net income to free cash flow conversion.  Yesterday's press release inadvertently omitted the proceeds from dispositions line of net cash from investing activities within the cash flow summary, a mass that should've been included were cash inflows 60 -- 6.187 million in fiscal '21 and 11,130 million per fiscal 2020. The totals for investing activities were correct.  This will mission was corrected in the version of the earnings press release filed yesterday on Form 8-K, and the one located on our website. A couple of comments on our balance sheet, a cash position of 51 million compared to 213 million a year ago, primarily down due to the significant stock repurchase we did.  You remember at the end of Q3, we had 200 million draws down on a revolver. During Q4, we paid down 100 million of that balance. So at 06/30, we had $100 million on a revolver. We had no other long-term Debt on our Balance sheet other than operating leases. For the year, our return on average assets for the fiscal year was 13.1%. Our return on invested capital for the fiscal year was 21%. And our return on equity for the year was 21.7%. Yesterday, we provided both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance in the press release for fiscal 2022.  We also provided a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance in the release following the segment information in the press release. Just to be clear, this guidance continues to assume that the country continues to open and the economy continues to improve, but if things were to go differently than this, then guidance will be revised.  For GAAP revenue growth for fiscal '22, based on the amounts that were released yesterday, our revenue guidance is a range of 8.2% to 8.7% growth over Fiscal '21 due to higher anticipated deconversion fees compared to FY '21. And for non-GAAP revenue growth, we're guiding to an initial range of 7.5 to 8% growth for the fiscal year. Obviously, these will be updated during the year on future earnings calls. We do anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins to improve a little in FY '22 compared to last year as we should have nice margins expansion in our payments segment and anticipate higher deconversion fees.  I am somewhat cautious on guiding to too much of the improvement in operating margin, as we will continue to have headwinds on the license revenue. As we continue to move core customers from on-prem to our private cloud. Also, travel costs continued to increase significantly compared to the last year. And at this time, we are still planning to host our Jack Henry Annual Conference and our Symitar Edu Conference in person this year. Thereafter, there will be some large cost returning this year compared to last year when there was very little travel.  However, we do think that we will get at least 50 BPS of margin expansion in the fiscal year. Our effective tax rate for FY '22 is projected to be slightly higher at approximately 22.5% to 23% compared to our actual rate this year of 21.7.  And this is primarily due to the significant impact from equity awards that were deductible in FY '21. Our initial FY '22 GAAP EPS guidance is a range of 453 to 460, which is a 10% plus increase in our FY '21 finish. This concludes our opening comments. We're now ready to take questions. Liz (ph), will you please open the lines up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vasu Govil with KBW. Vasu Govil : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And I wanted to congratulate David on becoming Chairman of the Board. David Foss : Thank you, Vasu. Vasu Govil : I guess, just the first question to follow up on the margin commentary there that you have provided, Kevin. I know that previously you had indicated about 100 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal '22 and potentially even some upside to that. Now, you seem to be indicating 50 basis points. So I guess, just wanted to understand what changed in your outlook versus what you were expecting before? Kevin Williams : Well, I will tell you that the biggest change is the impact of COVID because, obviously, we had some really nice margin expansion this year with no travel-related costs. Obviously, there was also a decrease in revenue from converted merge revenue and other things. So there's a lot of offsetting things out there. And just to be clear, I feel like both our revenue GAAP or non-GAAP revenue grows from 7.5% to 8%. And our margin expansion of 50 bits is both conservatives. Vasu Govil : Got it. Understood. And I guess the second question I had, I was just hoping if you could provide some color on growth expectations by segment for fiscal '22, particularly what you're expecting for the core and payments segment. I know with the core segment, do you expect sort of this improvement that we've seen on a non-GAAP basis to kind of continue into next year and then payment segment everybody been quite strong and then is there room for further acceleration as some of the new wins on the card payments side start to flow in? Kevin Williams : Yeah. So I mean, we saw some really nice margin expansion in the payments segment in Q4, we will see more in FY '22. There are still additional costs that will be coming out by the end of the first half of Fiscal '22 in the payments segment.  So I think there will still be some really nice margin expansion. And as we added additional customers, that will also expand the margins. And obviously, cards are still 60% of the payments segment. Vasu Govil : Thank you very much. Kevin Williams : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Peter Heckmann : Good morning, everyone. David Foss : Good morning, Pete. Peter Heckmann : In terms of thinking about the record sales in the fourth quarter, is there a way of thinking about total bookings on like TCV or ACV basis? In terms of thinking about a year-over-year increase, I think in the prior year you had 43 competitive core takeaways.  Of course, not all financial institutions are equal. They're quite variant in sizes. But given some of the difficulties over the last fiscal year, either way, thinking about the kind of percentage increase in overall bookings that might help us think about the outlook? David Foss : Yeah. When you have a sales sense, Dave, by the way, Pete, when you have a sales organization or a sales quota, the size of our sales quota, a percentage increase of more than 5% per year is a very significant increase.  And if I remember correctly, I don't think I have it exactly in front of me, but I think it was year-over-year. It was about 7% or 8%, somewhere in that range, year-over-year as far as sales bookings.  Now, we know -- you know this well, we don't publish TCV numbers or anything like that, but it's -- that's a good way to think about how we measure quota and how quotas are assigned. So you can kind of use that logic in making some assumptions. So if we're 7% or 8% ish increase over the prior year as far as sales performance, that's a good way to think about it.  Now the other thing I'll point out is when we assign quotas for the next year, meaning for the year we are in now, fiscal '22, we -- our starting point is last year's performance, and then we normally apply somewhere between 3% and 5% quota increase over the top of what the performance was last year.  So that's where the sales team is starting out this year is with a sales quota that is somewhere in the 3% to 5% range larger than it was their actual attainment for the prior year. Peter Heckmann : Got it. That is helpful. And then just thinking about the cadence of term fees, the guide for term fees, and the surprise with some of the uptick we've seen in M&A in the mid-tier space. But in terms of the cadence, Kevin, would you specifically call out some level for the first quarter or when you might think those might hit just in terms of trying to get the quarterly forecast correct? Kevin Williams : Well, I mean, Peter, obviously, we've been hearing a lot about M&A activity, which obviously that's what drives deconversion fees is. But we have not seen a lot of actual activity yet so I think that's going to grow over the year. So I have a feeling that the bulk of the deconversion fees are probably going to be in the second half of the year. Peter Heckmann : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Dave Koning : Hey, guys. Thank you and nice job. And I guess my first question, just when we think of kind of the wallet providers, that space, there are a lot of investors that are just concerned that that group is just going to take over the world and all bank accounts will kind of move to that over time. But I guess a couple of things, am you seeing growth in your number of accounts?  I don't know if you have some metrics on that, your total accounts. But also, is there any reason that the banks can't do exactly the same thing and provide all the same services, plus have FDIC insurance and all those things that make most consumers rather just have a bank account over time? David Foss : That's a very intuitive question, Dave. In fact, I'm presenting at a conference in, I think it's February of next year, on that very topic, because bankers are starting to realize that, that if you have a good digital platform on the front end, and if you take advantage of open infrastructure like we have at Jack Henry and it's the reason we talk about it all the time, you can do as a banker, essentially all those same things and draw customers to your platform as a bank with the FDIC insurance backing it, and there's a real opportunity for bankers to take advantage of this desire and demand among consumers today for solutions like that. So we're doing that today with a number of banks, but part of that channel -- part of the process for me is to educate bankers on what they can do, what they should be thinking about, how they compete in those areas.  So lots of opportunities for our customers and for Jack Henry, but it are based on a really outstanding digital platform. And then having all the connectivity to connect those types of Fintech functions into that digital platform.  And we have all those things in production today at Jack Henry. This isn't a wish for the future, this is in production today with customers today, so great opportunity. And so the first part of your question about customer growth, so yes, we are able to measure customer growth, whether it's members on the credit union platform or customers on the banking platforms.  And not only are we adding customers because we're winning share, we're winning new customers, so the net number of customers we serve is greater, but because there is same-store sales growth happening, particularly on the credit inside of the business, It's happening on the banking side, but it's been strong on the crediting side of the business as well. Dave Koning : Okay. Great. Thanks. That's good to hear. And then maybe secondly, growth in payments, obviously, really good. I assume that debit transaction growth is just off of a pretty low base. But how do we -- how do you expect that to grow through the year?  I would think Q1 would still be pretty high off kind of easier comps in then maybe the rest of the year, a little below double-digits or something, like, do you have any sort of cadence for that? David Foss : I think that's a good expectation. The other thing I'll highlight is, we talk and Kevin emphasizes that 60% of our payments business is on the cards platform, but don't forget about the business we refer to as EPS, enterprise payment solutions. That's our merchant cat -- our remote capture and mobile capture business. That business has been growing nicely as well. So it's a much smaller piece of the segment, but it's growing rapidly.  And I think you're going to continue to hear more about that business at Jack Henry as well. So both of those two. And I've said it on many earnings calls, the bill pay business, relatively flat for everybody.  There's not a whole lot of new stuff happening in traditional bill pay. The card growth that you've seen, I think under or in the high single-digits is a good expectation for the card growth. But it will be greater than that for the EPS business as far as what we're seeing right now because of the strength of that platform. Kevin Williams : And Dave, remember it's not just debt. We now offer full-service credit as well because we could not offer that before we got moved over to the new platform. So our full-service credit is growing, basically, from a base of 0. Dave Koning : Yeah. Gotcha. Thanks, guys. Nice job. Kevin Williams : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Hey. Good morning. Kevin, I just wanted to ask a little bit about the credit card platform conversion. Looks like that's going well. And you talked about a little bit more a cost coming out of the payments business.  I'm wondering in relation to what you anticipated for cost savings out of that platform, would you have achieved that or exceeded that? How would you characterize the cost savings from your platform? Kevin Williams : Okay. So, Kartik, we completed the migration in Q3. Kartik Mehta : Right. Kevin Williams : So we had all customers on the new platform and in -- sometime in April, we started decommissioning the four mainframes that supported the 2 platforms that we used to have. And I think those got completely decommissioned, I believe, by mid-July, if I remember right. But there are some other things that are going on here, Kartik. So there were some other tools that we have to keep the talent on to rewrite and get some additional tools in place, which will be done by the end of Q2. And so you'll see some additional costs coming out by then. So by Q3 of this year, we will see the full benefit of the cost takeout that we guided to 3 years ago. Kartik Mehta : Perfect. And Dave, I think you've talked about maybe core demand now increasing as people realize that COVID is still going on and some of the decisions they didn't make, they're making. How would you characterize core demand today? Is it increasing or is it back to normal? David Foss : I would say that it's back to normal. So normal for Jack Henry. So pre-pandemic, we were running at about one new competitive replacement per week. We're back to that level now. We did 15 last quarter, we did 13 this quarter.  Everything that I'm seeing now would indicate that that's a pace that we can run at for a while. It's definitely leading the industry by far as new quarter replacements. And that's -- that looks sustainable for us now. Kartik Mehta : And just one last question there. Have you seen any change in the competitive nature for these core renewals, maybe as the market gets back to a little bit normal? David Foss : For core renewals, what -- we've talked about this in the past. Consultants are now engaged every time there's a renewal. So 10 years ago, it was rare to have a consultant involved in the renewals. Today, every single one of them has a consultant and that's not just Jack Henry, it's in the industry. And how does the consultant justify their role?  It's by ensuring that it's a very competitive process. So that's been going on. It started before the pandemic. It is definitely in place today, where every single renewal for all of us, there is a consultant engaged. They are encouraging diligent review of pricing and all that kind of stuff. And so we know how to operate in that model and we're comfortable with what's happening. Kartik Mehta : Perfect. Thanks, Dave. I appreciate it. David Foss : [Indiscernible]. Operator : Our next question comes from John Davis with Raymond James. John Davis :  Hey. Good morning, guys. Kevin, just a quick clarification around the margin. So you said 50 basis points. Just want to clarify, that's on a non-GAAP basis of expansion. And then to the follow-up there.  I think our math suggests that the payments cut for migration would be about a 50 basis point benefit this year. So the right way to think about it, that incremental travel and other expenses kind of offset normal operating leverage with maybe a little bit of upside during the conservative comments. Kevin Williams : And then, John, I saw you -- I saw in your note about the EPS and your calculation on margins. You also remember that our effective tax rate is going to go up from 21.7 to 22.5 to 23% too, so if you're just looking at EPS, that's also going to have a slightly negative impact, but we're still guiding EPS to grow more than 10%. John Davis :  Okay. And then you guys are guiding deconversion fees up about 70% year-over-year. Is that the right way to think about the increase in conversion merger revenue? And then, anyway, you guys can give us an idea of what percentage of a normal year convert reg -- convert merge revenue is a percentage of your core segment revenue?  Just trying to understand because I think that was one of the areas that were a little bit weaker than you expected this year. And just how we should think about that bounce back coming in '22. Kevin Williams : Yeah. There was a significant headwind from convert merge revenue being down because there's no M&A activity, and you're absolutely right. I mean, if deconversion revenue does take up as we think, our customers will be buying just as much as our customers are getting acquired. So not only would it increase convert merge revenue, but also it'll increase billed travel because we'll have more people traveling out to do that convert merges. As a percentage of total revenue, on top of my head, John, I can't -- I mean, it's not a huge number.  But when you start talking several million dollars in convert merge revenue that we'd beat missing bills full boat for those. So it's a very nice margin business, a price of them. It's actually the highest implementation margins we have. So not only does it help or reduce the headwinds on revenue, but also, it helps our overall operating margin. David Foss : And I will chime in here, Dom on that topic. We -- one of the things that are interesting in this business is when a -- an existing customer is looking at acquiring another institution, whether it's a bank or credit union, we have a lot of visibility into that because they will contact us to say, we're working on this deal.  We may not consummate the deal that we're working on it, we want to make sure that we have a conversion slot available. We have time on the Jack Henry calendar because we want to be able to do that as quickly after we close the deal as possible. So we have good visibility -- a good deal of visibility into the activity that's happening out there in the convert merger space. And I can tell you right now there is a lot of activity. So there's a lot in the press about M&A activity coming back.  And we're certainly seeing it in the number of our customers who are coming to us saying, we're looking at acquiring another institution, we want to make sure you guys are ready to help us. So we can't exactly predict when those things are going to happen, but the activity levels are definitely back. John Davis :  Okay. And then last one for me. Kevin, anything to call out from sequential cadence this year on the revenue side? Where margins are? Should we just basically look at 2 years to your CAGRs on the top line? And maybe remind us when your in-person conferences are in those expenses and which quarters those will be in. Thanks, guys. Kevin Williams : Yeah. So, John, it's a good question. And actually, I thought about that as I was driving over here for this meeting this morning. Cadance said -- the one thing I'd say is, we've now been on ASC 606 now for 4 years. So the cadence of growth is going to come to the same.  Q1 should be really strong because of all the software subscription revenue that we take, the first -- that quarter. It obviously gets a little weaker in Q2 and then just grows in Q3 and Q4 from there. And as far as our user conference, or actually a combined conference this year, well, they're not really combined, they kind of an overlap, and those are scheduled to be in October. So that'll hit Q2. John Davis :  Okay. I appreciate you, guys. Thanks. Kevin Williams : Yeah. Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. The sales pipeline is just so much better, 7% to 8% versus your quarter -- your quota, rather, of typically a raise of 3% to 5%. Maybe we could talk about what's filling that gap. Is it a few large clients that you won that have kind of raised that?  Or is it perhaps some pent-up demand that's coming in recently that was lagging previously? Maybe you could walk us through the puts and takes of why you're -- is it just pure execution? Anything you could provide there. I'd really appreciate it. Thanks so much. David Foss : Sure. And just to be clear, Dominick, so when I was referring to the 7% to 8%, I was talking about actual performance over the prior year. So pipeline, just so we're all clear on terminology when I talk pipeline, I'm talking about the opportunities that we're working currently that may close in the future, as opposed to quota attainment as things that have been booked in the past and are deals that have already been signed with our customers.  But to answer the specifics of your question, no, this is not just a few large clients or something like that. This is a broad suite of solutions that we've been selling to a broad list of customers. Of course, the core success that we've had this year was significant, and so that's a driver.  I highlighted in my opening comments the number of Banno customers that we signed this year, so 219 brand new Banno digital customers. That is becoming an important driver for us as we go forward. But then it's all of these other solutions. So treasury management and all the customers that we signed for our payments platforms, including like I mentioned in my response to Dave Koning's question earlier, our EPS platform, which we're seeing some nice interest in that as a payments platform for our customers going forward.  So it's just a broad variety of solutions to the point about pent-up demand and that's a little bit of a tough one because we saw -- sales were lumpier during the height of COVID, but we didn't see -- when you look at it over the 12-month period, we didn't see sales slowed down, but it was very lumpy.  So I have trouble characterizing it as pent-up demand because the sales happen, they were just not quite as smooth or normally accustomed to. So I think it's interesting, Jack Henry, its customers coming to Jack Henry who just hasn't done business with us before.  And it's because of this broad suite of solutions that we have and all of the new technology we deliver. So I highlighted it in my opening comments. The work that our Symitar team did around database migration, and delivering an entirely new database.  The lending team with all the new functionality that we've delivered there this year, the digital team, which I've already highlighted, the payments ' PayCenter platform that I talked about in my opening comments, where we now enable all these real-time payments through our brand new, ground-up payments platform. So it's a variety of different things that you add them all together and it was just a really successful sales year. Dominick Gabriele : It is definitely no question arguing with the awesome sales wins numbers. And then maybe just one more. When you talk about the revenue and margin guidance being conservative, can you maybe walk through some of the puts and takes of that commentary? And you went over this a little bit. But when you think about beating the 50 basis points margin expansion, does that really coincide with you beating your revenue guidance? And perhaps what kind of investments do you think you could look -- you could see where, even if you beat on the revenue guidance, there are some additional investments you'd like to make that might just keep you around that 50 basis points overall for margin expansion for the year? Thank you. Kevin Williams : That's a good question. So to beat the guidance we gave for non-GAAP revenue, it would mean that we would have some continued implementation of movements from some of our card customers. So move some large debit customers over the continued success in our credit card platform processing MA activity, which would drive the convert merge revenue and billable travel that we talked about earlier. And then just meeting and then obviously the continued movement of moving out in -- on-prem customers into our private cloud also help our margins. So there are several different drivers that could cause us to beat that non - GAAP revenue guidance. And from what I'm seeing, I think that's probably going to happen. But I'm not willing to step on that limb and say how much this point. And every one of those things I just mentioned can also help to improve margin. As far as investments, I mean, we just finished our budget and I don't know that even if we beat revenue guidance, I don't know that there are any big investments out there that we need to make, that we're not already making, either from a cap software development or from Capex that's not already in the budget, which is part of that guidance. Dominick Gabriele : Really great. Thanks so much for taking on my questions. Kevin Williams : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. Ken Suchoski : Hi, good morning, David and Kevin. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask about Banno since you had some really strong results there. I believe Banno is no longer restricted to the core basis year. So I was hoping you could talk about how you expect Banno growth to trend now that that offering is open to the rest of the market. And what's the size of that business today? You mentioned I think it's 5.6 million users. I mean, what type of revenue does Banno contribute? David Foss : So first off, just to be clear, Ken, what I've said is that we'll start selling Banno outside the base in calendar 2022. So it's not this calendar year, it will be next year. This year is the major deliverable for the Banno group is Banno business, which is the -- you think about all the functionality we have on the consumer side with Banno, in a couple of months here, we'll deliver all that same type of functionality on the business side of the solution. And then it'll be next calendar year that we'll start delivering outside the base. But as I've stressed on these calls in the past, most banks and credit unions in the U.S. -- I'm not just talking about Jack Henry core customers, I'm talking in general.  Most of them have an Internet banking offering and a mobile banking offering and they are 2 different things, 2 different experiences. Consumers don't want 2 different experiences anymore. They expect to have a single experience when they go to access their information from their financial institution.  And it doesn't matter what the form factor is. If they're on a phone, on a tablet, on a PC, they expect to have the same experience. And so that creates an opportunity for us, both inside and outside our base. And so that's not changing anytime soon. There are thousands of institutions out there who will, over the next several years, upgrade their digital experience, and we plan to be there with Banno outside the base next year. As far as the size of the business, we don't call that out as a separate business. We have discussed at some point, we would possibly do that as a segment, but we're not there yet. But it's -- the 5.6 million users, I've been asked on these calls before.  There are some pure players -- pure-play offerings out there that you can kind of do the math and figure out based on their number of users with the revenue per user is. Is that transferable to Jack Henry? And my answer is generally, yes, that's transferable, so you can kind of figure out how large the business is.  The thing that I will stress is for that business. Our digital business operates under the same rules as our other businesses at Jack Henry, which means you don't get a pass on making money. You have to produce operating income, operating results in addition to revenue growth. And certainly, the Banno business is doing that for Jack Henry. So it's continuing to grow nicely, will continue to grow nicely based on all the things we're seeing right now, the backlog of installs that we have right now. And will continue to produce operating -- bottom-line operating results for our Company. Kevin Williams : Just one more thing in there. So when we talk about digital, that's not just Banno that includes a lot of different things, which includes our predecessor NetTeller solution, which we still have several hundred FIs on our NetTeller solution and using our goDough mobile solution.  And a lot of those will never move to Banno. But when we talk about digital, we're talking about all of that [Indiscernible], and Geezeo, and Molson, which is open anywhere, which is some of the acquisitions we've done the last 3 years. So the term digital encompasses quite a few different products and offerings. Ken Suchoski : Yeah. That's really helpful. The very detailed answer there. Appreciate that. And I know you guys aren't giving guidance for fiscal year '23, but there's a lot of moving parts at the margin in terms of things opening up, you have the platform migration.  But once that platform migration, I guess, is behind you, what's the right way to think about margin s or margin expansion after fiscal year '22. Just because when I look at your numbers, I mean, Jack Henry had a, call it a roughly, 24.5% operating margin in fiscal year '17. I mean, is that a good benchmark for fiscal year '23? Kevin Williams : Well, it depends on which numbers you're looking at for 2017. If you're looking for the restated numbers after ASC 606 or if you're looking at the previous numbers because ASC 606 did have an impact on our margins.  But I would say -- I'd answer it this way. I'm pretty comfortable that after we get through FY 22, again, there are a lot of unknowns out there with COVID and all of the things. But I think starting FY 23, we can kind of go back to our normal 50 to a 100 basis points expansion in our operating margin as we get everything kind of put back in place this year. Ken Suchoski : That's really helpful. And then maybe my last question just -- I guess, as you think about new sales and how they're expected to trend as the economy reopens, the pipeline's quite strong. Just curious if you expect that to accelerate as you get back to see your customers in person. David Foss : Yeah. I don't expect that you're going to see some great big pop in sales. I mean, as I said before, our quota is a very large number today. And so if you're growing it 3% to 5% year-over-year on a very large sales number, that sets the Company up pretty well because we're such a high concentration of recurring revenue.  So you assume that the recurring revenue is continuing to percolate and you're layering revenue in on top of it, and you're growing a sales quarter at 3% to 5% per year over the prior-year performance. That's a pretty solid model so I'm happy with that model. Don't expect that we're going to see some great big pop in sales in the coming year. I think the performance will continue to be solid and consistent. Ken Suchoski : Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks a lot, David and Kevin, really appreciate it. Kevin Williams : Good. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Dan Perlin : Yes. Good morning. It's [Indiscernible] for Dan. Just a quick question. With the payment platform conversion done, are there any remaining major solutions that need to be kind of re-plat formed onto the open architecture?  And then with theoretical solutions on an open architecture. Does that change the sort of accounting cadence between capitalization of software, timing, or D&A, or are the income statement components of CapEx? David Foss : So I'll take the first part of your question and Kevin can address any of the hard financial questions, the CFO stuff. So first up, we have about 300 different solutions. And so they are all in some stage of either full platform on a completely open platform, or they're in the process or some has done.  And there are some that it isn't logical to take them to an open -- to a new architecture. We, for example, have a payroll solution that it's been around for a long time. It was a successful product. Nobody is buying payroll solutions from a provider like us anymore.  We haven't sold a copy in 20 years. Why would we put the effort into re-platforming that product? So if you look at the broad suite of solutions that we offer, it isn't logical to try and move everything to a new platform.  But for all those that are -- the real high demand solutions, maybe either have been put into a completely open environment or they're in process of offering that type of solution. And many have been imported to public cloud offerings. So we're both in Azure and AWS today with some of our solutions. We have many in our private cloud. So it's just -- because of the broad suite of products that we have, it's just kind of naturally a variety of different platforms that we offer them on. But for the kind of the key solutions that either is today supporting open connectivity, open infrastructure, or we're well on our way to doing that. And then I'll let you take the hard part, Kevin. Kevin Williams : So the other part, Dan, is if you look at us for, let's say the last 10 plus years, and I actually have a chart that shows this, our total R&D spend for R&D expense on the P&L and cap software on the cash-flow statement has been 14% of revenue.  So our total R&D spends has grown at almost the exact same pace as our top-line revenue for the last 10 years. I don't see that changing. I think we're not changing that. And I would tell you that the way that -- we don't do really big bang productions.  I mean, we do sprints and do try to get modules rolled out as quickly as possible and do additional modules. So there's no -- you're not going to see a huge increase in amortization of software in any given year. It's just kind of become slowly grow.  Because at any given time -- there's actually a chart I show the Board every quarter. At any given time, about 85% or 86% of our total cap software on the balance sheet is in production being amortized. And that hasn't changed for the last couple -- the last few years either. So what that tells you, as we're continuing to develop all that software, we continue to roll it out.  But at the same time in 5 years, some of the stuff, the amortizations were done amortizing. So you've got an offset there. So I don't think that we're going to do anything crazy in the foreseeable future. It's going to have much of an impact on either cash flow or the P&L other than what you've seen in the last few years. Dan Perlin : Okay. Thank you very much. Kevin Williams : You bet. Operator : That concludes today's question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Kevin Williams for closing remarks. Kevin Williams : Thank you. And thank you all again for joining us. We continue to be very pleased with the overall results of our ongoing operations. I do want to thank all of our associates for the way they've handled these challenges by taking care of themselves and our customers and continuing to work hard to improve our Company to continue moving forward for the future.  All of us at Jack Henry continue to focus on what is best for our customers and our shareholders. Thank you again for joining us. And Liz (ph), would you please provide the replay number so it's in the transcript? Operator : The replay of this call will be available until 11 :59 PM Eastern Time, August 25th, 2021.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Insructions]. And please be advised today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I will know like to hand the conference over to your first speaker for today. Hey, Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer. You may begin, sir. A - Kevin Williams : Thanks, Brian. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Jack Henry & Associates first quarter of fiscal 2022 earnings call. I am Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasure. And on the call today is David Foss, Board Chair, President, and CEO of Jack Henry. And just then I will turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about [Indiscernible] business, financial sales performance for the quarter, comments regarding the industry in general, and some other key initiatives that we have in place. Then after Dave concludes his comments, I will provide some additional foster comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market closed and also provide some comments regarding our updating guidance for our fiscal year 2022, provided in the release yesterday.  And then we will open the lines up for Q&A. First, I need to remind you that this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends, or results. Like [Indiscernible] about future, these are subject to a number of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements, for a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled risk factors and forward-looking statements.  On this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found in yesterday's press release. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave. A - David Foss : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our first fiscal quarter, particularly in light of the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. We continue to operate with well over 90% of our employees working full-time remote and continue to evaluate options regarding an appropriate return to office target for all affected employees. With that, let's shift our focus to look at our SEP performance for the quarter we completed in September. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, total revenue increased 8% for the quarter and increased 9% on a non-GAAP basis.  Deconversion fees were down more than $2 million over the prior year quarter. Turning to the segments, we had another solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 8% for the quarter and increased by 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Our Payments segment again performed well and also posted an 8% increase in revenue this quarter, and a 9% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had another strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses with a 9% increase in revenue this quarter and a 9% increase on a non-GAAP basis. Traditionally our first quarter has been our lightest sales bookings quarter because our fourth quarter tends to be extremely strong and the sales pipeline is depleted as a result, As you may recall, the June quarter was the strongest sales quarter in the history of the Company, so we certainly expected this historical trend to hold through.  What we experienced, however, was just the opposite, the performance of the sales organization was again, very strong with a number of notable wins. In the quarter, we booked 6 competitive core takeaways and 10 deals to move existing in-house customers to our private cloud environment. Although our rate of 6 takeaways is light as compared to our normal run rate, it is clear to me that a number of deals fell into the month of October because we booked 6 more core takeaways in October alone. As we've discussed on prior calls, our convert merge backlog is a good indicator for us of what to expect with coming mergers and acquisitions within our base of customers.  We can now see that M&A in the banking space will be very active this year because almost all of our conversion slots for acquired banks are full for the year. We are working to evaluate whether or not we need to add more conversion teams to keep up with the activity. You should expect to see a corresponding increase in deconversion revenue, as some of our institutions are acquired by others in the space. Kevin will provide more detail on this line when he shares his comments. We continue to see good success with our new card processing solution, signing 6 new debit processing clients this quarter and one new credit client. We also continue to see great success signing clients to our Banno digital suite with 35 new contracts in Q1.  Speaking of our digital suite, we're continuing to implement new financial institution clients on the Banno platform at a similar pace to recent quarters. At the end of Q1, we surpassed 6 million registered users on the platform and that number is growing at about 125,000 users per month. At the same time, our Banno platform continues to hold one of the highest consumer ratings in the App Store. The band or digital suite, as well down the path to becoming the industry-leading digital banking solution. The continued success we've seen with sales and adoption of our digital suite is consistent with the expectations coming out of the bank director technology survey published in August.  As they do every year, bank directors surveyed hundreds of their subscribers during June and July regarding a variety of technology prioritization and spending topics. More than 50% of the responses they received were from bank CEOs and our board members, with almost 80% of the responded bank greater than $500 million in assets. This year survey showed an interesting shift as more than 70% of the responding banks had moved efficiency of operation to the top of their priority list, and improved customer experience and an improved digital experience followed closely behind. To further the point regarding an improved digital experience, this year, 54% of the respondents indicated that their customers prefer to interact with their bank using a digital channel rather than in-branch or over the phone. The survey also indicated that the median increase in expected technology spending for the coming year, was 10% as compared to the prior year. All of this boards well for the future of our digital suite, as well as the other solutions offered by Jack Henry, which helped facilitate an improved customer experience and an opportunity to enhance efficiency in the financial institution. As many of you know, we normally conduct our 2 largest client conferences in the fall each year.  This year, we combine those conferences into 1 event and again, hosted the sessions virtually. We had hoped to be in person this year, but because of the size of the event, we decided that wasn't prudent. As we saw last year, attendance was much larger than our in-person conferences because nobody had to incur any travel expense and they were able to readily drop into virtual sessions. We were pleased to be able to successfully interact in a virtual setting with many of our existing clients and prospects. Last week, we announced 2 pending retirements from our leadership team. Our long time CFO and Treasurer, Kevin Williams, and our CTO, Ted Bulky, have both announced their intent to retire next summer. As we shared in the press release, we already have a search in process to find Kevin's replacement and will be considering both internal and external candidates. Kevin will be with us until we identify the right person and have them fully prepared to take the reigns. Ted will transition out of his role in January when Ben Mats, our current Head of Digital Solutions, will become our Chief Digital and Technology Officer. Ted will stay for several months after that to help Ben with the transition. Of course, we have many months before each of them actually retire. So I have lots of time to thank them for their many years of service to our associates, customers, and shareholders.  But I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge how much I've enjoyed working with each of them and how much I appreciate the approach each of them has taken to executing these much deserved retirements. Next week, we will conduct our annual shareholder meeting. We will be hosting this meeting in person in [Indiscernible], but we'll abide by strict COVID protocols to ensure a safe event for all attendees. We are excited to be able to meet with our shareholders in-person again, who were also very aware of the ongoing pandemic-related concerns that arise when you assemble a group of people. We will start an hour earlier than in past years, we'll require all our attendees to be masked and we won't be serving a lunch following the meeting. With these changes, I'm confident we will have a productive and safe meeting.  In our ongoing attempt to communicate effectively regarding our ESG related efforts efforts, we recently published our ESG statement, which provides us a saint and centralized overview of Jack Henry's ESG commitments and material, environmental and social topics. Additionally, at points readers toward other-related policies, like our human rights policy. We've also published an environmental policy that highlights our commitment to sustainability and proper environmental management practices. Both documents can be found on our new corporate responsibility website via Investor Relations.  We created this website to house our sustainability reports and provide a centralized location for Jack Henry's ESG information. Speaking of sustainability reports, our next sustainability report covering calendar year 2021, will be published in March. We have continued to make major advances across our environmental, social, and governance initiatives, and the board has established a quarterly cadence to discuss ESG matters.  As we move forward forward, I'm very optimistic regarding our levels of sales activity and customer responses to solutions we're delivering and the strategies we are executing. We will continue with our disciplined approach to running the Company and we expect that approach to continue to provide stability and solid performance for our employees, customers, and shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. A - Kevin Williams : Thanks Dave. Service and support revenue increased 6% in the first quarter of FY 22, compared to same quarter a year ago. As Dave mentioned, our deconversion fees were actually down $2 million compared to last year, or 37% for the quarter. License revenue was down slightly compared to the prior year. And our hardware revenue was down $4 million or 39% compared to Q1 a year ago. This due to our customers continue to choose our private cloud delivery and therefore not purchasing hardware. Services port line of revenue, primary revenue drivers were our software subscription revenue and our data processing hosting fees and our private and public cloud offerings, which combined, continued to show strong growth in the quarter compared to the previous year, growing combined by 10% for the quarter.  However, the growth in this line was slowed significantly due to the product builder in services revenue, which includes the previously mentioned deconversion fees, license, and hardware along [Indiscernible] and convert merged revenue, which combined were down by a total of 9% compared to the prior-year quarter. Therefore, total support and services net grew 6% for the quarter. Our processing revenue increased 12% in the first quarter FY 22, compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. This increase was primarily driven by higher card volumes with new customers and sold last year and increased debit card usage from existing customers.  Our Jack Henry digital revenue continues to show strong growth as demand for our Banno digital platform continues to be very strong. As Dave mentioned, total revenues at 8% for the quarter compared to last year on a GAAP basis, and 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Our cost of revenue was up 5% compared to last year's first quarter. The increase is primarily due to higher costs associated with customer maintenance, card and transaction processing, along with higher personnel costs compared to a year ago. Research development expense increased 3% for the quarter FY22 compared to last year.  This increase is primarily due to personnel costs. And our SG and expense increased 13% in first quarter compared to the same quarter in previous year. And this increase was due primarily to increased personnel costs and travel-related costs compared to last year as travel increase significantly in Q1 compared to last year. Our reported consolidated operating margins increased from 26% last year to 27.4% in the current year, or 140 bp increase. And on a non-GAAP basis, operating margin expanded from 25.2% last year to 26.9% this year for 170 basis expansion. We had margin expansion in all 3 of our reporting operating segments on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.  The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal '22 increased to 23.4% compared to 22.4% in the same quarter a year ago, which is in line with guidance we provided on the previous call. Our net Income grew 12% to 102.1 million for the first fiscal quarter compared to 91.2 million last year with earnings per share of $1.38 for the quarter compared to $1.19 last year for $0.19 or 16% increase year-over-year. For cash flow, our total amortization increased 2% in the quarter compared to last year due to capitalized software projects being placed into service. Included in total amortization is amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions which decreased to $4.3 million this year compared to $4.4 million last year's quarter.  Our depression was down 2% compared to the prior fiscal year and during the quarter we paid dividends of $34 million. Our operating cash flow was $106.5 million for the year, which is down from $114.5 million last year, with the decrease primarily due to the timing and change of various operating assets of liabilities in the calculation of operating cash flow. We invested $46.5 million back into our companies capex and capitalized software. Our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capex and cap software and adding back net proceeds from disposed assets was $60.1 million for the quarter.  Our cash position at September 30th was $44.3 million compared to a $195.3 million a year ago, primarily due to the significant stock repurchases we did last year with $65 million drawn on our revolver has done in the quarter and we had no other long-term debt on our balance sheet or lasers. Return on our average assets for trailing 12 months is 13.7%. Return on invested capital for the trailing 12 months is 21.5% and return on equity for the trailing 12 months was 21.9%, which are all very strong. For FY22 guidance, we provided both GAAP and non-GAAP updated revenue guidance in the press release yesterday for fiscal '22. We also provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP revenue in the release immediately following the segment information in the release yesterday.  However, just to be clear, this guidance continues to assume that the country continues to open and the economy continues to improve, and if things were to go differently, obviously this guidance will be revised. For GAAP revenue growth for fiscal '22 based on the amounts in the release yesterday, our revenue guidance has range of 8.6% to 9.1%, approximately over previous year. We now anticipate deconversion revenue to be approximately $42 million to $43 million for the entire fiscal year, with significant percentage of that being in Q2 and Q3. For non-GAAP revenue growth, we continue to guide to a range of 7.5 to 8% growth for fiscal year.  Obviously, these will be updated during the year. We continue to anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins to improve in FY 22 compared to last year, as we should have very nice margin expansion in our payments segment, and anticipated higher deconversion fees. However, I continue to be somewhat cautious on guiding to too much of an operating margin expansion. As we will continue to have headwinds on license and hardware revenue as we continue to move core customers from on-premise to our private cloud and also travel costs will continue to increase significantly compared to the prior year. Our effective tax rate RevPAR 22 continues to be projected slightly higher at approximately 23% compared to the prior year. Obviously significant changes in corporate tax structure could change this guidance. And our FY 22 GAAP EPS guidance is range of $4.064 to $4.073, which is an increase from the prior guidance of $4.053 to $4.060. This concludes our opening comments, we're now ready to take questions, Brian, we please open the call lines up for questions. Operator : Our first questions come from Vasu Govil with KBW. Vasu Govil : Hi, thanks and I wanted to congratulate Kevin on announcement of your retirement. We will be sad to see you go but now we have a couple of more quarters to talk with you. I guess my first question is on the word merger comment that I think David you make that you're seeing strength there, I know last quarter you had said that you expect it to be better this year, but it didn't seem like we were really including much in the guide. I just want to get a sense of what you're including in the guide versus what could be upside based on what you're seeing. David Foss : I said in my comments, the convert merged slots and just to make sure nobody is clear when we reference convert merge, it's -- it happens when one of our institutions is acquiring another institution. They notify us well ahead of time, well before the conversion actually, or the acquisition actually happen. They notify us that they will need our help to convert the acquired institution onto the Jack Henry platform and so we hold those slots. In the past several weeks here, that volume has increased significantly, or customers contacting us to hold conversion slots and essentially sign contracts to lock those in.  And so that's why -- what I said in my comments was, every conversion slot now on the banking side of our business is filled for convert merge activity through the remainder of the fiscal year, and we're evaluating whether or not we need to add more teams. And the reason for that evaluation is we have to keep an eye on, does a deal fall through? Since they notify us well ahead of time and ask us to hold a slot and they they will contract in front of them. But does that deal fall through? We have -- we've been doing this for a long time. We're very good at predicting what's going to actually happen and what's not, but everything that we have today that is known, that is booked, is worked into the guidance that Kevin provided to you, but there is more potential opportunity out there.  We may stand up if demand justifies that, we may stand up an additional conversion team, or even 2 conversion teams, we've done that in the past. And so we'll just have to follow that as it goes. But what we know today is included in the guidance that Kevin has shared with you. But there is still potentially more opportunity there based on what happens with our customers. The key messaging there was just for you all to know that convert merge or M&A is back in the banking space. That not only is a real positive for us and that we have customers acquiring other customers and we generally are paid on account volume and transaction volumes. That's good for us when they get merged in. But then also for you to be aware that deconversion revenue will probably go up because we know that some of our customers will also be acquired away from us as M&A continues to grow. Vasu Govil : That's very helpful [Indiscernible] Thank you. And just a follow-up I had was on the payments segment, It has been to me coming into the quarter that morning, you would probably be the high watermark and then kind of level off from there. I didn't the revenues in the quarter were at that lighter than what we were modeling. I just am curious to see where they came in relative to your internal expectations. And I know debit volume rolled off a bit, is that probably impactful to your Payments segment?  And then if you could also comment on what's going on in the bill pay business. I know softer trends across the peer group, but, but if you comment on -- if you have any insights on, is that just more competition from digital wallet or for something else which is driving bill pay revenue to be flattish David Foss : So there's a lot in the -- on the payments line of course 3 and you highlighted there, so 3 primary components in the payments line for us. So the Payments segment for us, there's bill pay revenue, there's card revenue, dividend credit and then there is what we refer to as EPS enterprise payments solutions. The bill pay bill pay line or the bill pay business continues to be relatively flat. I mean, there's some growth, but as we've talked about on the call before, anybody who needs the bill pay solution has a bill pay solution. Volumes aren't really fluctuating. that much, so it's relatively flat in the bill pay business.  The card business is continuing to grow. We're seeing nice growth not only because we're adding customers, but because now as the pandemic numbers have dropped again, here in the early fall, transaction volumes, we've seen a definite correlation between transaction volumes increasing as infections have -- reported infections have dropped. And so that's a key part. But the enterprise payments business is continuing to grow very nicely at the smallest piece of that segment. But the fastest-growing piece of that segment.  And that is driven by remodel by capture, but also by it's origination's. And so we have a number of customers who have signed with that platform recently and some that we'll announce next year, I think as they come live, that we'll be continuing to drive big volumes through that platform. So it's the combination of those things, but I think are driving the payments revenue, and all of those are positioned well for continued growth in the coming year. Vasu Govil : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Kartik Mehta with Northcoast. Kartik Mehta : Hey, good morning, Dave and Kevin. Dave, I wanted to maybe get a little bit more on your sales pipeline question. I think when you spoke last earnings call, you talked about that FY2022 pipeline would be up 3% to 5%, if I remember my numbers right. And I'm wondering what's your expectations are, it sounds like things are going well, but it would be interesting what your expectations are for the growth in the pipeline for this fiscal year? David Foss : Yeah, that's a good question. I have no hesitation about reaffirming 3% to 5%. Can it be greater than 5%? It's little early probably for me to commit to that, but I will again say with no hesitation, 3 to 5%. And in fact on the high end of that, I easily sign up for 5% based on what we're seeing right now below the core, it's been interesting watching core deals as we've come out of the real trough of the pandemic.  And obviously the pandemic isn't over, but we're deals are really lumpy right now, but there is a tremendous amount of activity as far as side of the business. And then if you look at the rest of the suite of Jack Henry, the forecasts are looking or the pipelines are looking very, very strong right now. So I'm,-- like I say, very comfortable signing up for the high end of that guide and it could be even higher but I think we need a little more time under our belt here to make sure that I'm not overextending. Kartik Mehta : Kevin, I know you talked about [Indiscernible]margins in your idea, a little bit cautious, but you had an excellent quarter this quarter, it seems like margins are probably better than you thought. I'm wondering maybe your reluctance to think you will be better than the 50 basis points you talked about last fiscal year, is it just too early in your opinion or are there other things that might impact margins that we should be aware of. Kevin Williams : Yes. I mean, Kartik, there's so many moving parts this year that are coming back that weren't there last year. I mean, deconversion fees is obviously going to be higher. As Dave mentioned, convert merge I mean, M&A activity just, just drive so many different moving parts within our financials. I mean, so obviously travel is going to be a lot higher. There's other costs, there are salespeople are getting out in travelling more so, just just the travel expense is going to be higher. May as a possible that our total margins should be higher?  Yes. Obviously, the Q1 margins are proud of the highest of the year because of all the software subscription revenue that we recognized in Q1 for all the software has been delivered in the previous years. So this, this is high watermark for margins for the year. But the other thing I will say if [Indiscernible] was down almost 40% this quarter which -- which that actually helps our margins by hardware revenue being down, which is, I mean, it's samples we're but if hardware revenue would level earning will go back up a little bit for the year, because I'm sure IBM will come out with additional hardware upgrades. Could that impact our margins yes? So I mean, I'm still very comfortable that we can hit the 50 bps and could it be higher than that. Yes. But I'm separated stepping on that Lemia. Kartik Mehta : Thank you, Kevin. I really appreciate it. Thanks, Dave. Operator : Thank you., next you have Beep Heckman with DA and Davidson. Peter Heckmann : This is John on for Peter, is a quick question. Are you touched on that in the prepared remarks, but was expectation for deconversion fees. And how does it last? And then each quarter again? Kevin Williams : So we increased deconversion fees, we think is going to be somewhere around $42 to $43 million. And again, that's looking at the crystal ball because there -- we don't know for sure that's what's going to be that's just the indications that we're getting. But we think probably 80% of that will probably be in Q2 and Q3 based on what we know right now. So deconversion fees in Q2 and Q3 could be $15 million or so plus in each of those quarters. Peter Heckmann : Got it. Thank you. And that non-GAAP payments segment growth was 9%. What was the segments could you see that grew notably faster or slower than the segment average? David Foss : I assume you're referencing my comments earlier, John, about the three different pieces of the payments segment, is that what you are asking about? Peter Heckmann : Yeah, exactly. David Foss : So 3 pieces, bill pay, our card business debit and credit and then what we refer to as EPS enterprise payment solutions, which is [Indiscernible] SCH. The Enterprise Payment Solutions business is growing the fastest, but it's the smallest of those three components. So the card business is the largest, the bill pay business, second largest. Bill Pay, really relatively flat. It's growing a little bit, but like I said, most anybody who needs bill pay has Bill Pay and volumes don't change that much in that piece of the segment. But the card business is growing nicely both because of new customers that we're adding and because of just volumes picking up again. And then the fastest is also the smallest, which is Enterprise Payments. Peter Heckmann : Got it. Thank you so much. David Foss : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Next we have David Koning with Baird. David Koning : Yes. Hey, guys, thank you. And I guess, first of all, just as we look at the market, we hear a lot about the super apps and how they're progressing. Is there a much different that a super app can do than what kind of Banno client that's on the Banno system can do? And do you even do some work for a lot of the super as to how to help them grow as well? David Foss : Well, I am not exactly sure what you're including in the super app buckets. They've I mean, they others, there's lots of stuff going on out there. We are working. So the thing about the bantle platform is -- it is built to work with an open API based platform. So modern technology stack open API based platform, you saw -- hopefully you saw the press release we did in October where we announced the partnership and integration of finicity, Akoya, and Plaid. All of those relationships are designed to provide greater functionality on this digital platform to connect FinTech solutions to other FinTech solutions.  Our goal with the platform is not only to offer the best experience for the consumer and small business through a single digital experience, but also to provide the best platform in the industry to create that inter-connectivity of applications to other applications. The other thing that we're trying to do through all of that, and this is important when you compare to modern technology stack like we have with Banno, as compared to other things that are out there is we are close to being able to eliminate screen scraping.  And if you're not comfortable -- if you're not familiar with that term of screen scraping, that's what happens with older applications where a consumer, let's say you're trying to consolidate all of your accounts on one in one experience on one spot, one digital experience, well, the old approach, which most companies out there are using widely today is screen scraping, where the consumer provides their credentials, their log on and password into some central location, and that central location goes out on, essentially simulates being a consumer going on in pulling down balance information or you can probably imagine the security -- potential security and privacy issues that come along with that, and so we've been working very diligently for several years to eliminate all of that in our platforms. And they use this integration that we've done with Finicity, Akoya, and Plaid. And the other moves that we've made with our digital platform have us right on the cusp of eliminating all of that well ahead of anybody else, any of our traditional competitors when it comes to offering a truly state-of-the-art digital experience. David Koning : Got it. Yes, thanks because it looks to us like growth in core and really the whole business you're doing about as good or are actually better like your core segments about the best expand in a few years, In terms of growth, like it just seems like momentum is as strong as ever. There's no real like competitive changes in the environment if anything, it seems like the environment is -- is strengthening maybe for you,is that fair to say? David Foss : That it's fair to say, so we are you're -- you're accurate with signing and I've emphasized that many times signing core takeaways, gaining share on the core side of the business. But a lot of that is driven by all this other outstanding technology that we're delivering and the tight integration that we're doing not just with Jack Henry products, other Jack Henry products, but Jack Henry products to the other things out there in the industry that people want to be able to use the FinTech solutions out there.  We are providing that connectivity easily. In the press release again, but referring back to the Finicity Accordion Plaid Release, if you look at the headline it's zero-cost, zero-lift. We're doing all that for our customers, zero - costs, zero - lift. Why would you do that? A, it's the right thing to do, but B, in long-run, it's less expensive for us as a provider if our customers will adopt those types of things, all of that thought, all of that approach, all of that philosophy around delivering technology is being recognized in our industry and Jack Henry is getting credit for it and customers are moving to our platforms as a result. Kevin Williams : And Dave, one more thing, just remember the one of the big drivers in our core growth is the continued movement of existing on - prem customers to our private cloud because we get a nice lift of revenue and move those as Dave said in his opening comments, we signed 10 more in Q1 to make that move, and we are seeing larger FIs that are on - prem, they're electing to make that move as well. David Koning : Great. Well, thanks, guys. Good job. Kevin Williams : Thanks, guys. Operator : Think you. Next we have Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research Ken Suchoski : Hi, good morning, David and Kevin. Thanks for taking the questions here. I just want to follow-up on that last comment about the shift in a core customer from on-trend to the private cloud. I mean -- what's -- maybe you can help us understand the revenue lift that you might get from that on a per customer, per unit basis. Kevin Williams : So on average, if you look at the an on - prem -customer day, everything that they're paying us, which would be in-house maintenance could be disaster recovery, it could be hardware maintenance. There's several buckets in line items have revenue that they could be paying us. But on average, when an on - prem -customer moves to our private cloud, the revenue that we get out of that customer essentially doubles. And there is very little cost increase because remember, it's the exact same software, it's the exact same support organization. We've got the infrastructure in place of their data centers. There's very high margin from that additional revenue when we moved those customers from on - prem to our private cloud. Ken Suchoski : That's very helpful. And then maybe just a question on the payments segment, it looks like on a non-GAAP basis, the growth in this segment slowed from about 17% last quarter to 9% This quarter. What drove that slowdown and I guess what are your expectations for that segment going forward? David Foss : I don't recall the 17%. I mean, that segment is growing very well, we're very happy with what's happening in the segment.I don't remember us reporting 17% last quarter. Kevin Williams : Well, but you also got to remember that Last Quarter was compared to the previous years [Indiscernible] That was -- what was significantly impacted by COVID -- David Foss : Was the depth of payment Kevin Williams : -- it was the depth of payments in April and the first part of May in '20 so it was a very easy comp in -- for Q4 of '21 compared to Q4 '20. So I think the 9% growth we showed this quarter is probably more an example of what you're going to see for the entire fiscal year. David Foss : Right. Ken Suchoski : Okay. And then just last one from me just on the share repurchases. I don't think you guys bought back any stock in the quarter. I think in the prior quarter you had a larger buyback. I guess thoughts on overall capital allocation at this point and what are your thoughts on repurchases at the current stock price? Kevin Williams : Yeah. So I mean, obviously we're going to continue to buy back stock here in there. I will tell you that this quarter, one of the reasons that we were -- we didn't buy any stock back was we were actually trying to get some tax planning in place based on what the new administration was proposing on the table. Because we were going to use were potentially you significant amount of cash to pay upfront taxes for a number of reasons. But now now that the third, they are changing the corporate tax structure actually took a totally back out to where they're not even a change the 21%. It's a wildcard right now, but I mean, as the tax [Indiscernible] we figured out exactly where it's going to be. Obviously we use some of our capital buyback more stock during the year. Ken Suchoski : Thank you very much. Really appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Again, ladies and gentlemen, [Operators Instructions]. Next we have Dominic Gabriel with Oppenheimer. Dominic Gabriel : Okay, great. Thank you so much for taking the question. I appreciate the commentary on Banno and the partnerships with other fintechs. I guess what open APIs are typically adopted with Banno across your peers. It could you just offer that functionality in-house, maybe just discussed. The puts and takes life. Partner partnerships are the way to go versus just expanding the capabilities. Or maybe I'm just not understanding the dynamics there. And I just have a follow-up.Thank you. David Foss : Sure, yes. So I -- I'll -- I'll try not to be a -- I think you're misunderstanding the dynamics, so you said it yourself and I'll -- I'll just repeat that. When we use the term partnership, that doesn't mean that we're reselling somebody else's stuff, that we're exchanging revenue, that there -- there's something like that, or that we're missing a piece, in this day and age with all of the new feature function that's happening with FinTech and with the demand that our customers, that bankers have from their customers, their consumers, to use different -- different things, different pieces of technology that they've come across. The future for banking and the future for a provider like us is to provide open connectivity so that the customer -- our customer, the banker, can choose to integrate whatever they want to integrate into our platform.  What's we are moving toward -- what consumers are moving toward is, they are very sensitive to the fact that the data is their data, like I'm the consumer, it's my data, it's not your data, It's my data. And so it happens to be housed at this bank but I want to access to that data and so the bank is now more than ever very sensitive to that idea that they need to provide access to that data in a secure manner, to a variety of different sources that the consumer chooses to want to use, or that the bank may choose to want to use.  So we are continuing to innovate on our technology. And the reason that the Banno platform is so well regarded and has the highest ratings in the App Store is because we have the best functionality out there. But you can't do everything, right. Not every idea that every FinTech comes up, it's just not possible to write all of that code into one application. And so providing that platform for open connectivity is the best of all worlds. It gives us this reputation of being open and being innovative, but it also provides the banker the opportunity to connect whatever they want to connect into that platform and take advantage of the data for the benefit of their consumer, whether the consumer is an individual or if it's a small business. And so what -- what we're doing today is being recognized regularly as being really industry-leading in providing that open connectivity and that opportunity for the banker to choose as opposed to us going to them and say, ''You must use our platform whether you like it or not. '' And this is not new for us. We have always been extremely open on back from when Jack and Jerry started the Company 45 years ago, we've always had -- because we started just a core provider and we had to let them use any third-party.  I mean if you think about our investor confidence Dave refer to as open opening comments, I mean, we typically have well over a 100 or an over 300 other vendors at our tech fair to show up to where so we've always been open. The fact that open API's just makes it that much easier for a third-party to integrate into our core solutions? Dominic Gabriel : Perfect. Thank you so much for all that clarification. I really appreciate it. And then, as you think about the net M&A activity affecting your partners, how do you think that could change the geography of your average asset size of your underlying banking credit, credit union mix? And where do you typically win, and which sized clients get taken away from the Jack Henry platform? And then, perhaps -- sorry. Just a final on this, for clients that do get taken away, and that create these deconversion fees, what about the win back rates? Perhaps they -- the one that got taken out was using Jack Henry, really liked it, and then they explain the benefits there, and then you could win, perhaps, the entire relationship later. Does that happen? Maybe you can discuss all those factors. Thanks so much. David Foss : Dominic, you've got a lot packed into that one question, but they're things I love to talking about. Dominic Gabriel : Sorry. David Foss : Give me about an hour-and-a-half, I'll try and fill you in. No, seriously. First up, we -- when M&A happens -- I'll answer your question from the beginning and work forward. Does it happen that customers are acquired away and then they come back to Jack Henry? Yes, that happens is -- and in fact, it's more often than you might think where somebody gets acquired the logical thing is for the acquiring institution to convert them to whatever they're running. And then once they get integrated in, the people have been acquired, suddenly start to say, we had a better on the old platform than we have in a new platform let us tell you guys what we used to be able to do with Jack Henry. And it's often times the combination of the technology and the relationships. This is a relationship business partnership is a key. Part of what we do. And so often times the acquired institution will educate the acquirer on what it was like do business with Jack Henry. So we do when those occasionally. The other thing that when once in a while is what -- is let's say that an acquirer is targeting one of our institutions, we know that that's happening. We can often time sell the acquirer on converting to the Jack Henry platform as opposed to the acquirer using whatever it was they had before the -- before the acquisition was announced or before the deal was announced. And so, those -- we refer to those as winter merger, and those we've been successful at. But the heart of your question -- the beginning of your question was -- that is the power.  The beginning of your question. Sorry, we have a little phone issue going on here. The beginning of your question. Most of the M&A activity is happening at the low end of the range. Real small institutions being acquired by large institutions. And we don't tend to serve the real small institution. That tends to be good for us. That usually, we are the benefactor, one of our institutions acquiring a smaller institution, as opposed to ours being acquired away. But to the very beginning of your question, what that means is, our asset base among our customers is growing because those larger customers in our base are acquiring smaller customers. And so over time, we will continue to grow as far as average asset size. Dominic Gabriel : Thank you so much. I really appreciate all of that. Thank you. Operator : Being there are no further questions, I will now turn the call back over to the speakers. David Foss : Again, we're pleased with the overall results of our ongoing operations. I want to thank all of our associates for the way they've handled these challenging times by taking care of the sales and our customers, and continue to work hard to improve our Company, and to continue moving forward for the future. All of us at Jack Henry continuing to focus on what is best for our customers and our shareholders. Again, I want to thank you for joining us today. And with that, Brian, will you please provide the replay number? Operator : Right? On call replay will be available 2 hours after the call is concluded [Operator's Instructions]. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker for today to Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin D. Williams: Thank you Olivia. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry & Associates second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. I am Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasure and on the call with me today is David Foss, Board Chair and CEO. The format for our call this morning will be just a little different than our normal format we have typically used in the past. But just as a warning the opening comments will take a little longer than normal. In just a minute I will turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the state of our business, financial and sales performance for the quarter, comments regarding the industry in general, and some other key initiatives that we have in place. Then after Dave concludes his comments, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market closed and provide comments regarding our updated guidance for our fiscal year 2022, provided in the release. At that point Dave will have some additional comments and updates that he will make on the press release that we put out Monday morning. Then at the conclusion of those comments we will then open the lines up for a traditional Q&A. First, I need to remind you that this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends, or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled risk factors and forward-looking statements. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found in yesterday's press release. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave. David B. Foss: Thank you Kevin, good morning everyone. I am pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth. As always I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our second quarter while also continuing to deal with the impacts of the ongoing pandemic. As Kevin mentioned in his opening remarks we're going to conduct today's call a little differently from the cadence of past calls. I'll start with comments regarding the performance of the business in the quarter, then Kevin will share detailed financial results. Instead of moving to Q&A after Kevin's comments however I'm going to come back and conduct a detailed review with you of an exciting new product technology modernization strategy for our company. This is an important update for you as we believe this strategy which we've been working on for more than two years will fundamentally define the evolution of our company and our industry. We will address questions after that strategy review.  With that let\u2019s shift our focus to look at our performance for the quarter we completed in December. As of the end of the quarter we continued to operate with well over 90% of our employees working full time remote and continue to evaluate options regarding an appropriate return to office target date. At this time we have no published date but we have proven that our business can perform well in a remote pasture, so we don't feel any significant pressure to change that. For Q2 of fiscal 2022, total revenue increased 17% for the quarter and increased 11% on a non-GAAP basis. Consistent with our previous guidance the deconversion revenues -- the deconversion fees were up almost $25 million over the prior year quarter which led to the extremely strong GAAP revenue performance. But you should note that even without the increased deconversion revenue this was a very strong quarter. Turning to the segments, we again had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 15% for the quarter and increased by 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payment segment also performed very well posting an 18% increase in revenue this quarter and a 13% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses with a 17% increase in revenue this quarter and an 11% increase on a non-GAAP basis.  As I mentioned in the press release our sales teams again had a very solid quarter as they booked the largest sales quarter in the history of the company. Those of you who follow us closely will note that our last quarterly sales record was set only six months ago. In the second quarter we incurred 15 competitive core takeaways and an additional 15 deals to move existing in house clients to our private cloud delivery [ph]. As we have discussed on prior calls our convert merge backlog is a good indicator for us of what to expect with coming mergers and acquisitions within our base of customers. Our contract volume in this area continues to grow to the point that we have now added one new conversion team on the banking side of our business. Additionally, we will be adding another team next quarter on the credit union side of the business and we're evaluating adding one or two more teams in the near future based on ongoing demand. We continue to see good success with our new card processing solutions signing 13 new debit processing clients this quarter and six new credit clients. We also continue to see great success signing clients to our panel of digital suite with 44 new contracts in Q2. Speaking of our digital suite we are continuing to implement new financial institutional clients on the Banno platform at a similar pace to recent quarters. At the end of Q2 we surpassed 6.6 million registered users on the platform and our Banno platform continues to hold one of the highest consumer ratings in the app store.  A couple weeks ago we announced a significant promotion for a key member of our leadership team. After more than 10 very successful years with our company, Greg Adelson has been promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer. As I noted in the press release, Greg will retain all of his prior responsibilities as COO but will now be responsible for leading the recently formed digital and technology office headed by Ben Metz. I would like to congratulate Greg on this well deserved promotion and congratulate Ben on his moved to his new position. Both will play a major role in our success going forward.  As some of you know we've continued to make major advances with our environmental, social, and governance initiatives and the Board has established a quarterly cadence to discuss industry matters. Jack Henry\u2019s next sustainability report will be published on March 31st and will highlight our major advances in this area during the past year. We will be able to access this new report through sustainability website link from our Investor Relations site. In January cornerstone advisors published results of their annual survey of bank and credit union executives. According to that study, 84% of financial institutions in our target market expect to increase their technology spending in 2022 with 24% of them indicating an increase of greater than 10% year-over-year. This correlates with the information we're receiving from other sources which puts the average expected increase in tax spending for 2022 in our markets at greater than 5%. I think that pent up demand is reflected in the continued influx of RFPs we are receiving and the ongoing interest in Jack Henry Technology Solutions.  As we begin the second half of our fiscal year our sales pipeline is very robust and we continue to be optimistic about the strengths of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our clients, our ability to expand our customer relationships, the spending environment, and our long term prospects for success. With that I will turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin D. Williams: Thanks Dave. During the quarter services support revenue increased 18% compared to the prior year quarter. As Dave mentioned deconversion rate was up 24.7 million for the quarter compared to last year. License, hardware, and invitation [ph] revenue combined were actually up 10% compared to the prior year. Our data processing and hosting fees on our private and public cloud offerings continue to show strong growth in the quarter compared to previous year growing by 11% for the quarter. On a non-GAAP basis total support to services grew 8% for the quarter compared to the prior year. Our processing revenues increased 15% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the same quarter last fiscal year on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The increase was primarily driven by higher card volumes from new customers installed last year and increased debit and credit card usage from existing customers.  Our Jack Henry digital revenue continues to show strong growth as demand for a manual digital platform continues to be very strong. Total revenue was up 17% in the quarter compared to last year and on a reported GAAP basis. David B. Foss: I'm getting reports that it is really hard to hear because of feedback. Olivia, can you hear us. Operator : Yes, sir we can hear you but there are some feedback on the background. David B. Foss: [Technical Difficulty]. So Olivia, shall I call in on a different line. Operator : Yes, you can try that or would you like me to dial out for you. David B. Foss: That's fine dial me. Operator : Okay. You are now back in. David B. Foss: Yeah, but we are still getting feedbacks, so it must be your end. Operator : Yes, I am still hearing feedback from that line. Maybe try from a different line. David B. Foss: Now that is you, we're on a different line. So Olivia can you hear us. Operator : Yes, your voice is clear but when you speak it does have a lot of sound from love background. David B. Foss: But when you speak it also has that. What are you doing to address this. We can't do anything... [Technical Difficulty]. So Olivia, someone in your team is doing something to address this. Operator : Yes, I am not hearing the background sound anymore. You are now pretty clear now. David B. Foss: Okay, so I have no idea what's going on. Kevin D. Williams: Okay. So services forward revenue increased 18% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the same quarter a year ago. As Dave mentioned deconversion was up 25 million as we sort of guided for the quarter compared to last year's quarter. License, hardware, and invitation revenue combined were actually up 10% compared to the prior year. Our data processing hosting revenue and our private and public cloud offerings continue to show strong growth in the quarter compared to previous year growing by 11%. On a non-GAAP basis total support and service revenue grew 8% for the quarter compared to the prior year.  Our processing revenue increased 15% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the same period last year on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis because all the non-GAAP items are up in support and services line. The increase was primarily driven by higher card volumes from new customers installed last year and increased debit and credit card usage from existing customers. Our Jack Henry digital revenue continues to show very strong growth as demand for our Banno digital platform continues to be very strong. Total revenue was up 17% for the quarter compared to last year on a GAAP basis, an increase of 11% on a non-GAAP basis. Our cost of revenue was up 10% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with customer maintenance of license cost, increased hardware cost, card and transaction processing increase in line with related revenue growth, and also higher personnel costs compared to a year ago. Research and development expense increased 12% for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to personnel costs. Our SG&A expense increased 26% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to same quarter. The increase was due primarily again to increase personnel costs and travel costs compared to last year and last year we also had a gain on sale of assets which made for a tough recall.  Our reported consolidated operating margins increased from 22.2% last year to 25.4% in the current year for a 320 bps increase. On a non-GAAP basis our operating margins expanded from 23.3% last year to 21.7% this year for 40 bps expansion. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased to 23.6 compared to 23.1 in the same quarter a year ago. Net income grew 33% to 95.7 million for the second fiscal quarter compared to 72 million last year with earnings per share of $1.30 for the quarter compared to $0.94 last year for a $0.36 or 38% increase year-over-year. For cash flow, our total amortization increased 2% for the quarter, I'm sorry, year-to-date compared to the last year due to capitalized software projects being placed in the service. Included in total amortization is the amortization of intangibles relating to acquisitions was just decreased to 8.3 million year-to-date compared to 8.9 million last year. Depreciation expense actually decreased 3% compared to the first six months of the prior year. Operating cash flow was 197.4 million for the year-to-date which is up from 194 million last year which is primarily due to increased net income during the first half compared to previous year and the timing and change of various operating assets and liabilities considered in the calculation of operating cash flow. We invested 101.1 million back into our company through CAPEX, purchased and capitalized software. Our free cash flow which is operating cash flow less CAPEX and CAPS software and then adding back net proceeds from disposal of assets was 96.3 million for the first six months of fiscal year. During the first six months we also spent 193.9 million to purchase 1.25 million shares of stock through the treasury and we paid dividends of 67.7 million in the first six months for a total return to shareholders of 261.6 million in the first half of fiscal 2022.  A couple of comments our balance sheet as of June 30th. Our cash position of 29.1 million is compared to 147.8 million a year ago. Our revolver balance has bounced to 240 million compared to zero a year ago. With the change in cash and debt, balance is primarily related to the 4.1 million shares purchased in the last 18 months. Our return on average assets for the trailing 12 months is 15.2%. Our return on average equity for the trailing 12 months is 24.6% and our return on invested capital for the trailing 12 months is 22.6%. Also yesterday we provided a GAAP and non-GAAP updated revenue guidance in the press release. We also provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP revenue in the release following the segment information. However just to be clear, this guidance continues to assume that the country continues to be open and the economy continues to improve. Obviously if things were to go differently then this guidance will be revised.  For GAAP revenue growth for fiscal 2022 based on the amounts of the release yesterday, our revenue guidance has been updated to reflect a higher than a little over 10% growth over fiscal 2021 which we now anticipate deconversion revenue to be approximately $49 million to $50 million for the full year. And right now it appears the Q3 deconversion revenue will be approximately half of the deconversion revenue we saw in Q2. If your remember, on the last call we said that the big percentage of the deconversion fees we saw coming were in Q2 and Q3. For non-GAAP revenue growth we have updated our guide to be just under 9% for the fiscal year. Obviously these will be updated during the year. We continue to anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins to improve a little in FY 2022 compared to last year. But I continue to be somewhat cautious on guidance, guiding too much of a non-GAAP operating margin expansion as we will continue to have headwinds on license and hardware revenue as we continue to move core customers from on-premise to private cloud, also personnel costs and travel costs from on-premise to private cloud. Also personnel costs and travel costs continue to increase significantly compared to last year. However, we're still confident that full year non-GAAP operating margins will expand approximately 50 bps or little higher but also a reminder that the highest margin quarter is now our Q1 quarter due to software subscription revenue under ASC 606.  Our effective tax rate for FY 2022 continues to be projected to be slightly higher than 23% compared to the prior year rate. However significant change in the corporate tax structure could change this guidance. Our updated FY 2022 GAAP EPS guide is a range of $4.75 to $4.82 which is an increase from the previous guidance of $4.64 to $4.73, which is a 15% to 17% increase over prior year actual EPS. I will now turn the call back over to Dave for some detailed comments regarding the technology modernization press release that we put out on Monday morning of this week. David B. Foss: Thank you Kevin. In this third section of today's call I would like to provide all of you with an outline of our product technology modernization strategy. This is not a product announcement, it's a strategy discussion designed to set an expectation regarding the evolution of our company. I won\u2019t be sharing any specific sales, revenue, or profitability numbers with you today and I probably won't be able to answer all of your questions. I want to be clear about that up front, I'm sharing this with you today because it is important for you to understand how Jack Henry plans to innovate and remain a leader in our industry for many years to come. Many of the recent innovations we have made and we will continue to see are directly tied to this multi-year strategy and we have got developers working behind the scenes on this new technology for more than two years. The strategy we're sharing today further expands upon Jack Henry\u2019s highly successful Open API digital banking platform.  Before we get into the details let me first set some context for this strategy. You heard me say many times that we are a well-rounded financial technology company focused on serving the technology needs of community and regional financial institutions. That is our primary audience and we've been focused on that market for the last 45 years. Today we serve close to 8500 financial institutions through approximately 300 different solutions and we have more than 850 Fintech providers currently connected into our ecosystem. While other providers in our space have shifted direction over the last few years, we continue to be 100% focused on serving the full and complete financial technology needs of community and regional financial institutions. The reason we and our clients have been successful for so long as we have continued to evolve our business in a measured and thoughtful way to help our clients meet the changing needs of their account holders.  In the early days of our company when people visited branches for their financial needs, our focus was on automating everything that was being done on paper. We reported that as the first generation of financial technology solutions, then the internet came along and it caused disruption as people began to move away from visiting local branches due to a desire to conduct more business online. What did we do then, we made more services available via the internet to ensure a seamless experience between online, mobile, and branch banking. That was the genesis for this second generation of financial technology. Today we are at a pivotal point similar to when the internet was introduced. Things are changing to the point that our industry requires someone to innovate a next generation solution. Many non-traditional banks have entered the market blurring the lines between traditional and non-traditional providers and people have learned how to manage their finances digitally.  At the same time a new hybrid monetary ecosystem has emerged as new currencies like crypto have become more mainstream and are actively traded through platforms like Coinbase. It is also becoming more clear that Central Bank Digital Currencies or CBDC's are likely on the near-term horizon and our clients will need a strategy and technology solutions to address customer demand for these options. So why does all this matter, the simple answer is these dynamics are fundamentally changing how people want and expect to bank. This is especially true with the younger generation. A recent Javelin [ph] report shows that non-banks now provide 65% of financial relationships for Gen Ys and 69% for Gen Zs. Fewer are going into the branches or calling customer service. They expect to do everything digitally.  The emergence of new financial apps has created an unprecedented level of financial fragmentation. It's not uncommon for someone to use between 30 and 40 different financial applications and services to address their financial needs. This may be great for some people but this fragmentation also impacts the ability of people to make informed financial decisions and that can lead to poor management of their finances. For community and individual [ph] financial institutions, this digital transformation possess both upside opportunities and downside risk. To capture the opportunity our clients need a clear growth strategy focused on the customers and customer niches they will serve. They need a product and services strategy that enables them to provide the best solutions to their customers while delivering service in a customer's moments of need and relevance. And they need a technology modernization strategy that makes all of this possible, even as additional changes occur in the future. That's where we come in.  Let's talk about what Jack Henry is doing to help our clients capitalize on this opportunity through our product technology modernization strategy. Let me start with our end goal here and then I'll talk about how we're going to get there. At the highest level, we are focused on developing a single, modern open banking platform that enables easy access to a broad ecosystem of Jack Henry solutions and high grade third party FinTech offerings. What do we mean by next generation technology? Essentially, it is technology that is component based, services are isolated, and able to run independently giving community and regional financial institutions the ability to customize and build platforms that work best for them and their account holders. It's technology that is cloud native, which means it's built on the cloud and not just hosted on the cloud. This is a really important distinction from other public cloud offerings because it enables greater flexibility, faster upgrades, and efficient scale. It's technology that is open to allow our clients to have the best of both worlds. They have access to our best of breed capabilities, and they can embed Fintech\u2019s of their choice into the Jack Henry ecosystem. It's technology that is not tightly coupled to any legacy products, databases, or other technologies. And it is technology that is digitally centric which puts the financial institution at the center of their customers financial lives.  Over time, we will be applying the same next generation technology approach to virtually all of our services across the Jack Henry platform. There are four parts of our technology modernization strategy, these parts are related but they are not linear. First, we are redefining the core processing system. Second, we're providing multiple integration options supported by our open philosophy and technology. Third, we're delivering industry leading capabilities across a single next generation platform. And fourth, we will operate as more than a core processor by providing a full banking ecosystem.  Let's talk about each of these four areas of focus. The first is to redefine core processing system and what the core processing system is. Essentially, we are unbundling services that traditionally would be in a core processing system, and making them discrete services that can be customized and re-bundled. Examples of services that we would unbundle in place of the public cloud are new account opening via our processing, deposit processing and account servicing. Since these services will be housed in a safe secure cloud environment, we can easily make updates so that they can stay current independent of the other services used by our client. This benefits our clients and that they will have greater flexibility, options to choose which services make the most sense for them, and speed to market. We already have several clients running in a beta testing environment with the first of these unbundled services. I want to be clear that re-bundling core services in the public cloud is a longer term strategy. We plan for this to happen in stages over the next few years and we expect no immediate impact on our existing core processing systems. Over time Jack Henry clients will be able to choose if they want to use cloud native services, and they will not be faced with what we have today as a full core conversion. Meanwhile, we will continue to invest in and service our existing cores at the same rate as in the past.  The second part of our strategy is to provide multiple integration options supported by our open philosophy and technology. You've heard me say before that Jack Henry has always operated with an open philosophy and we are continuing to expand on this. A key part of this is integrations and the flow of data between them. We have several data integration options, some of which we've offered for a long time. The newest one is real time data streaming, which is constant data streaming to all systems on the platform at the same time. Those systems are updated in real time, there is no waiting for information to flow through overnight or for someone to respond to a request. This is essential to support the real time nature of services like payments and fraud detection. The third part is delivering industry leading capabilities across a single next generation platform. We've made significant innovations to our capabilities in many key areas of focus for our clients. You've heard me talk about our success with several of these in the past including digital banking, our pay center payments hub, our lending suite, and our new financial crime solution. This third part of our strategy brings all of our best breed capabilities into a single technology platform that has the same look and feel, and the same underlying technology infrastructure. This is a big deal. None of the single point solution technology providers can capitalize on the use of this next generation technology like we can.  The fourth part of our strategy is operating as more than a core processor by providing a full banking ecosystem. This is what pulls it all together. We just talked about creating a single technology platform that contains our best of breed solutions. This ecosystem goes beyond that by also providing access to leading Fintechs and third parties such as Dell, Finicity, Autobooks, and Alloys all through a single platform. We have a significant head start on building this ecosystem, because we have 800 -- over 850 integrations completed and are adding more each day. Additionally, we are the only platform provider to have relationships with all four major financial data aggregators, Finicity, [indiscernible]. These companies enable financial institutions to provide their account holders a complete financial picture in a safe and secure way that eliminates screen scraping. Additionally, we currently have relationships with all of the major public cloud providers and are running workloads with all of them today. We will be offering a broad range of selection and/or optionality with each provider, as well as private cloud options, bringing the best technology to bear for our clients. I know this is a lot of new information so let's use an analogy to tie all of this together. Think of any traditional core solution as a sport utility vehicle, an SUV. Regardless of who you're buying your SUV from, it's still an SUV, it's not a pickup, it's not a luxury car, you can hook a trailer to the back, you can put a luggage carrier on top, you can tint the windows and repaint the exterior, and you have a very nice, very functional SUV, but it's an SUV. All of the core providers in the industry have been in the business for years of selling really nice SUVs. At Jack Henry for clients to choose to adopt our next generation technology strategy, this new approach will enable them to choose how they want to customize their vehicle. We'll sell them the frame with a pre-established wheelbase, but the buyer can choose whether they want a V8, V6, or a plugin hybrid engine. For us that might mean AWS, Azure, or private cloud.  Additionally, they can decide if they want an SUV, a pickup, or a luxury sedan built on that same frame. They can buy the components if they're built correctly, buy the components from Jack Henry, or from another supplier because the components if they're built correctly, will fit in our vehicle without any modification. In this scenario, Fintech solutions are aftermarket add ons, they can be built right into our ecosystem, leveraging reusable components to give the Jack Henry client a tightly integrated, purpose built, and efficient solution even as some of the components aren\u2019t purchased from Jack Henry. This, of course, is an extension of the open philosophy Jack Henry has supported for most of our history.  Although we will offer the flexibility for our clients to configure their offering in any number of ways, we believe that because we offer that flexibility, and many best of breed solutions, most clients who are charting their strategies for the future will want to buy most of the components in a bundle from Jack Henry. If the client wishes to purchase a bundle, just like what we refer to as a core solution today, we will certainly offer them that option. This strategy puts the community and regional financial institution at the center of their customers financial lives. And it helps address the financial fragmentation I talked about earlier. In the end, our clients will benefit from all of this because they will be able to build, customize, and evolve digital experiences and products. They can offer access to leading edge services and capabilities, whether through Jack Henry or a third party through a single platform to create unique value that their competitors simply can't deliver. And they'll offer personal service in moments of need and moments of relevance so they can sustain their competitive advantage of service and trust. I know your first questions will be how much will this cost and what additional revenue will it generate, so let me address those. On the cost question. We continue to invest about 14% of our revenue in research and development and technology. That will not change. In fact, I mentioned that we've been investing in this strategy for more than two and a half years. And we've continued to invest in existing systems while maintaining our 14% spin. We've been able to do that because that 14% commitment is based on a rising revenue number. This is important for our existing loyal base of clients because it means we can continue to support all of our current core and complementary solutions, at the same rate as before, even as we invest in this new strategy.  As to additional revenue, it's really too early to say. As I said, this is a long term strategy for us and it will not happen overnight. That said, there are certain things that we are doing now, such as building out our own capabilities and rolling out new services based on this strategy. And I can tell you that we have already won some new deals because of this strategy and we expect that to continue. Why? Because most financial institution CEOs know they need modern technology and they want it procured from a company like ours, that has a 45 year track record of delivering and supporting a broad set of capabilities and solutions in a manner that is responsive to their evolving need for banking as a service options to their customers.  Community and Regional financial institutions are the lifeblood of main street America. As we've discussed, however, many of them are at crossroads. Personal service and experience they are known for is being disrupted by technology as non-traditional financial service providers have entered the market. The way people bank has fundamentally changed especially for the younger generation. This has created fragmentation as consumers and businesses try to manage their finances across multiple providers. As a well-rounded financial technology company, Jack Henry is in a unique position to provide modern technology and services to help community and regional financial institutions capitalize on this opportunity and strengthen connections with their accountholders.  I believe that 2022 is the most significant year for our company since the early 2000s, when we executed our ProfitStar strategy, and that strategy turned into a game changer for us. I sincerely believe that the strategy is right and the long term opportunity will be significant for our company and our clients. You should expect to hear a lot more about our work around this strategy as we move forward. With that, I'll turn it back to Kevin to introduce Q&A. Kevin D. Williams: Thanks, Dave, what a great update on our strategies and we are so excited about this. And as Dave mentioned, I'm sure after all that information you probably got more questions than we have answers. But again, as Dave said, this is not a short-term thing. This is a long-term strategy for Jack Henry. So with that, this now concludes our opening comments. We're now ready to take questions regarding the quarter or our strategy of day to day provided. Olivia, will you please open the call lines up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Rayna Kumar with UBS. Your line is open. Rayna Kumar : Good morning Dave and Kevin. Thanks for all the details on your technology modernization program. Just a few questions on that, is there any change in your competitive environment that has prompted you to alter your strategy? And second, if you can talk about your pricing strategy tied to the technology modernization, that would be very helpful? Kevin D. Williams: Sure, thank you Rayna. I wouldn't say that this was driven by something we saw as far as competitors are concerned, again, we've been working on this for years. We first started developing this strategy four years ago. We started, coders started programming about two and a half years ago as I mentioned earlier. So this wasn't as much driven by anything that we saw our competitors doing specifically, it was driven by the things that I outlined there, the disruption that's happening among financial services and the concern that we had for our customers being positioned to compete effectively in the future. And so the question for us is, how do we ensure that those customers are enabled with great technology so that they can compete going forward.  As to your second question, I started my comments by saying, I know there will be questions that you will ask that I won't be positioned to answer today. This is a long term strategy. But you know us well enough to know that we deliver solutions today in a cloud environment, we know how to price those solutions effectively in a cloud environment. This is us moving on to the public cloud as opposed to private cloud with this strategy. But we will price our solutions in a similar manner to what we've done in the past. It's just that the solutions will be unbundled as compared to selling a no Big Bang core solution. It will be an unbundled offering to our customers, but the long term strategy as far as pricing will be similar to what you've seen us do in the past. Rayna Kumar : That's very helpful. And a question on the quarter, so your adjusted payments segment revenue that was up 13% in the quarter, very strong. Can you break down some of the drivers of that growth and how we should be thinking about the payments revenue growth in the back half of this year or the back half of your fiscal year 2022? David B. Foss: Well, I'll take the first and then I'll let Kevin chime in here. So the drivers really things that we've highlighted in the past, the payment segment is made up of three different components, it is our bill pay business, our card business, and our business we refer to as enterprise payment solutions, which is what has captured an ACH origination. As we piloted many times, the bill pay business, although it's a very successful business, it's not a ton of growth in bill pay, it's a slow grower. But really the cards business and the enterprise payments business, both of them have continued to post real nice growth in those two areas, the payments business. So it's those two that are driving the continued growth, we're adding new customers in both areas, and so it's new customer additions, plus organic growth, same store sales growth from the customers that we already have. And as far as the look forward, I'll ask Kevin to comment on that. Kevin D. Williams: Yeah, so I agree. I mean, our enterprise payment solutions continues to be the fastest growing of the three and continues to become a larger percentage, which both, actually all three of those components have a very nice margin to them. And we think we'll continue to see nice margin expansion in our payments, as we continue to add new debit and credit and EPS customers. So I think those are going to change these drivers, right. And I think that growth is sustainable for the foreseeable future. Rayna Kumar : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Vasu Govil with KBW. Your line is open. Vasu Govil : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Dave, first one for you on the new technology initiative, a lot of good info. And I know you've sort of characterized it as a long term strategy but what time frame are we looking at for you to realize this and the vision of having a customizable core, and what will be the strategy around converting existing clients to this new core? And then just to follow-up on that, I know it's too early to comment on revenue contribution, but help us think about how much of this initiative is to drive incremental revenue opportunity versus upgrading existing customers to preserve share in the market? David B. Foss: So there's a lot wrapped up in there. So one of the comments that I made as I was walking through the strategy is the fact that we have customers today in beta with some of the components that you would think of as core traditionally. They're in beta today. So we will have customers live later this calendar year with different components. But as far as, if you think about a core system, there are a whole bunch of different functions within a core and so all those functions are in the process of being unbundled and rewritten to function on this new platform. And so it'll be over the course of years that that will happen. But you'll see in the relatively near term, you'll see customers who will deploy what people in the industry refer to as a side core, where they're doing a digital only core that has a positive gathering machine, probably with a different brand. You'll see us doing that in the relatively near-term with customers, and then all the rest of the functionality will come over time.  The really good news in all of this, I'm thrilled about the strategy overall, but the really good news is the platform is there already, we've created the platform, we've created all these connections. So I referenced the 850 Fintechs that we are connected to already. You might ask well, how did that happen, how did you do that so fast? Well, we already had many of these connected to our various technologies as far as the tools that we used to connect Fintechs into our legacy solutions. Well, we were able to port those over, we rewrote the Jack -- what we refer to as the Jack Henry gateway, rewrote it to run to this new platform, but didn't break those connections with all those people that we've worked with in the past. So now they can take advantage of the new platform, without them having to do any work on their side, if they're already connected into us through the Jack Henry gateway. They aren\u2019t allowed to do any additional work but they've gained this ability now to connect into these Jack Henry systems for all these Fintechs that we've been working with over time. And so that's another advantage with this strategy.  As far as migrating customers across, whether they're rendering a Jack Henry core or not at the time what you'll see happen is they will start to consume these services that will be available to customers, whether they're on a Jack Henry core or not, they'll be able to consume those services, they'll be able to access the platform, and then what that means is they can go through a conversion without a big bang conversion. So we won't talk in the future about doing a core conversion anymore. People will start to consume services and move over to the new platform at their pace. If they want to do a big bang conversion, they can do that. If they want to consume services so that it's not as disruptive to their employees and their customers, they can do that and kind of manage it over time. And so depending on the model that our customer chooses to employ with Jack Henry, that'll depend on when new revenue comes flowing in, and how that flows in. As far as the last part of your question about is this simply a strategy to retain existing customers, absolutely not. I mean, we think our customers are -- we've shared this with some customers under the covers already making sure they know where we're going, the response has been overwhelmingly positive. So we certainly believe that our existing customers, like the fact that we're protecting their future for them, protecting their investment in Jack Henry Solutions for them. But as I mentioned in my comments, we know some of the customers that have signed new core deals with us and I mentioned, we just signed 15 in the quarter last quarter. We know some of them are signing, because they've been exposed to the strategy of the [ph] future, they be partnered with a technology provider that's helping to position them for the future, and make sure that they have easy connectivity into all these different Fintechs. So, it's been great response so far, the people that know what we're doing, existing customers are not, and we're excited about this opportunity. Vasu Govil : Thank you, that's a lot of great color. And just two quick ones for Kevin, first, on just the margin guide of flight expansion year-on-year. Just wondering if we've seen sort of solid trends in the first half of this year, and the guide would then imply that there's some margin contraction that might happen in the back half. And just curious if there are any incremental items that will weigh on margins in the back half versus what you had previously expected? And the follow-up I have is on just free cash flow. I know there's typically some seasonality in the second quarter, but even on a trailing 12 month basis it seems like it's lagging what it historically has been. So maybe if you could talk about what's driving that trend and what you expect for free cash flow conversion -- going forward? Kevin D. Williams: Yes. So on margins, we're probably a little conservative on the back half. But remember, I mean Q1 under the new revenue rec rules and under ASC 606, the margin in Q1 are so strong, but it's hard to keep up with that when you're recognizing so much revenue without the related expense in Q1. So I think our margin expansion for the year is 50 bps. And also, as I said in opening comments, I mean, our travel costs and personnel costs continue to go up. I mean it's just -- there are some challenges out there to retain talent, and we're focused on that. So we're probably a little conservative, but I'm still very bullish that we can maintain a 50-plus bps margin expansion this year and see where it goes from there. As far as free cash flow, as you -- obviously, I mean, our strong orders and free cash flow is Q1 and Q4 because of the billing of our annual maintenance in June 1st, and our annual maintenance billings is roughly $240 million to $245 million, that's what it should be this year, and we collect all of that in Q1 and Q2, which that drives a lot of the free cash flow. So we're a little behind where we were last year. Will we catch up to where we were last year, probably, I really doubt it. I don't know if we get back to 100% conversion of net income to free cash flow this year, but we will make up a lot of ground in Q4. Vasu Govil : Great, thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Hey, good morning. Dave, just on your core new strategy, do you think that will mean that you'll have more partnerships, so maybe more partnerships at a customer? David B. Foss: Yes, I hesitate to use the word partnership because I think there's a lot implied in that, that people assume there's rev share and our sales reps are reselling somebody else's technology. So I usually shy away from the word partnership. Will there be more third parties involved in our customers? Maybe, maybe not. The thing that Jack Henry has already known for is for being the most open provider out there on the core side as far as our willingness and ability to easily connect into our systems. And so it will depend on the financial institution deciding what is their -- what's the strategy for them, what's the right strategy, and what do they need to connect into our infrastructure to enable that strategy. So I don't know that I would say that just on its surface, because, again, a lot of people -- a lot of our customers, I think, already take advantage of the open solutions that we've been providing for years. Kartik Mehta : Okay, I guess I was trying to get to, do you think that if there are more third parties involved, that changes the revenue dynamics for Jack Henry? David B. Foss: I don't think there's any negative in that for Jack Henry. I think there is a tremendous amount of positive in that because of all the technology solutions that will be living in the same environment, living on the same platform that will be offered by Jack Henry, certainly no negative in that as far as I'm concerned. Kevin D. Williams: Yes, Kartik, as Dave said, we're tied into 850 Fintechs so I mean that's a very large number already in there. So will that number go up, maybe, but on a per customer basis, right, it will depend on the customers' needs. Kartik Mehta : And then just on the contracts that you have, obviously, inflation having a big impact. Are you able to get increases, annual increases because of the contracts you have or is there any limitations to what you can do with your customers? David B. Foss: Yes, there are CPI accelerators built into virtually every contract -- obviously not every contract but in virtually every contract, there are CPI accelerators that are built into those. So we're doing the same evaluation I think I talked about in the last call that evaluation, we're going through on a product basis and overall as a company to determine where are those right opportunities to engage or leverage those CPI opportunities. Kartik Mehta : And then just one last question. Dave, I think you talked about adding a conversion team to your banking platform and then eventually one to your credit union platform. And I'm wondering is that because of what's happening with COVID and there's an increased demand for banks wanting to outsource or is there another reason that that's making you add these conversion teams? David B. Foss: The biggest thing, when we refer -- and I refer to it specifically as convert/merge revenue, the biggest driver of that is Jack Henry financial institutions acquiring other financial institutions. And coming to us and saying, Hey, we just acquired this bank, we need you guys to help us convert them on to the Jack Henry platform [ph]. That's the driver. And we have conversion teams that do new. Of course, we're winning all these new logos to Jack Henry as new banks and credit unions. But those conversion teams, they run pretty steady. We're doing 12, 15 new customers a quarter, and I report on that very regularly. That runs pretty steady. So pretty much everything I was referring to there is being driven by Jack Henry customers, who are acquiring other customers and needing help, converting them over to our systems. And as I mentioned, we did a banking team already. The credit union -- the next credit union team additional team goes into effect here in this -- I guess the quarter we're sitting in right now. And then we're evaluating, possibly adding two more teams because there is so much demand among Jack Henry customers looking to add customers on to our platforms. Kevin D. Williams: And just a reminder, Kartik, to convert a new customer or a new logo, it takes an enormous amount of time than a convert/merge as Dave said to convert a bank that is being acquired on to existing core customer because they've already got basically the system in place that they need. Kartik Mehta : Got it. Thank you both very much, appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Ian Swanstrom with [indiscernible]. Your line is open. Kevin D. Williams: We're not hearing anything, Olivia. Operator : Please check your mute button. Would you like me to go to the next person? Kevin D. Williams: Yes. Operator : Our next person in queue coming from the line of Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Dominick Gabriele : Hey, great. Thanks so much for all the detail on the new strategy. Are you -- I just want to make sure I understand perhaps correctly, are you creating a banking product marketplace where perhaps even an executive, let's say, can sit in front of the computer, open up the Jack Henry software and say, download quickly self-onboard whatever product they decide? And I guess is that part of like the enticement here for them, is that they could -- the rapid kind of onboarding they can have for almost any Jack Henry or third-party product? David B. Foss: Yes, I get where you're going, Dominick. That is not what we're announcing. We're announcing this is a much bigger platform than what you just alluded to. So this is essentially all banking functions that we -- that people think of today as being in the core system and in the associated complementary systems. All of those systems being available over the long term. Again, this isn't a product announcement, it's not available tomorrow. This is a strategy, but all services that you think of in a core system and the related complementary solutions, all living on a single platform on the public cloud available through Jack Henry, whether those technology solutions come directly from Jack Henry or if it's a fintech solution that the bank or credit union decides to work with. Now implied in all of that, in the end, will there be an option for a marketplace, absolutely. That will be implied in the end, but that is not what we're talking about here at the starting point. And this is all about building this platform and all of this ability to support something like that, and then the marketplace is implied once you get to that point. Dominick Gabriele : Great. Great. And then I guess when you just think about the functionality of the end user and what this provides them that's perhaps even better than the strong functionality you provide today, is it -- what are the keys that they're going to see once this is complete on their end, is it speed, is it optionality of products, is it ease of use of among their end users or cost saves, some competitive edge, any color there of what they tangibly see once they put all this stuff, everything to use? Thanks. David B. Foss: Yes. And I think I'll discuss this with two different audiences in mind. So one is our customer, which is the bank or credit union. The other is their customer, which is the consumer or small business. So let me first start with our customer. One of the key advantages in a strategy like this is around the topic of security. So I highlighted the financial data exchanges and the fact that we have relationships today with the four primary financial data exchanges. What that does for the bank or credit union is it eliminates the need for screen scraping, highly insecure, brittle process that's been around for many years. I've been in this industry for 36 years, and I think people were screen scraping when I first started in the industry. So that's been in the industry for a long time. Most players in the industry use screen scraping. We are dead set on eliminating screen scraping for all of our customers. So security and secure exchange of data between financial institutions and Fintechs that is one of the keys here. So the fintech or the -- our financial institution, our customer benefits by added security. Speed, scalability, all the things that you think about when you think about running solutions on the public cloud, all of those things certainly are part of this advantage for the Jack Henry customer. But maybe one of the biggest advantages is for the Jack Henry clients and the bank or credit union is the idea that they can now customize more directly what it is that they're offering to their customers. They can define market niches that they want to go after, and they can use Jack Henry technology or third-party technology on the same platform, in the same presentation to the end user, the end customer, because it's all being run on the same platform. That's a big opportunity for our customers to take advantage of this disruption that's happening in the industry and turn it into opportunity by targeting segments that they want to target. And now when we flip it over to the end consumer or the small business, what do they experience, I think the best way I can articulate this is, think about -- forget about a bank's website.  Think about the digital presentation that you use when you go to your bank's mobile banking application what if in the application, not only could you see all the stuff that the bank has for you, whoever you bank with, but you could also see your crypto balance. Not that the bank is holding your crypto balance on their balance sheet, but you can see that right in the same app. I'm not talking about closing the app and opening another app on your iPhone. I'm saying in the same app, you can see your crypto balance. You can see all the banking information that you have from your bank. You can see your retirement account that you have with Prudential, all of those things presented in the same experience to the consumer through that same application. That's where the strategy gets us. That's where we're headed by creating this platform that supports all of this interconnectivity and this secure exchange of financial data between applications. That's one of the key, and I could go on and on and on and give you all kinds of examples, but that's one that I think most people can relate to. Wouldn't it be cool if I could look at -- open my digital banking app with my bank and in that, I would not only see my balances with my bank, but all my other stuff that I have with all these other providers all through the same presentation. That's where we'll get. Dominick Gabriele : That\u2019s so exciting and great quarter. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Kenneth Suchoski : Hi good morning David and Kevin. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate the update on the long-term strategy. I just wanted to ask about your cloud native digital first offering. And I was wondering if you can give us a sense for how your offering compares to peers because we see FIS talk about its modern banking platform. We saw Fiserv announced this week the acquisition of Finxact. So are there areas where you think your offering is superior versus those providers and are there areas where maybe you need to catch up to bring your offering up to par with theirs, it would just be great to get your thoughts on kind of where you're differentiated? David B. Foss: Yes. So Ken, I'm not in the business on an earnings call going into describing what our competitors are offering. The thing that I will say is we know those solutions very well. We have been investigating for years. This is -- again, this is what we do. Delivering technology solutions to banks and credit unions is all we do. And so we know what our competitors are doing. I have every confidence that the technology solution that Jack Henry is delivering here, what I've just talked about, is a completely differentiated solution. And just in part because it is not a core solution, right? Both of the examples you gave are core solutions. This is unbundling the core. This is redefining what we think about as core. There is no independence. The other thing that I'll highlight, no dependence on the legacy database with what we're talking about here. There is no requirement that you have a legacy database underneath the core solution and what we're talking about here. So it's a totally differentiated strategy from the others that you named. So we feel very confident in what we've created here and our ability to kind of disrupt the market. But again, this isn't something that we're rolling out next week. This is a strategy discussion. This is a long term where is our company going and how are we going to differentiate for the long-term against anybody else in the market. Kevin D. Williams: But as Dave said earlier, the platform is in place or in this example, the chassis to the vehicles in place. And so now, as Dave mentioned, we've already got some solutions out in beta. That's not the core, but it's pieces and parts of the core that's already on the platform beta that will be rolled out later this summer in general availability. Kenneth Suchoski : Okay. Great. That's really helpful. I like the car analogy it's really helpful to dumb it down for all of us. I think -- I guess the next question for me is it's interesting that you're talking about unbundling these solutions, allowing clients to embed fintechs of their choice into these offerings. And so it seems like they're not tied into any legacy products, you're unbundling those functions. I mean how comfortable are you that that's not going to create a revenue headwind going forward just because maybe these customers aren't locked into your offering as much as they were before? Or do you feel like you're pretty open today? David B. Foss: Well, I feel like we're pretty open today. This is a question that we've had -- why does Jack Henry continue to support this idea of open connectivity and creating these connections without charging $100,000 just for somebody to connect into Jack Henry solutions. And the answer is, we -- our philosophy has been and continues to be. Our job is to help make our customers successful. And if we are truly committed to making them successful, we try to make all that stuff easy and make it relatively inexpensive. And our customers, that's part of the reason they do business with Jack Henry, because they know that we will offer that connectivity. This isn't something new. This isn't a new philosophy for us. This has always been the way it's been at Jack Henry. And so it's counterintuitive to most people. Why don't you try and create as many barriers as you can to people doing business with others in the space? Why do you make it so easy to connect into your systems? I think it's because we make it easy that people want to do business with Jack Henry, and they want to buy more solutions from us because we create those options for them. And again, our job is to help our customers be successful, and we are truly committed to that, and this is just the continued extension of that philosophy. Kenneth Suchoski : That's really helpful, David. And then maybe if I could just sneak one last one here. I think you mentioned that you've been working on this strategy for the last couple of years, and that this is a long-term strategy. Does this increase the CAPEX requirements or the operating expense requirements at all going forward to really build this out or do you still feel comfortable with the 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion in 2023 and beyond? David B. Foss: Yes. Everything that we've guided, so my comments and my commentary there, the 14% of revenue that we're putting back into R&D, that is a number we've been telegraphing to you all for years now. We are sticking with that number. And all the guidance that Kevin has provided, all of that is baked into the numbers that we've provided. And the key point there is 14% on a rising revenue, essentially, that's creating about $20 million a year in additional money for us to invest in R&D. So that doesn't require us to do any slowdown on any of the great work our teams do to support our existing cores in our existing complementary solutions. All of that continues as it has been. But just because we're sticking with 14% on a rising revenue number, that creates this additional -- these additional dollars for us to put against this critical R&D initiative for our company. So no need for us to accelerate on CAPEX, no need for us to take a hit to earnings or anything like that, but we can continue to execute on this wonderful strategy. And by the way, so I want to be clear with everybody, we've been working on the strategy for several years. We've had developers coding for two to two and half years. But this strategy has been developed for a long time. So I want to be clear that we didn't just start on this two and half years ago, started thinking about this -- we've been thinking about this for a long time. We actually had coders starting to write code about two or two and half years ago. Kevin D. Williams: And in that 14%, the team that is focused on this new strategy has been growing and in place. We have not taken developers from any of our other products, and we won't because we have to keep those other products continue to increase their feature functionality. So it's not going to take away from any of our existing development. It's just this long-term strategy that's been put in place over the last few years. Kenneth Suchoski : Okay, got it. Makes a lot of sense. Thank you very much, look forward to following the progress. Operator : I am showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Kevin Williams. Kevin D. Williams: Thank you. We are obviously very pleased with the results from our ongoing operations and extremely excited for the future with the new strategy that they rolled out. I want to thank all of our associates for the way they have handled the challenges that we are currently endeavoring by taking care of themselves and our customers and continue to work hard to improve our company to continue moving forward for the future. All of us at Jack Henry continue to focus on what is best for our customers and shareholders. I want to thank you again for joining us today. And Olivia, will you please provide the replay number? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, today's replay number is 1-800-585-8367, again it is 1-800-585-8367, entering access code 9874774. Again, the replay access code is 9874774. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Please go ahead. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry & Associates Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer. And on the call with me today is David Foss, Board Chair and CEO.  In just a minute, I will turn the call over to Dave, so he can provide some of his thoughts about the state of our business, financial and sales performance for the quarter, some comments regarding the industry in general and some other key initiatives that we have in place. Then after Dave concludes his comments, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market close and also provide comments regarding our updated guidance for the remainder of our fiscal year 2022. We will then open the call -- open the lines up for Q&A.  First, I need to remind you that this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements.  Also on this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found in yesterday's press release.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to report another quarter of revenue and operating income growth and an overall solid performance by our business. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our third fiscal quarter.  For Q3 of fiscal 2022, total revenue increased 10% for the quarter and increased 7% on a non-GAAP basis. As projected on our last call, deconversion fees were up more than $13 million over the prior year quarter. Turning to the segments. We again had a good quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased 12% for the quarter and increased by 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment performed very well, posting a 10% increase in revenue this quarter and a 9% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with a 10% increase in revenue this quarter and a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis. As I mentioned in the press release, our core sales teams again had an extremely solid quarter and we continue to see core activity consistent with our pre-pandemic run rate. During the quarter, we inked 14 competitive core takeaways, so we continue at the approximately 1 deal per week run rate I've discussed on recent calls. In addition to our success signing new core clients, we signed 9 existing on-prem core customers to move to our private cloud environment.  In addition to the tremendous success we experienced in our core business this quarter, we continued to sign new clients to our digital banking suite. During the third quarter, we signed 38 new clients to our Banno platform, and we continue to see increased interest in this offering as well as the rest of our digital suite. On our last quarterly call, I mentioned that the sales team set an all-time sales booking record in our fiscal Q2. Although we didn't break that record in Q3, we did set a record for the strongest Q3 in history with sales bookings coming in almost 40% higher than the same quarter last year. This extraordinary sales performance in a quarter that is normally lighter than others is reflective of the interest in our company and demand for Jack Henry technology solutions in our market.  Regarding our Banno Digital suite, as of March 31, we have just over 7.1 million users live on the Banno Platform. We continue to enjoy the highest consumer rating in the App Store, and we are regularly recognized as the fastest application in the industry. As I've said before, I expect our success in this area to grow as we continue to add new functionality and features to the platform.  On our last quarterly call, I shared an announcement regarding our technology modernization strategy and how we believe it will help position our clients for greater success in the future. As many of you know, that announcement has been received very positively by many experts in our industry, and our strategy has been highlighted in a wide variety of publications. Several pieces are still in production, but so far, we've been interviewed for close to 40 different articles, podcast interviews and video podcasts for publications with a combined subscriber base of more than 53 million people.  Hopefully, you've all seen the new corporate sustainability report that we published on March 31. I think it's an excellent representation of the key initiatives and accomplishments we've been working on since we published our last report more than a year ago. In this new report, we provided more detail on the demographic makeup of our workforce, a summary of our employee engagement survey results, more information about our data privacy and cybersecurity practices and a significantly enhanced update on climate-related risks.  This year's report also includes an appendix with detailed disclosures aligned with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB, and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure, or TCFD. We continue to make great strides in the key areas of ESG and are committed to providing more detailed information about our progress over time.  Although you regularly see Jack Henry recognized as the best place to work in various contests around the country, we received 2 new designations last quarter that recognize us as a company that isn't simply an outstanding employer. Inc. Magazine recognized us as one of America's best led companies and Newsweek recognized us as one of America's most responsible companies. Both awards are great recognition for our ongoing commitment to do the right thing for all of our Jack Henry stakeholders.  As we announced a few months ago, Ted Bilke will be retiring at the end of June after 17 years with our company. Ted ran the Symitar division for many years but shifted to become our Chief Technology Officer a few years ago to help us define and finalize our technology modernization strategy. Our modernization strategy benefited significantly from Ted's years of experience speaking directly with our customers about their technology wants and needs. I'd like to thank Ted for his many years of leadership and for helping us to drive consistent success for our customers and shareholders.  As you are also aware, we've been working to find a new CFO so Kevin can enjoy a much deserved retirement. That process has been slower than I had hoped, but we expect to name a new CFO in the near future. Kevin has graciously agreed to stay with us until we're ready to make the transition, so we still have no formal departure date for him. Today, however, we're announcing that Renee Swearingen has been named Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for Jack Henry. Renee has been with the company for more than 25 years and is a key leader on our management team. You'll see a press release with this announcement later today, but I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Renee and thank her for her partnership for these many years.  As we look forward to the end of our fiscal year, our sales pipeline is very strong, and we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our customers, our ability to expand our customer relationships, the spending environment and our long-term prospects for success. I look forward to seeing and chatting with many of you at our Investor Day in Dallas next Monday. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Dave. Our service and support revenue increased 11% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the same quarter a year ago. As Dave mentioned, our deconversion revenue was up $13.1 million for the quarter compared to last year's quarter. License, hardware and implementation revenue combined were essentially flat compared to the prior year and our data processing hosting fees in our private and public cloud offerings, which continue to show strong growth in the quarter compared to previous year, growing by 11% for the quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, total support and services revenue grew 6% for the quarter compared to the prior year. And just a reminder, that non-GAAP -- essentially the only difference is backing out the deconversion revenue that was recognized in the quarter.  Our processing revenue increased 9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the same quarter last year on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The increase is primarily driven by higher card volumes and digital revenue continues to show strong growth as demand for our Banno Digital Platform continues to be very strong.  Total revenue was up 10% for the quarter compared to last year on a reported GAAP basis and increased 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Cost of revenue was up 5% compared to last year's third quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with customer maintenance and license costs, card and transaction processing increased in line with the related revenue growth and also higher personnel costs compared to a year ago.  Research and development expense increased 12% for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to last year. The increase is primarily due to increased personnel costs this year compared to last.  And SG&A expense increased 13% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter of last year. Again, this increase was due primarily to increased personnel costs and also increased travel-related costs compared to the prior year.  Our reported consolidated operating margins increased from 21% last year to 23.3% in the current year quarter for a 220 bp increase. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating margins expanded from 20.3% last year to 20.9% this year for a 60 bps expansion. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 increased to 23.6% compared to 21.5% in the same quarter a year ago, which is in line with the guidance we've provided for the year.  Net income grew 19% to $84.7 million for the third fiscal quarter compared to $71.4 million last year with earnings per share of $1.16 for the current quarter compared to $0.95 last year, for a $0.21 or a 22% increase over the previous year quarter. Some comments on cash flow. Our total amortization increased 2.6% for the year-to-date compared to last year due to capitalized software projects being placed in service. Included in total amortization is amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to $12.4 million this year-to-date compared to $13.3 million last year's first 3 quarters of the fiscal year. Depreciation actually decreased 3.7% compared to the first 9 months of the prior fiscal year.  Operating cash flow was $301.4 million for the year-to-date, which is up from $266.3 million last year, which this is primarily due to increased net income during the first 9 months compared to the previous year and the timing and change of various operating assets and liabilities considered in the calculation of operating cash flow. We invested $145.1 million back into our company through CapEx, purchase and capitalized software.  Our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software and then adding back net proceeds from disposal of assets was $156.4 million for the first 9 months of the fiscal year.  Also during the first 9 months, we spent $193.9 million to purchase 1.25 million shares for the treasury, none in the current quarter, and we paid dividends of $103.4 million for a total return to shareholders of $297.3 million in the first 9 months of fiscal 2022.  A couple of comments on our balance sheet. As of June 30, our cash position was $39.8 million compared to $70.1 million a year ago. Our revolver balance was $225 million compared to $200 million a year ago, which the change in cash and our debt balance is primarily related to the 4.1 million shares we've purchased in the last 24 months. Our return on average assets for the trailing 12 months was 16%, our return on average equity for the trailing months was 27.2% and our return on invested capital for the trailing 12 months was 23.4%, all very solid returns.  For updated guidance, in the press release yesterday, we provided both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance. We also provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP revenue in the release following the segment information. However, just to be clear, this guidance continues to assume that the country continues to open and the economy continues to improve. For GAAP revenue growth for fiscal '22 based on the amounts in the release yesterday, our revenue guidance continues to reflect a little higher than 10% growth over fiscal '21, which we still anticipate deconversion revenue to be approximately $49 million to $50 million for the entire fiscal year. And as we thought, some of the Q4 actually pulled into Q3 so we are not anticipating very much deconversion revenue in Q4.  For non-GAAP revenue growth, we continue to guide to be just under 9% growth for the fiscal year.  We continue to anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins to improve a little in FY '22 compared to last year. But again, I continue to be somewhat cautious on guiding too much of a non-GAAP operating margin expansion as we continue to have headwinds on license and hardware revenue as we continue to move more core customers from on-premise to our private cloud. Also, our travel costs continued to increase significantly compared to the prior year. However, we are still comfortable that full year non-GAAP operating margins will expand approximately 50 bps or higher but also a reminder, the highest margin quarter is our Q1 due to software subscriptions in that quarter.  Our effective tax rate for the year continues to be projected to be slightly higher than 23% compared to the prior year rate. And our updated FY '22 GAAP EPS guidance is now a range of $4.80 to $4.85, which is an increase from the previous guidance of $4.75 to $4.80 a share.  That concludes our opening comments, and we are now ready to take questions. Tom, will you please open the call lines up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Rayna Kumar with UBS. Rayna Kumar : Good morning, David and Kevin. Your guidance to adjusted revenue growth will accelerate in fourth quarter versus the third quarter against more difficult comps. What gives you confidence that revenue growth is going to accelerate from here? Kevin Williams : Well, Rayna, I mean as Dave mentioned, our sales continues to be very strong. Our pipeline is strong. And all of our primary drivers continue to hit on all cylinders, which is primarily our private cloud. We continue to have good movement of our on-prem customers' private cloud, our card and remittance and digital businesses all continue to grow extremely well. And so yes, we're very comfortable that we're going to have a little higher growth in Q4 compared to the previous year. Rayna Kumar : Got it. And then can we have some early thoughts on FY '23 in terms of what you're seeing out there on demand and pricing and how that translates to revenue and margin opportunity? Kevin Williams : Yes. So I mean, as far as the demand, I mean, Dave mentioned several times over his comments that we continue to see a very, very robust demand for our products in the sales organization with record sales in just about every quarter, for the last 3 quarters. So we look to be very good.  Pricing, I mean, obviously, this is a very mature market. I don't see much change in pricing, Rayna. And obviously, we're very early in our budget process for next year. But I'd just go out on a limb and say, I see no reason why we can't continue to grow top line, non-GAAP revenue in that 8.5% to 9% similar to this year for FY '23 and also get some leverage to the operating margin line on a non-GAAP basis of at least 50 bps or so. So I think FY '23, forget about the deconversion revenue because again, we can't predict that. But I think FY '23 is probably going to look a lot like FY '22. Rayna Kumar : Got it. That's very helpful. And if I can sneak one final question in here. What are the key milestones we should be looking out for as you progress in your technology modernization strategy in the near term? David Foss : Yes. Rayna, it's Dave. So we'll have releases this summer. So as I mentioned on the call last time, we have customers in beta right now. And so this summer, we'll announce customers going live, they'll come out of beta, they'll go live with the first module. So sometime this summer, I don't have an exact date to give you. But sometime this summer, you'll hear me talk about customers going live with the first modules on the new platform later this year, and we'll talk about this at the Investor Day on Monday. But later this year, we'll provide road map to our customers and to you all so you can kind of track our progress more specifically as far as things that we're planning to roll out. But I think the first indicator for you will be this summer when we talk about customers going live with the first modules in the tech modernization strategy. Operator : The next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Dave, I think both you and Kevin have talked about the strong demand environment and how well Jack Henry is doing. I'm wondering, are you running any capacity issues? I think, Kevin, you talked about maybe 8.5% to 9% in FY '23. If the demand continues, could you -- could revenue grow faster? Or are you at a point where now you have to push people out further? David Foss : Yes. Well, so I would say neither. So is revenue going to grow faster, it might grow just a little bit faster. The thing you always have to keep in mind is almost everything we signed today is a hosted contracts. So it's a long-term commitment where we're layering revenue in as opposed to something that gives us a revenue pop in the quarter. And that just continues to be true. So almost all of the sales success are with contracts that are long-term commitments layered in over time.  But the -- as I mentioned a couple of calls ago, I think, we have -- we were facing capacity issues as far as doing core conversions. And so we stood up another team on the banking side of our business. So a few months ago, we did another team on the credit union side. Now we've done another one on the banking side. So we are slowly but surely adding teams to make sure that our backlog doesn't get stretched out with any of our product lines.  And so we're having good success in adding capacity as we need to add capacity so our customers don't get frustrated that they're looking at a year or 2 before they can go through a conversion. But it's a constant process of measuring what do we have in the backlog, what's customer expectation, what's coming from the sales pipe. And as I just mentioned, we've set an all-time sales record in Q2. Q3, normally a lighter sales quarter, 40% higher bookings than last year's Q3 and more than any other Q3 in history. And so there is a great deal of demand, but we're -- our teams are doing well, I think, in managing the implementation side of that equation and making sure that we get these contracts into production at a reasonable rate. Kartik Mehta : Kevin, you gave a little bit of a look into FY '23. You talked about maybe margins up around 50 basis points. And I'm wondering from an inflation standpoint, how much that might -- the margins are maybe being held back by some of the costs that you're having to assume because of inflation? Or are you able to push prices enough that the offset is negligible? Kevin Williams : Yes, the offset is pretty negligible, Kartik. So I mean, yes, I mean there's some inflation impact primarily in personnel costs and especially in different areas and pockets within the company that we're going to be facing. I mean, obviously, if it wasn't for that and inflation, I'd probably predict that we could get more expansion than that. So there is some headwinds on the margin from those things, but at this point, and again, we're very early in the budget process, but I think we're pretty comfortable that we can get that margin expansion even in lieu of the inflation and everything else that's going on in the world today. Operator : The next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Dave, could you give a little more detail on the new bookings? You called out 38 new Banno platform signings. I didn't hear you call out new core wins in the quarter. David Foss : Yes, it was 14. So yes, I definitely called it out, 14 new core wins in the quarter. And I think 3 them were multibillion-dollar banks, if I remember correctly, but 14. So as I said in my opening statement, we are absolutely continuing on this run rate of 1 a week. Again, it's lumpy, but continuing to see great success. And as I sit here well into the fourth fiscal quarter, I can tell you that has not slowed down since the end of March. David Togut : Got it. And Kevin, maybe you could just give a little more detail on the preliminary FY '23 guide. You called out an initial view of 8.5% to 9% non-GAAP revenue growth. Approximately, how might that break down at the segment level? Kevin Williams : At the segment level, that's a good question. Obviously, our payment segment is going to continue to be the strongest grower. So payment segment is probably still going to be -- which our payment segment is now, David, 38% of our total revenue, and it's probably going to grow. Again, we're still early in the budget process, but I'm going to guess it's going to grow 9% to 10% and core and complementary will both be in there at 7% to 8.5% right behind it. David Togut : Got it. Just a quick final question. Could you unpack kind of the 3 major subsegments within payments, bill pay, card and enterprise payments in terms of their growth in the March quarter? And how would you see them trending going forward? Kevin Williams : Well, the strongest grower and has been for quite some time is our EPS line of business. And I don't see that slowing as we continue to add merchants. Even though the number of checks per merchant continues to decrease slightly, we continue to add more than enough merchants each quarter to continue to have that very strong growth in the mid-teens.  Right behind that is card. Now that we're a year past the migration of the new platform, we're adding a lot of new customers, both debit and full service credit. So that's going to continue to grow in the high single to low double digits. And then the slowest grower is online bill pay. I mean it's -- we've pretty much saturated the market. We've got 3,500 FIs on our online bill pay. So it's growing, but low single digits. I don't see any of those changing in FY '23, Dave. Operator : The next question comes from Vasu Govil with KBW. Vasundhara Govil : I guess first question, just the complementary segment growth. I thought it was a little bit lighter versus what we were expecting on a non-GAAP basis, a deceleration from last quarter. Just anything -- any call-outs on what products might have been a little bit weaker. I sort of got the comments on Banno still being pretty strong, but any other commentary on the other product suites and what you're expecting for the fourth quarter? Kevin Williams : I don't know that there was anything significant that I would call out that impacted. It's more just a matter of timing of different revenue coming in, but there's no specific products or services that I would call out that was a drag. Vasundhara Govil : Understood. And then on the sales booking, 40% growth, very impressive number. I got the comments on sort of the core and Banno wins. Any other areas sort of the composition of like where all the strength is coming from besides those two areas? David Foss : No, Vasu, it's across the board. So Kevin highlighted that our EPS, Enterprise Payment Solutions business is growing nicely. We're signing a lot of contracts in that area. And I don't normally highlight it on this call, but that's one that was a little bit larger than the normal run rate this quarter. We had good success with our debit, signing new customers coming to our debit platform. Credit, we're continuing to add customers. It was just across the board, just a really solid performance from the sales team this quarter. Vasundhara Govil : Understood. If I could sneak in a last one for you, Dave. It seems like the Director of CFPB made some comments to the banking industry recently about not enough competition in the industry, anticompetitive contracting practices. Just sort of any comments from you on how you would respond to that? David Foss : Yes. So it's interesting, and I certainly have read through the script of the Director's comments and other follow-on presentations by other people in the CFPB. We're highly regulated at Jack Henry. And so we deal with the regulatory bodies regularly. CFPB has also been engaged with us as they've engaged with all the other players in our space. The challenge that we have sometimes, I think, is that we get lumped in with everybody else. Jack Henry gets lumped in with everybody else as far as business practices. And I think Jack Henry has distinguished ourselves for years as doing business differently, very bank and credit union friendly, I think, in our approach.  And so I think if and when there is more request from the CFPB for us to be engaged with them, I think they will learn more about how Jack Henry does business and how it's different.  I'll say that we've been through this with ABA, for example, ABA, at one point was kind of lumping Jack Henry and with everybody else and saying, Jack Henry does things the same way. And then once we really got into those detailed discussions with the ABA committees, they realized and stated that we now recognize Jack Henry is doing things differently and is much more kind of supporting the community and regional financial institution environment with our business practices. So we're prepared if there is something that comes -- some requests that come of us to engage more directly. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Peter Heckmann : I'm wondering, as you work with the Fed on the upcoming FedNow release, do you have any updated thoughts on real-time payments and maybe perhaps some of the first use cases that we'll see in the U.S. and how you think if that could change parts of your business? I know Jack Henry has been very innovative and kind of forward thinking in terms of real-time payments. But I'd be curious to see if you think that's going to be a big splash or a very gradual increase in volumes. David Foss : Yes. It's a good question, Pete. It's one that we've continued to talk around about around here. In fact, I just talked the Fed governor from Kansas City is responsible for the FedNow program. And I talked to her just a month ago or so about the program and the status and are they going to hit their dates. And right now, they're mid-2023 -- calendar '23 for a release date. And right now, they're still on track to hit that release date, and we hope that happens.  With respect to real-time payments just in general, I want to emphasize again, Jack Henry today, more than 60% of the financial institutions in the U.S. who use the real-time payments network through the clearinghouse, so more than 60%, are Jack Henry customers. They're doing that through Jack Henry. So we are the dominant player today in real-time payments as far as number of financial institutions that are using the RTP network through the clearinghouse.  So we're very, very involved in RTP. Our PayCenter solution has been highly adopted. And of course, FedNow is supported in our PayCenter application at Jack Henry.  So when FedNow comes live, we're ready for it, obviously, because we've been working with the Fed for a long time. The pace of adoption is -- that's going to be interesting to see that -- When Zelle first rolled out, the thing that I said back years ago was as long as Zelle is kind of the really easy, fun-to-use application, it poses a real threat to Venmo. Well, it wasn't the easy, fun-to-use application, it's kind of a clunky application. But we all support it, those of us in the financial technology space, we support it. But it was never any real threat to Venmo because it's kind of a clunky application as far as I'm concerned.  Okay, what happens with FedNow? Is it going to be really user-friendly and kind of easy for people to adopt or not, we'll see. I think most banks and credit unions are planning to adopt and support FedNow. I hope it's a really easy-to-use application, and it will receive wide adoption because I think that will be good for us. We have a number of use cases that we've built out that we think will be really good for banks and credit unions to adopt, but it's got to be something that people want to use. You can't force them to use it. Peter Heckmann : Definitely. And then any early thoughts on just kind of the revenue model or how the pricing of FedNow might compete -- compare to other existing real-time networks in the U.S. or same-day ACH? David Foss : Yes. There's a lot of discussion on that topic right now. So I'm not going to predict publicly where that's going to end up because that's a real key to this whole equation is how does the Fed end up pricing and how competitive do they want to be as compared to other offerings out there. So I don't know where that's all going to end up, but that is a big topic of discussion right now. Peter Heckmann : All right, we'll stay tuned. Appreciate it. David Foss : Yes. You bet. Operator : The next question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Have you heard about rising tech talent costs putting an accelerant on your services for companies to outsource their core or other processes to the cloud? Is there an area of the business where rising wages would put a particular set of products in higher demand? And then I just have a follow-up. David Foss : Yes. It's an interesting question, Dominick. In fact, it's something that I was just talking about this week with a couple of our customers and with -- internally with our team. So it's less about rising costs and more about banks and credit unions challenged to find the talent that they need.  So we all know the great resignation. We all talk about it that most companies are experiencing higher turnover than they normally experience and in a lot of cases, it's hard to find the talent you need. And banks and credit unions are experiencing the same thing. And so that is certainly creating some demand to come to companies like Jack Henry to provide services that we've done for a long time.  The interesting thing that's happening now is there are also more requests for us to provide more kind of back-office assistance, back-office guidance because they have lost talent in the back office for the bank or credit union. And that -- I can't decide if that's a blip or if it's a long-term opportunity that's going to create opportunities for us to sell more technology, more workflow technology as an example. You can use workflow technology when you don't have the people to do the manual work.  So we're trying to figure out if that's a short-term opportunity or a long-term opportunity. We don't really want to be in the business of being a consultant to body shop as far as consulting. We certainly do a lot of that, but that's not our core competency. We're a technology provider.  So we're trying to weigh all that and kind of figure out where is the opportunity and is it a short-term opportunity or a long-term opportunity. But it's certainly a topic. Dominick Gabriele : Great, great. And then maybe just one more. Given the strong demand for your products and given the sales growth, do you think we're seeing not only just really strong execution given the strategy shift and the demand for your current products but also perhaps an accelerating overall banking and credit union industry tech demand for software leaving the pandemic on top of that? So we could see even higher than 9% revenue growth maybe in core. David Foss : So I think we have built in -- so first of, on Monday at the Investor Day, I'm going to share with you some charts specific to industry projections. And I tend on these calls to share as surveys come out. I try to share with you all what we're hearing about demand in the industry generally. And so I'm going to give you some more information about that on Monday at the Investor Day.  But yes, definitely, the spending is up and the overall in the industry. Jack Henry is clearly a beneficiary of that, but that is baked into all the comments that Kevin made earlier about what we're looking at for FY '23, what we're experiencing today and what we're looking at for FY '23.  So that's not new news to us. We really started to see that being telegraphed to us with those first surveys that came out last September, I think, if I remember correctly. And everything we've seen since then has supported that idea. So we've baked that into everything that we're working on right now as far as budgets for FY '23. Dominick Gabriele : Great. Excellent execution this quarter. David Foss : Thank you, Dominick. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. David Koning : Great job. And maybe if I could kick it off on the payment segment. David Togut kind of asked about the breakdown. But debit, I think, decelerated in general across the industry. So no surprise that you did a little bit. But what's kind of interesting, last year, yours accelerated a ton in Q4. And I actually don't know if that creates a tough comp for Q4 this year or if that was just a normalization, you could actually still grow 9%, 10% Q4 of this year. I just want to kind of understand that. Kevin Williams : Well, a couple of things, Dave. So last year was a little more rapid growth coming out of COVID compared to the previous year. Because remember, the previous year, our Q4 was very weak, just like everybody else in the industry. So it is a little tougher comp. But with the backlog of sales that we're having, I still feel we're going to have some really solid growth in all of our lines of payments in Q4 compared to last year, even with a little tougher comps. David Koning : Yes. That's what it looked like. No, that's great. And then secondly, there's a lot of like just comp issues for other companies that have either stimulus benefits or wallets that all kind of tie in with stimulus. You seem to have none of that, but is there actually almost a benefit that you get as we kind of went through this cycle where a lot of people got these wallets and cash app and all this stuff. And maybe come back now and say, okay, that worked for a little bit, but I just want to bank now that you might benefit from some consumer demand that way? David Foss : That's a good question. I don't know -- I don't know that I could say, yes, that's happening or yes, we're going to benefit from that. I believe there is -- there has not been a slowdown in demand or interest in the services from our customers. We don't have customers that have lost a bunch of share or something like that as a result of these people experimenting with new applications or fintech-y type solutions. And so I don't know that I would say, oh, there's some big opportunity here because people will kind of revert back to working -- now that their bank or credit union has cooler technology, they're going to revert back to work primarily with the bank or credit union. I don't know that they stopped working with their bank or credit union.  And remember that we get paid on -- when it comes to our primary businesses, it's on number of customers that we're supporting, number of accounts, number of assets. And of course, there is the transaction volume. But since we're not an acquirer, we're an issuer, we normally are getting that anyway. So I don't think that I would want to hang my hat on that as a big opportunity, but I might be missing something. Operator : The next question comes from John Davis with Raymond James. John Davis : Kevin, I just want to start out on your preliminary outlook for the payments business or segment for next year, the 9% to 10%, and I realize it's really early. So I'm not trying to nail you down on this. But have you contemplated further kind of debit mix normalization in that? And are you guys seeing much of an impact at all from -- it's a little bit of a follow-up to Dave's question. Just credit becoming a bigger part of the mix as we kind of exit the pandemic? Kevin Williams : We have not seen a lot of that, JD, but obviously, the other thing I would say is we are now offering full service credit, which we weren't even offering that a year ago. So even as it moves to credit, we've got that opportunity in front of us now. So I mean, I think we're going to see some shift from debit to credit. But so far, we've not seen much of an impact on our business. John Davis : Okay. And then, Dave, maybe switching to capital allocation for a second. No buybacks in the quarter. You guys have a great currency. Thoughts on M&A as some of these valuations have come in. Should we read into anything with no buybacks this quarter despite, obviously, a very, very healthy balance sheet? Just any comments there would be helpful. David Foss : So I've said in many forums here in the past few months that I'm pretty optimistic about calendar '22 as a year where Jack Henry can get back into the game as far as M&A is concerned. We say all the time that acquisitions are at the top of our list, always, we know that we're a good acquirer. We're a disciplined acquirer. We know how to integrate companies in well.  And so what I've said for the last several months is -- and you have several companies who went public last year and probably technically shouldn't have gone public, and now their valuation has dropped significantly. They have shareholders that are kind of wondering what the future looks like. And so there may be opportunity there.  But I think the greater opportunity is there are a lot of companies in our space, who were on the sidelines who were kind of prepping to go public given the frothiness of the market, and now that has all stopped. And so if you're running a nice little company and you're sitting on the sideline thinking you were going to IPO and now that is not going to happen and you're contemplating a capital raise or find a really nice strategic partner like Jack Henry, I think you would look seriously at talking to Jack Henry. So we are prepared for those opportunities, and I'm very hopeful that we're going to see some of those here this calendar year. John Davis : Okay. And I'm going to squeeze one more in if I can. Just there's been a lot of talk amongst investors around CPI escalators in the industry just broadly. I think most management teams have kind of talked down the impact just given that there's caps. But obviously, with inflation running as hot as it is right now, just curious on how you guys think about CPI inflators or escalators? How material are they? Any color there would be helpful. David Foss : Yes. So we do have CPI escalators and I always say virtually all of our contracts. Keeping in mind, we've acquired a lot of companies here over the last few years and some of those contracts are still in place. I can't say absolutely that every single contract has a CPI escalator opportunity, but virtually all of them have escalators.  We have already -- in several cases, we have deployed those already this year. We have others that are coming up with our annual billings that happen here now and next month, I guess it is or this month. So they are happening.  But the thing I always remind everybody, our business, our customers are bankers, they're banks and credit unions. They understand what's going on in the economy, right? They understand what's reasonable and what's not. And at Jack Henry, we've always taken the position that just because we could do X percent as a CPI accelerator, if that's not a reasonable number, we're not going to go up 2x.  And so we have taken a position that I think is reasonable. It supports the business model that we have. It's also been taken as reasonable by our customers. And so I think it offsets much of what we see happening in the market. But it's the approach that we're going to continue to take. We'll do reasonable escalations using the CPI opportunity where it makes sense. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. Kenneth Suchoski : I want to ask about the fiscal 4Q margin guide. It looks like there's some implied margin pressure next quarter and we are estimating about 150 basis points year-over-year impact from lower deconversion fees, but I was thinking you'd have some margin expansion ex that impact. So maybe you could just -- can you give us your thoughts there on what's impacting the margin? And maybe you could also touch on the CapEx and expense expectations related to the next-gen tech strategy that you guys are pursuing? Kevin Williams : Well, as far as Q4 margins, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect to have some slight margin expansion, probably not what we've seen in the first 3 quarters. But we expect to see some. But you're right, there's going to be -- on a GAAP perspective, with only predicting that we're going to have $1 million or $2 million in deconversion fees compared to last year, there is going to be some margin pressure on a GAAP basis going forward in Q4. But overall, we feel like the margins on it, especially on a non-GAAP basis will still be strong.  I'll let Dave handle the CapEx on the new tech. David Foss : So can you rephrase that part of the question, Ken? Kenneth Suchoski : Yes. I was just wondering what type of CapEx that you guys are penciling in? And then anything on the expense side that you would expense to the P&L that you would have to make just to pursue this next-gen tech strategy? David Foss : So keep in mind, we've been absorbing both the expense line and the CapEx line. We've been absorbing for more than 2.5 years, as I stressed on the last call. So this isn't something new. It's been baked into the P&L. You've -- the numbers have been flowing through the P&L for 2.5 years. We just never called it out as part of the P&L. And so that rate is going to continue essentially at the same rate.  I said on the last call, and I'll say it again, we're committed to 14% of revenue as an R&D investment that includes this technology modernization strategy. If you look back 5 years or so, you'll see us running at roughly 14% of revenue that we're putting back into R&D, and we're going to continue at that rate going forward, including this tech modernization strategy. So you won't see any great big spike in either the cap side of the equation or the P&L impact, direct expense side of the equation because of this strategy. Kevin Williams : And this is very similar to everything we've done for years. This is not a big bang approach. As we get the various components done, like the ones that are in beta right now, those will be rolled out into production and the amortization will begin at that time. So it's not like we're going to wait until the whole thing is done in 10 years and then start expensing the whole thing. They will be rolled out as components go into general availability. Kenneth Suchoski : Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then the bookings were really strong in the quarter. Can you just talk about what's driving that sales success? I mean how much of that is driven by the offering you have in the overall environment versus something you're doing that's unique in your go-to-market strategy? And then maybe you could touch on the full service credit offering that you now have. I mean how are sales progressing there? David Foss : Yes. So it's -- those aren't mutually exclusive. So you asked if it was -- what's going on in the industry or is it something specific that Jack Henry is doing, I would say it's both. The industry, the rising tide raises all boats, and that is definitely happening. The spend environment in our space has increased, has improved in the past year. So Jack Henry is definitely a beneficiary of that.  But I think the product mix that we have, all these new things that we've been rolling out here in the past couple of 3 years, and the announcement, and I alluded to this on the last call, and I'll just say it very specifically. Although we just publicly announced the tech modernization strategy on the last earnings call, we had taken customers under the cover with NDAs for several months. Customers who were thinking about, do I want to do business with Jack Henry? What does your future look like? If we sign with Jack Henry, where are you guys going as far as technology is concerned? We have taken customers under the covers for months before the public announcement. And so I think virtually every one of them that we took under the covers, they said we want to go with you guys because we see the future with Jack Henry.  So I think that is a unique piece. But pretty much everything else is the combination of the improved spending environment and then this recognition that Jack Henry has received broadly for doing a lot of innovative things, rolling out new products and really focusing on taking care of community and regional financial institutions in the United States. The fact that we're not -- we didn't pursue the merchant acquiring business, our customers know that we are focused on them and their success, and that's continuing to drive new opportunities for Jack Henry. Kenneth Suchoski : Absolutely. And maybe I could sneak one more in. Just the free cash flow conversion, I mean, still a little bit below 100% on a trailing 12-month basis, but ticked up a little bit versus last quarter. Can you just provide your expectations on how you expect that to trend into fiscal year '23? Kevin Williams : Well, I think it's going to trend back right at 100%, if not better. I mean, again, Ken, you got to remember, our Q4 and Q1 are our strongest free cash flow quarters because of the annual maintenance billings for all of our on-prem customers, which goes out the 1st of June. So our -- both our operating cash flow and especially free cash flow are the highest in Q4 and Q1.  And so a lot of that, if you look at a year-over-year basis, on a fiscal basis, some of that can depend on when we actually collect those fees from our customers, whether we collect in Q4 or Q1 because it's just a matter of timing on that. But on a trailing 12 months, we should be back up to the close to 100% conversion. Operator : The next question comes from Charles Nabhan. [Operator Instructions]. Charles Nabhan : It's good to see the normalization in core wins over the past couple of quarters. And I know you alluded to a couple of multibillion-dollar banks in that 14 this quarter. But I'm curious, just looking back, would you say that the average size of the bank or credit union that you're winning is larger than it has been over the past couple of years? And secondly, if we think about the systems that those banks or credit unions may be running, could you speak to the nature of the systems that you're displacing within your takeaways? David Foss : Sure, Chuck. And intuitive question on your part, I'll definitely tell you that. So absolutely, the size of institutions that we're winning has gone up, and in some cases, fairly significantly. We just had a -- our sales budget planning meeting was last week for preparing for FY '23.  So financial budgets, we're just starting, but you have to do the sales budget planning before you can do financial budgets. And that was a big topic of conversation with our sales leaders, so that in the past couple of years, the size of institution that we're winning overall has definitely gone up. And like I say, in some cases, fairly significantly. And so -- so that is absolutely true. And then what was the second half of your question, sorry? Or Kevin, do you have it? Chuck, would you repeat that? Charles Nabhan : The types of systems that you're displacing, whether it's first gen, in-house, et cetera? David Foss : Yes. So not -- we're certainly winning some in-house customers away, people who are running in-house on-prem today. But we are winning.  It's interesting. Most of our wins -- if you had asked me this question 2, 3 years ago, most of the wins would have been from competitors who are supporting older systems and their customers were frustrated because they weren't putting enough investment into these older systems.  Today, it's across the board. There are still lots of older systems out there where people are frustrated that they don't think there's enough investment, and we are winning those opportunities. But we're winning the flagship customers. So customers who are running the flagship solution from some of our competitors, we're winning those deals today as well. So it's been an interesting shift, I think, because it used to be really difficult to displace somebody off of a flagship solution from one of our major competitors. And today, that's happening more than it did in the past. Charles Nabhan : I guess as a follow-up, and I would think this is going to be a topic of conversation next week at the Analyst Day, but I wanted to get a little color around your product road map. And I guess, how you think about M&A versus organic product development? And secondly, whether you see -- whether that product road map is mainly focused on augmenting existing solutions or perhaps branching out into an area that you're not currently as deep in? David Foss : Yes. So we -- if you look back at our company 15 years ago, we were doing a lot of M&A to bring innovative technology into the company. So we did -- there was 1 year we did 6 acquisitions in 1 year, all different products. In the past couple of years, it's been almost impossible to get a deal done because the valuations were crazy. And so we've focused heavily on organic development efforts.  But today and just before the pandemic, I think we were really good at doing the build-buy-partner analysis at Jack Henry. So when we see an opportunity, we won through this process. So do we build it ourselves? Is there something we could acquire? Or is there a partnership that makes the most sense for us to pursue. And I think we have a healthy balance of that today. And now with the environment changing a little bit as far as valuations, I think we can really get back into that mode again.  The challenge as far as our -- the good news and the bad news as far as our product portfolio is we don't have many holes in our product portfolio. It's not like we're desperate to go get a solution to fill a hole because customer demand is so strong. We're really pretty complete as far as our product suite. So most of the acquisitions we look at are things that would -- we can connect to something we already have and create that 1 plus 1 equals 3 type scenario for Jack Henry customers. And so we're always looking for those opportunities.  And then as far as the new development, we're creating new solutions regularly. We have a new fraud solution that's under development right now that we'll talk about a little bit on Monday. And that -- those efforts continue as well.  So it's a good healthy mix, I think, for our company today when it comes to what things do we acquire, what do we look at acquiring versus what things should we write ourselves. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the conference back over to Mr. Kevin Williams for any closing remarks. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Tom. Again, as Dave mentioned, we do look forward to hosting many of you on the call next Monday in Dallas at our Annual Investor Day, which is being held at the Hyatt DFW, Dallas Fort Worth Airport, beginning at 1 :00 p.m. with registration beginning about 11 :00 a.m. And again, after the presentations, we will have mini tech fair and show off some of, I think, 5 of our newer hardware products that are out there.  And with that, we are pleased with the results from our ongoing operations, and we are excited for the future. I want to thank all of our associates for the way they have handled these challenges by taking care of themselves and our customers and continue to work hard to improve our company to continue moving forward for the future. All of us at Jack Henry continue to focus on what is best for our customers and shareholders.  I want to thank you again for joining us today. And with that, Tom, will you please provide the replay number? Operator : Yes. The phone number you dial is for United States toll-free 1-877-344-7529 and the United States local toll number being 1-412-317-0088. When prompted to enter a code, please enter 4203516. Again, that replay code is 4203516. Thank you all very much for attending. This conference has now concluded. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning everyone and welcome to the Jack Henry & Associates Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year End 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please also note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Mr. Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Sir, please go ahead. Kevin Williams : Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for the Jack Henry & Associates fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2022 earnings call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer and on the call with me today is David Foss, Board Chair and CEO. In a minute, I'll turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the state of our business, financial and sales performance for the quarter and year, comments regarding the industry in general, and some key initiatives that we have in place. Then after Dave concludes his comments, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market close and provide comments regarding our guidance for fiscal year 2023 which was also provided in the press release. We will then open the lines up for Q&A. First, I need to remind you that this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. On this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found in yesterday's press release. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. Today we are very pleased to share details with you for a quarter there produced record revenue and operating income as well as record sales bookings. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our fourth quarter and for the entire fiscal year. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 total revenue increased 7% for the quarter and increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were down about 37% as compared to the prior year quarter. As a reminder, although a reduction in deconversion fees impacts the quarter negatively, it is a long-term positive for our business. Turning to the segments, we had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 8% for the quarter and increased by 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Our Payments segment performed well, posting a 5% increase in revenue this quarter, and a 5% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a very robust quarter in our complimentary solutions businesses with a 9% increase in revenue this quarter, and a 10% increase on a non-GAAP basis. As I highlighted in our press release, the fourth quarter was the strongest sales quarter in the history of the company. Those of you who follow us closely will know that in the fourth quarter of 2021, we set an all-time sales record. We broke that record in the second quarter of fiscal '22, and now we've broken that new record in the fourth quarter. Additionally, in the third quarter of this year, we exceeded our highest ever Q3 sales attainment by around 40%. All-in-all this has been a remarkable year for the sales teams. To provide a little detail regarding sales successes in the quarter, we booked 17 competitive core takeaways with five of those being multi-billion dollar institutions. Additionally, we signed 18 deals to move existing on-premise customers to our private cloud environment. Several of our complimentary offerings also saw a very strong demand in the quarter with, as you might guess, our digital suite leading the pack. We signed 48 new clients to our Banno digital platform in the quarter and 21 new clients to our card processing solution. For the full year, we signed 52 competitive core takeaways with 10 of them greater than $1 billion in assets. Additionally, we signed 54 contracts to move on-premise core clients to our private cloud, 165 new Banno digital customers, and 58 new clients for our card processing solution. Of course, we signed a variety of other contracts for many of our other solutions as well, but it's important to note that almost all of these contracts represent long-term recurring revenue commitments to Jack Henry for a wide variety of our solutions. Our annual client conference is scheduled for the end of this month and I'm very happy to say we already have 56 core prospects signed up to attend and hopefully finalize their decision to move to Jack Henry. In case you missed that, I'm going to repeat that. At our annual client conference at the end of this month, we have 56 core prospects signed up to attend and work with our sales organization. At our analyst conference in May, I shared with the attendees that we had just surpassed 7.2 million registered users on our Banno Digital Banking platform. As of the end of the fiscal year, we were at roughly 7.7 million registered users. As a point of reference, on July 1, 2020, we had about 3.2 million registered users, so in two years we've seen an increase of almost 150% in our user count. This is significant because as I've stressed in the past, most of the revenue for a business like this is tied to the number of users on the platform. payments-as-a-service: payments-as-a-service: ProfitStars: Our new brand is the outcome of the work we are doing to modernize our technology, streamline operations and operate as one company, which we believe will result in a better client experience. We now have a platform to speak from a single, consistent voice as we continue to help community and regional financial institutions strengthen connections with account holders by offering a full array of solutions and access to a wide network of FinTech partners. As many of you know, Jack Henry is regularly named as the best place to work in various publications around the country. Recently, we were thrilled to be named by LinkedIn as a top-10 best place to work in financial services. Our consistent placement on best place to work lists is a testament to the workplace culture we have at Jack Henry and our employee engagement scores reflect that strong culture. Additionally, we began a continuous listening strategy this year to gather feedback from our associates and I'm pleased to share that overall, our participation rate was greater than 65%. We achieved an engagement capital score of 79% and 87% of our employees say that they believe in Jack Henry's values all well above industry benchmarks. As we shared at the beginning of August, we have now completed a comprehensive search and have named a new CFO effective on September 1. Mimi Carsley joined our finance team on July 1st and has been busy coming up to speed on the Jack Henry story and financials for the past several weeks. As we stated in the press release, she comes to us with more than 30 years of financial industry experience, but also has a strong technology background. Mimi will be traveling with our Director of Investor Relations Vance Sherard in September to meet with a number of investors and analysts and I expect that she will lead this call in November. Of course, with the addition of Mimi, we are now prepared to wish Kevin a happy retirement. Kevin has been very accommodating through the search process by delaying his intended retirement date until he was confident that we have found a replacement who could help us build the company for the future. As many of you know, Kevin has been with Jack Henry for almost 25 years, but his association with our company goes back well over 30 years. During that time, he has had a tremendous impact on our execution and our success. I'd like to take this opportunity on behalf of all Jack Henry associates, customers, and shareholders, to thank Kevin for everything he's done to make us so successful for these many years. You will be missed Kevin. As I reflect back on fiscal 2022, I can confidently say it was a very good year for our company. Our employee engagement scores remain high and our levels of customer engagement and customer satisfaction scores are also very high. We have successfully completed several leadership and board level retirements and replacements and expect these new members of our leadership teams to continue our track record of success. Our sales teams are performing extremely well and have positioned us for another successful year and overall demand for Jack Henry Technology Solutions remains high in all segments of our business. We have a commitment to doing the right thing for our constituents that we believe will continue to serve us well. We will continue with our disciplined approach to running the company and expect that approach to help provide stability for our employees, customers, and shareholders. As we began the new fiscal year, I continued to be very optimistic about our future. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Dave. Our service and support revenue increased 7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to the same quarter year ago. With deconversion revenue being down $3 million in the quarter, compared to last year's quarter, it was slightly higher than what we thought it would be, but still down 37% from a year ago. License, hardware, and implementation revenue combined were actually up $5 million or 12% compared to the prior quarter. Our data processing, hosting fees and our private and public cloud offerings, which continue to show strong growth in the quarter compared to the previous year, growing by 11% for the quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, total support and service revenue grew 8% for the quarter compared to the prior year. Our processing revenue increased 8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to the same quarter last year on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The increase was primarily driven by slightly higher card volumes and digital revenue continues show strong growth as demand for Banno Digital platform continues to be very strong. Total revenue is up 7% for the quarter on a GAAP basis and increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Our cost of revenue was up 4% compared to last year's third quarter. This increased primarily due to higher costs associated with customer maintenance and license costs, card processing and higher personnel costs compared to a year ago. Our research and development expense increased 18% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to the same prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to personnel and consulting costs. And SG&A expense increased 16% in the fourth quarter and this increase was primarily again due to increased personnel costs, which includes commissions and travel related costs compared to last year. Our reported consolidated operating margins were essentially flat at 21.5% on a non-GAAP basis. Our operating margins expanded from 20.1% last year to 20.9% this year for a nice margin expansion on a non-GAAP basis. Effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 increased to 21.8% compared to 19.7% in the same quarter a year ago, primarily due to timing effects of deductions. Our net income grew 5% to $80.4 million for the fourth fiscal quarter compared to $76.9 million last year with earnings per share of $01.10 for the current quarter compared to $01.04 last year. Our cash flow our total amortization increased 2.9% for the year-to-date compared to last year, primarily due to capitalized software projects being placed into service in the prior year. Included in the total amortization is the amortization intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to $16.3 million this year, compared to $17.7 million last year. Depreciation actually decreased 3.2% compared to the prior fiscal year. Our operating cash flow was $504.6 million for the fiscal year, which was up from $462 million last year, was primarily due to increased net income of $51.4 million compared to the previous year. We invested $191.4 million back into our company through CapEx, purchase and capitalized software. Our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software and adding back net proceeds from disposal of assets was actually $313.3 million. This represents 86% conversion of net income. There were two primary working capital items that were responsible for this. Our receivables were up $35 million compared to a year ago. However, a little over a third of this is an increase is due to increased average monthly billings for recurring revenue, which our average monthly billings continues to grow. And then the balance is due primarily to the timing collections, especially our annual maintenance. But I will say that our annual maintenance as of last Friday is right in line with where it was a year ago, so we did catch up ground in July and August. The other item, the working capital item was prepaid expense in other which increased $26 million, which $20 million of this increase is due to prepaid commissions related to the strong contracting that we had in the previous year or in this year, I'm sorry. And in the other, the balance was primarily due to prepaid cost of products. Without the impact of these two working capital items, our free cash flow conversion from net income would have been greater than 100%. During the year we spent $193.9 million to purchase 1.25 million shares for the treasury. We paid dividends of $139.1 million for a total return to shareholders of $333 million in fiscal FY '22. A couple of comments on our balance sheet as of June 30, cash position of $48.8 million compared to $51 million a year ago, pretty much in line. Our revolver balance was up a little to $115 million compared to $100 million a year ago. Our return on average assets for the trailing 12 months is 15.1%. Our return on average equity for the trailing 12 months is 26.9%, and return on invested capital for the trailing 12 months is 24.9%, which we are very proud of those key metrics. For FY '23 guidance we've provided both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance in the press release yesterday for fiscal 2023. We also provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP revenue in the release following the segment information. However, just to be clear, this guidance is based on today's environment and if things were to change significantly, then this guidance will also be revised. Also, just to be clear, this guidance does not include the impact of the recently announced acquisition of Payrailz that is scheduled to close later this month. So there is no financial impact in this guidance from that future potential acquisition. For GAAP revenue growth for fiscal '23, based on the announcement in the release yesterday, our revenue guidance reflects revenue growth of approximately 7.2% over fiscal '22, which this anticipates deconversion revenue will decrease by approximately $18 million from $53 million down to $35 million compared to FY '22. And this is based on what we're seeing on the current activity on the M&A front. For non-GAAP revenue growth our initial guide for FY '23 is approximately $8.4% and 8.5% which is down slightly from the non-GAAP revenue growth we saw in FY '22 of 8.8%, but obviously for many parts of our business, implementation, convert, merge, and even payments, we had a little easier comp in FY '22 compared to FY '21 than we will have in FY '23. So we are very happy to report that we were guiding to close to 8.5% non-GAAP revenue growth. Initial guide for GAAP operating margin for FY '23, it will decrease from 24.4% to approximately 23.7% in '23 and this is primarily due to the anticipated decrease in deconversion revenue, because obviously deconversion revenue has extremely high margins. Our initial guide for non-GAAP operating margin is projected to be essentially flat at approximately 22.7% for FY '23. Some reasons for this projected flat operating margins, because there's been some things that changed since the first week of May when we talked about guidance. E&O: Just for our employees, our last month travel airline tickets on average have increased 58% from February. Hotel rooms on average last month increased 32% since February. And then obviously as we all have noted as increase in both costs of meals and rental cars have gone up. Therefore, even though this guidance is less than the 50% expansion we've talked about in the first week of May, the environment has changed and it continues to change significantly. Obviously we try to be conservative in our guidance. As you all know, I have always lived under the philosophy and the promise and over deliver and hopefully that's what this guidance is going to provide. Our effective tax rate for FY '23 is projected to increase to approximately 23.8%. But some states have gotten a little more aggressive and the benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts other than the decreased federal tax rate have now been fully utilized over the last four years. Our FY '23 GAAP EPS guidance is a range of $5.05 to $5.09. This now concludes our open comments. We are now going to take questions. Jamie, will you please open the call lines up for questions? Operator :  Our first question today comes from Vasundhara Govil from KBW. Please go ahead with your question. Vasundhara Govil : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess first congratulations on another really strong sales quarter. And David, I was sort of interested in learning if, to what extent your tech modernization strategy is sort of contributing to the discussions as you go in to meet with new clients now? David Foss : Yes, good morning, Vasu. So it's a good point. It certainly is a topic, but as I've stressed on prior calls, we're not talking with customers about delivering the tech modernization technology in the next year or so. But I think this has given a lot of prospects, the comfort in knowing that Jack Henry is leading the way as far as a true public cloud, native technology strategy for the future. And so that has definitely created opportunities for us to be engaged with customers, whether or not that's directly contributing to closed deals, I don't know whether I can say that with any comfort, but I just absolutely opened the doors with a lot of prospective customers because they see the future with Jack Henry. Vasundhara Govil : Got it. Thanks for the color. And then Kevin for you, I mean, thanks for all the color on the sort of change in the margin guide. You sort of said at the end that you were still sort of looking to be conservative, so what are the areas where you think your guide might be conservative in terms of margins? And then for revenue growth, any change in trend by a segment that we should expect relative to what we saw last year? Kevin Williams : Yes, so I think if there's concern anywhere, it's probably in our payments area and then obviously in our private cloud. As Dave mentioned, we signed a whole bunch of customers in Q4 to move over from our on-prem to our private cloud. And if we continue to move those over, obviously that is a nice margin lift when we move those customers over. So those would be the two areas, then obviously the continued growth Banno digital because that's also nice margins. Those are probably the three areas that if we're conservative, it's probably in one of those three areas. As far as segments, core should continue to be strong because of the continued, not only movement from on-prem to private cloud, but also just the new customers that we signed in Q4, the backlog that we have in install. So I'm pretty sure that our install backlog is out at least 12 months now for all of our core, well, for our flagship core solutions. And as, as complimentary, I mean, that's going to continue to be driven by Banno digital and also the new fraud solution that we're rolling out and treasury and other things. So there's just a huge demand for a lot of our products out there. And then payments will just continue to grow as we close the deal in August that should help move our bill pay solution a little bit. But our EPS and CPS  are most still showing strong signs of growth. Vasundhara Govil : Great. Thank you for the color. David Foss : You bet. Operator : Rayna Kumar : Rayna Kumar : Good morning. It's actually UBS. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned 56 prospects are attending your conference later this month. I'm just curious to know how that number compares to previous conferences that you've had and if the prospects are using in-house or outsourced core solutions right now and then finally just a potential timeline of conversion? Thank you. David Foss : Sure, thanks Rayna. So it is -- I don't have an exact number for what would be the most we've ever had, but we are all confident. This is a record to have 56 show up and you know, what that, I guess the thing that you can intuit from that is, not all prospects come to our client conference. So that means we have a whole bunch more of core prospects that we're talking to that are not coming to the client conference. The reason I stress that is, these are people who are investing their time to come and spend with us. They're looking at a move to Jack Henry. The other thing that I would correlate there is that normally what I say on these calls is, if we can do 50 to 55 new core customers in a year, that's a really good year. We have 56 that are signed up to come to the client conference to join us there. So a great sign as far as we're concerned. When they sign, I mean, some of them are at the beginning of their process. This is kind of the final step in their due diligence to come and spend a little time with us. So it all depends on when they sign. But as far as core conversions are concerned, still a good measure for a core conversion is to think in terms of nine to 12 months for a core conversion. And that's not because we can't slot them in and we don't have the staff or anything like that, it's because when you do a core conversion and you've used that phrase a lot of times you're doing heart and lung surgery all at the same time on a bank or credit union, and they need time to get ready for that. They have a lot of prep work to do, a lot of training to do and so just a normal core conversion, regardless of who the provider is, you normally talk in terms of nine to 12 months after they sign. So there's not a good way to try and apply this 56 number into what are the projections for the next fiscal year. My point of bringing it up was more to tell you, there is a tremendous amount of interest in Jack Henry as a technology provider right now and that's a good objective indicator of the level of interest. Rayna Kumar : That's very helpful. And then as a follow up, David, are you starting to see financial institutions more open to switching to a public cloud infrastructure? And are there any regulatory changes in the FI space that we should be aware of where FIs would be more open to going on to Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure? David Foss : Yes, that's a great follow up Rayna. So the answer is no. There's no great demand today. And I've said this on other calls, no demand right now for a full stack public cloud solution. There's nobody out there clamoring for that today and there are no providers today that are doing everything in the public cloud. Our whole point with this strategy announcement was to make sure that prospective customers and our existing customers know where we're going and when we expect to get there. We believe, and I've done lots of meetings in the last few months with CEOs, both bank and credit union and there's almost no demand today, but there will be in the future and we believe that the regulatory environment is going to shift along with that. So as the regulators become kind of comfortable with the idea of the full stack being processed on the public cloud, you'll see more and more banks and credit unions starting to talk about they are ready to make that move. So, but it's an evolution and something that the regulators need to evolve forward and then of course, customer demand will evolve in that same direction. Rayna Kumar : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Davis from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question. John Davis : Hey, good morning guys. Kevin, just on free cash flow conversion for 2023, is there a chance we're above a 100% given some of the timing items you called out in the fourth quarter or just any kind of color on free cash flow conversion expected this year? Kevin Williams : Yes, I would say JD, I mean, obviously the things that we had this year with the huge increase in commissions in the prepaid because of the strong contract that we had especially in the fourth quarter, but some of that's actually build up from the strong contract we had in Q2 and Q3. So obviously that should level out next year as we continue to move forward. However, I will say that obviously we have to grow every year, so our cores are going up. So it just depends on the timing and what actually gets sold. But so I would say that we'll get, we should be right back at a 100% conversion next year given those working capital things work out, just to change in receivables should be a positive for next year because we collected more of our annual maintenance billings now in FY '23 than we did in FY '22. So all those things being said, we should be back to 100%. Are we going to be above 100%? I mean, it's too early for me to make that prediction JD. John Davis : Okay. No, no, fair enough. And then just on payments, obviously 5% deceleration a little bit, but you had a really tough comp on a year-over-year basis. So have you seen kind of any impact from debit and credit mix normalization, is this on a two-year stack basis you're still kind of low double digits? Is that the right way to think about '23 in the payments segment specifically? Kevin Williams : Are you asking about revenue growth JD or are you talking about payment volume? John Davis : Yes, yes, sorry, revenue growth in payments. Kevin Williams : Well, I think our revenue growth is going to be in the high single digits for FY '23 compared to FY '22. Obviously the big drivers of that are EPS and CPS. Our online bill pay is going to grow a little because it's the slowest grower of the three buckets in our payments. But what we're seeing with EPS and CPS and the demand we're seeing, we should still be able to see very high single digit, maybe even low double digit if everything goes, if all the moons align we could get there JD. John Davis : Okay. And then last one from me just on capital allocation, obviously you announced the Payrailz acquisition which closes later this month, or slated to, can you help us at all size wise, revenue, earnings impact is immaterial, I know you didn't disclose the price when you announced it. But then you also didn't buy back any stock in the quarter. So should we expect kind of more deals in the pipe? Any color there on capital allocation would be helpful? David Foss : Well, so JD, I mean, per the definitive agreement we have in place, we are not allowed to disclose any financial impacts until after we actually close the end of this month. So it will be after that before we can give any guidance towards the magnitude of the acquisition. But you know, I mean, really the reason we didn't buy any stock back this quarter is because our stock performed so extremely well in the quarter. I mean, you think about how much our stock went up from July 1st to now and the fact that we are blacked out from buying our stock back, just like Dave and I are blacked out until we announce earnings from the end of a quarter until we actually announce earnings. So during that time, our stock jumped up 10% up above $200. So would it be a smart buy for us to jump in with both feet right in when we're already have a draw on our revolver when we've got an acquisition out there, and we obviously want to keep some dry powder as we continue to look at other potential targets out there. And that's -- let me jump in on the second part of your question, JD, about other deals in the pipeline. So obviously we wouldn't go on an earnings call and talk specifically about anything, but I've stressed over and over and over again, we always have deals in the pipeline. We've historically been known as a serial acquirer. These past couple, three years have been the anomaly for us. But now that things are getting a little more, we'll say normal when it comes to evaluation expectations, we are absolutely looking at deals today and we'll continue to look for deals that make sense with our strategy. But if you know, well enough, we are a disciplined acquirer. We don't chase the shiny object, but we're always looking. John Davis : Okay. I appreciate all the color. Thanks guys. David Foss : Yep. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Heckmann from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead with your question. Peter Heckmann : Thanks for taking my questions. So is it possible on Payrailz, I know you can't disclose any specifics, but is it possible to talk about whether you assume it would be dilutive to your current net income guidance or accretive or neutral? Kevin Williams : For FY '23 Peter it will probably be slightly dilutive. We haven't totally finalized that yet, because obviously we haven't closed yet, but it will be slightly diluted to FY '23, but it should be accretive in FY '24 and grow nicely from that point on. Peter Heckmann : Okay, that's helpful. And then when you think about your guidance, any material level of buyback incorporated in your '23 guidance? Kevin Williams : There is no buyback incorporated into my guidance fee. Peter Heckmann : Got it and I assume not\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Kevin Williams : Two things just to be clear on. So I mean, anytime I've given guidance past has never assumed buybacks and it's never assumed an acquisition. Peter Heckmann : Correct, correct. And then as you're thinking about M&A what would be the ceiling for net leverage that the management would be comfortable with, would you go to three times on pro forma EBITDA for the right deal? Kevin Williams : Yes, for the right deal, Pete, I mean, I think we would go three times and we've actually, I would say, I mean over the years, and obviously as Dave said, I mean, we've been kind of out of the market the last three years because valuations have been so ridiculous, but I will tell you in the past, I mean, I've had approved financing for deals that would have been three times leveraged. So the boards would be very comfortable that if it's the right deal for the company to move us forward. I mean, as Dave said, we're not going to out and chase the shiny objects, but if it's something that will help us with our laser focus on the FI industry and it was something that our customers need and will drive the company further, then absolutely we'd go three times. Peter Heckmann : Okay, that's helpful. Well, Kevin, have a great time in your retirement and I appreciate all your help over the years. Kevin Williams : You bet Pete. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead with your question. David Koning : Oh yes. Hey guys. And thanks Kevin for all the detail on the margins kind of for the guidance. Is there anything to think about in this year, in this base that would change kind of the long-term outlook, like basically, can we kind of take the little bit of downdraft in 2023 margin and then just kind of grow it more normally off of that base going forward? Like there's nothing new and incremental that would change kind of the longer term progression, right? Kevin Williams : No, there's nothing there, Pete. I mean, as everybody on this call knows, I mean, we have seen some ridiculous inflation in the last four or five months. I mean if you don't think I'm serious distracting McDonald's and buy your kid a quarter pound of cheese and fries and see what you pay for that. I mean, just that. So, I mean, once inflation gets under control and we can grow over that, then absolutely FY '24 we should go right back to our typical margin expansion once we can get over these hurdles. David Koning : Yes, that makes sense. I bought a biscuit at McDonald's yesterday and had that same experience. So, thank you for that. David Foss : This earnings call is going in a totally different direction. David Koning : And then I guess the second question I just had, I know you're paid on number of transactions and I just went back and looked at the Visa debit transactions and they had a really tough comp in the year ago too. But they had a pretty stable growth in the last two quarters. I think they were at like 5% both quarters, but I know you decelerated this quarter and I know there's all sorts of different things you have in them and stuff, but I guess, why else did growth decelerate in the payments business? Kevin Williams : I don't know of anything specific to call out Dave. David Foss : Well, I will tell you that if you remember last year in '21, we had a huge growth in core. And so we had a tough comp in our payments segment this year compared to last year. David Koning : Okay. So it really just is that, yes that makes sense. David Foss : Yes. David Koning : All right, thank you. David Foss : You bet. Thanks, Dave. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Nabhan from Stephens. Please go ahead with your question. Charles Nabhan : Hey, good morning guys. I wanted to get a little color around the timing of margins over the course of '23. I know some of, I know there's a lot of variables right now, but some of the factors you mentioned Kevin, like the conference and the license headwind are weighted towards the front end of the year. So that being the case, is it fair to assume that the bulk of the headwind would be in the front half of the year for '23, and then we could potentially see something above a flattish margin in the back end, all things equal? Kevin Williams : Well, yes Charles, you're absolutely right. I mean, the user group meeting is education conference is in Q1 so that is going to have a big impact on margins in Q1. So it -- you're right. I mean, the comps should be a little easier once we get past that. The license revenue, I mean, that's spread out over the year because that's based on delivery of the license, so that's lumpy. It always has been. So you don't -- really don't know which quarters that's really going to hit, but on a year-over-year basis, so I'm absolutely sure that license revenue is going to be down. And then the other things that are in there is just cost to retain talent is a challenge. And then just that's not going to get any easier in the short term. So that's going to be a challenge for the entire year the way we're seeing it right now. So I think you're right. I think the biggest headwind will be in Q1, but I think there's other challenges that I think we're going to have to deal with and get over the balance of the year. But you're right; the margins should be a little better after we get through Q1. Charles Nabhan : All right, I appreciate that. And as a follow up, I wanted to drill on the Banno a little bit, specifically if you could give us some color around how much of the new customer wins are coming from the existing base versus outside the base? And then secondly, Banno business was a topic at the Analyst Day and I was wondering if we could get an update on that in terms of your ability to cross sell and just sort of how that's -- how that's positioned you for new wins? David Foss : Yes, thanks Chuck. So first off, 100% of the Banno wins are happening inside the Jack Henry core base and we've talked about this in the past, the fact that the great resignation did have an impact on the Banno business as far as developers. It's been commonly reported in the news that high tech developers have been moving around a lot and been commanding very high salaries and we like a lot of companies were impacted by that. So we've been very transparent with our customers, sharing the fact that, and our prospects sharing the fact that we've had to move back our release date as far as Banno outside the base. We also had to move back the release date for Banno business into calendar 2023. And so we believe, we're hearing it from customers and prospects that once we get Banno business out there, that's really going to light a new fire under the Banno platform. But, we're having tremendous success as it is. So we're just excited to get Banno business out there, and we're excited to be able to sell outside the base, but in full transparency. That is the line of business that was probably most impacted by the great resignation here over the past year or so. Kevin Williams : The other thing I'd add is almost a 100% of our new core wins takes Banno. And in fact, Banno is probably and I've been in this industry for a long time, Banno is probably the only solution that I have ever known that actually closed a core deal, because we've actually won some core deals because we have Banno. So it is the top of the line solution out there and so Dave is right, we're selling a 100% inside the base, but that's -- that also includes all those new core customers that were taken away from our competitors. Charles Nabhan : Got it. Thank you very much. And Kevin, thank you for all your help over the years and best of luck in the future. Kevin Williams : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question. Dominick Gabriele : Hey, great. Thanks so much. I just wanted to talk about, why would it be possible let's say medium and small asset size versus large asset size financial institutions might be willing to take on the public cloud solutions that you're developing sooner and is that and then maybe it moves upmarket from there, does that sound correct? Does that make sense that it would start in the smaller FIs first and they might be more willing to do that? And then I just have a follow up, thanks. David Foss : No, I think Dominick, I mean, it's possible if it could happen that way, I don't expect that to happen. I think it's going to be a larger, it will be the larger financial institutions that will make that move because for them there's more potential benefit to move into the public cloud, right? What they're paying is more than a smaller institution. The demands of their customers generally are greater as far as flexibility and new functionality and new releases. The expectations of our customers are higher. So I think it's more likely that it will be, kind of mid-size regional banks that will adopt the public, the full stack public cloud offering first. And I think smaller institutions will follow on. Now we got to wait and see. It's never been done before, so we got to wait and see what happens. But that's my expectation is that it will be a -- the $1 billion to $5 billion, $1 billion to $10 billion banks that are probably going to be first to adopt, and then you'll see smaller banks and the really large regional banks kind of follow along after that, as far as moving everything to public cloud. Now I keep saying everything because we're moving different pieces to public cloud today. I mean, Banno is a public cloud solution. So there are pieces that are already public cloud, but when we're talking about full stack, I think that's the way you're going to see the progression, but we just got to see when we get there. Dominick Gabriele : So start from the middle and kind of expand out from there as far as out\u00e2\u0080\u00a6? David Foss : That's what I think. Dominick Gabriele : Okay. Interesting, very interesting. I was just curious, thank you. And I just -- you listed off of, there's a multi-pronged question in here, so forgive me up front. You've listed a bunch of the different kind of cost pressures that you're seeing from just normalization. You listed a whole bunch of them. Is there any way for us to think about the sizing on the various ones, just from largest to smallest? And then just a follow on to that, but sort of separate, how are your customers adjusting to this kind of similar environment where they're probably also seeing some of the various factors as well, and how do you think that could shift the demand for your products as they think about investing in further technology enhancements? Thanks guys. Kevin Williams : Yes, so that's a good question. And as far as sizing the impact, I don't know that there's any one thing that jumps out at me. I mean, probably personnel cost to attract and retain talent is probably, would probably be the biggest one. The other ones are, insurance. I mean, it's just, it's a hard insurance market out there for E&O and Cyber. I'm sure everybody's experiencing that. I mean, our premiums went up significantly last year and they're going to go up again this year, and then probably right behind that or maybe ahead of that would be our travel expenses because not only are travel expenses going up, but we have more people traveling. So for example, we have over 300, I believe, 300 employees going to the education conference next week in San Diego to take care of our, 2,500 plus customers that are going to be there. So there's -- the travel costs are just going to be up significantly this year compared to last year and I don't see any end in that. And so the second happier question there, Dominick so I think, the thing to keep in mind with our customers is, our customers are in the business of lending money, right? So we've all know that rates are going up. Our customers are continuing to see a net interest margin spread growth. And so, although their costs are going up and we've talked about it previously, we've done CPI increases, and they're certainly seeing that in other areas, their opportunity to make money has also gone up fairly significantly. And they are highly motivated as evidenced by our sales success. They're highly motivated to find technology solutions that can increase their efficiency as an organization and provide opportunities to grab new customers, whether it's on the deposit side or the loan side. So there is no slowing down at all in customer demand for new technology, but you know they do have that benefit of the lending side of their business and the increased net interest margins that they're seeing. Dominick Gabriele : Great. Thank you. Kevin Williams : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Nik Cremo from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Nik Cremo : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question and congrats to Kevin. I was hoping just to dig into the 2023 non-GAAP margin expectations and see if we can get some color across the segments? Kevin Williams : Oh, across the segments. Well, I don't, when I say margins are going to be flat, I think they're probably going to be, I mean, we're going to see some margin improvement probably in core and payments, complimentary. I don't know because obviously we're getting the big pressure in our R&D and SG&A lines and cost of sales. So, some of that margin is not impacting the segments directly because we don't have SG&A and R&D in those segments. So the margins for the segments themselves should be solid with some slight expansion. But it's below the line that we don't allocate the R&D and SG&A that's going to really make it be flat for the year. Nik Cremo : Got it. Thanks for that, extra color. And then for my follow up, I wanted just to ask what you're seeing from your customer base, just in terms of the M&A environment, are you seeing like a big step down in M&A activity relative to 2022 or is like the term fee guidance just more conservative? David Foss : Yes. So Nik, we absolutely are seeing a slowdown on that, and one of the things we've stressed on these calls in the past is, we have a lot of visibility into when customers are acquiring other customers and we're one of the first calls they make if they're looking at acquiring another institution, because they want to get a conversion slot lined up well in advance. And so we have a lot of visibility. We don't necessarily know when one of our customers is going to be acquired. We have a lot of visibility, regarding the overall movement in the market. And that's why we have projected the conversion revenue to be down next year, because we expect M&A overall activity to be down in the coming year. Now that's reading tea leaves and just trying to, understand what's happening in the space, but that's our current expectation is that overall M&A among banks and credit unions will be down in the coming year. Kevin Williams : Yes. I mean, that's like, Nik year before last, I mean, we did not predict the deconversion revenue would be down $33 million at the beginning of the year because M&A appeared to be fairly solid. But we knew it was going to be up this year, but we never dreamt that it was going to be up $33 million this year. So it was basically up in 2022, what it was down in 2021. So it's kind of flat for the two years. But based on what we're seeing in the pipeline right now it looks like M&A is slowing down a little bit. Could that be because the rising interest rates, could it be due to inflation? I mean, I think there's so many different factors that you could point to, that's having an impact on the M&A environment. Nik Cremo : Understood, very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Suchoski from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your question. Ken Suchoski : Hi, good morning, David and Kevin. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. I wanted to follow up on those comments on Banno. Can you just talk about how much opportunity is left to go with those core customers? And then what does the opportunity look like with those non-core customers? How do we try to quantify that opportunity? David Foss : Yes, that's a kind of a how big is big question, Ken, I'll do my best to answer that. So, first off inside the base, we have hundreds of customers who are not running Banno inside the base today. I would guess it's close to a thousand, probably existing core customers that are not running Banno today, so lots and lots of opportunity inside the core base. And then when we get outside the core base, so think about the success that we've had with overall, what we used to refer to as Profit Stars, of course, we don't use that brand anymore, but the whole goal there was to sell to non-Jack Henry core customers. And we have roughly 7,000 banks and credit unions that we've sold variety of different non-core solutions to, customers who are not running a Jack Henry core, but they're running other things. So we have that base of 7,000 banks and credit unions that are already doing something with Jack Henry that's non-core that we can go and mine. They already know us. We have a relationship with them. We can go and mine that base with new sales opportunities once we have Banno regs to go outside the base. So there's a tremendous opportunity. The other thing I'll stress is, I've said on the call over and over, almost any bank or credit union in the United States today is running a mobile banking solution and internet banking solution and they look totally different. They function totally different. They are not the same system. Banno eliminates that concern. Banno is a single platform, so that the user experience is consistent, whether you're on your phone or your laptop, and banks and credit unions want to move in that direction. So there's a motivator there for them to want to go in that direction. We just need to get that delivered outside the base. Ken Suchoski : Okay, great. And then I wanted to ask about consolidating the brands and the opportunity there, David, I believe you mentioned that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to operate as one company. And I think your comments for it, it leads to a better client experience. Can you just talk about how you think that might impact your sales performance, your revenue growth, and I guess, retention rates across your customer base? David Foss : Sure, yes. So we're very excited about this adjustment. We made the announcement on August 1, so just a couple of weeks ago and it ties in, so a few key points to this. Number one, we now can eliminate any of the marketing expense associated with supporting several different brands. So there's a logical expense cost savings there, when you move to one brand. But more importantly, I think we've had this initiative that we call One Jack Henry in play for about a year or two now. Greg Adelson, our President talked about it at the May Investor Conference. And it's been at this push that we've had toward delivering a more consistent experience for our customers. In the past with the three different brands, there was kind of this natural thought that the different brands are almost like different companies. And so moving toward one brand, one company, consistent processes, consistent experience for our customers and certainly for our prospects, we believe will aid us not only in -- on the expense side, but on the sales side will help when it comes to customer perception of our company and making sure that any existing customer gives a really positive referral to a prospective customer around doing business with Jack Henry. So I would say, some of you published studies on our customer sat ratings. We report them regularly. Jack Henry has the highest customer satisfaction ratings in our industry. The one thing that we get knocked on once in a while had been, well, you kind of operate like separate companies. Well, with this project, we hope to eliminate that concern and then overall we'll have the highest customer sat ratings by far. Ken Suchoski : Great. Thank you very much, David. I appreciate the thoughts as always and Kevin congrats on your retirement. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Ken. Operator :  Our next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. James Faucette : Hey, good morning everybody and thanks for all the commentary. I wanted to go back to Banno and you talked about like how you -- the great resignation is impacting a bit the release states, but also found your commentary around the market and where you think you'll see early traction and how that will evolve, interesting. How about from a feature and feature development perspective, how much feature development do you think needs to evolve to address the different market opportunities that you're looking at for that platform and capabilities? And how does kind of staffing and those kinds of things impact adding those features and maturing them? Kevin Williams : Yes, it's an interesting question, James. When you're in this business, the request for new features never stops, right? As soon as you get to where you think you've got everybody beat, somebody comes up with another idea and sure it would be nice if you would do X. So that's an ongoing project. The good news for us is, we know on the consumer side with what we have in market today, we know that we have a tremendous solution that beats pretty much any competitor on the consumer side. The only missing piece has been for commercial customers with Banno business. So we're very confident that once we get Banno business in market, we're going to have a terrific solution to compete with anybody. But you can't ever expect that you're going to stop developing new features, adding new features, adding enhancements to a solution like that, because not only does our customer demand increased, but their customers are demanding more functionality through a platform like that. They want to be able to do more things through a platform like that. So that's an ongoing commitment for us for, I won't say forever, but forever is a long time, but it will go on for a very long time. The really good news is, the whole tech modernization strategy that we've been talking about is built on that same platform that Banno is on. And so anything that we do in the future with Banno and adds to the overall story of the tech modernization offering that we'll have from Jack Henry, and so it just continues to bolster what we've been talking about as the future of technology for financial institutions. James Faucette : And then what is your sense. I mean, it's an interesting period and one that a lot of us aren't familiar with in terms of like prices, price changes and increases and general inflation, how does that impact or how are you expecting that will impact the pricing discussions in that part of the selling promotion, even for your products and obviously what's the competitive environment associated with that look like? Kevin Williams : Yes, the competitive environment has not changed. And, we've talked about it before, pretty much any large purchase in our space today, customers, banks and credit unions will involve a consultant and the consultant's role in that engagement is not only to do the comparison of one product to another, but it is to negotiate price. And so, regardless of what's happening in the economy, the consultant is there to try and make sure that they squeeze every, every opportunity out of the engagement that they can. So I can't say that anything dramatic has changed as a result of what's happening in the general economy when it comes to customer expectation or consultant expectation and I don't think anything is going to change. The opportunity for us when it comes to pricing is by offering an enhanced solution, a differentiated solution, kind of back to your first question, right? The more, the more we add to these platforms that are differentiated from our competitors, that's where the opportunity is to charge more. Because then we're not, then it's not just table stakes. It's not just, which solution looks better. It's which one really functions better. And today Banno has that reputation and so that's our opportunity and our challenge is to make sure that we continue to stay ahead of the pack as far as future function, because that's where customers will pay you more. Operator : And our next question is a follow up from Dominick Gabriele from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your follow up. Dominick Gabriele : Hey, great, thanks. I just wanted to talk to you about the guidance on the revenue growth and how we should, how investors should think about, in the Investor Day. I think there was a slide that said, the long term revenue grows expectation between 8.5% and 9%. And then we're kind of, maybe roughly 50 basis points below that for 2023. Is there any way you could help us walk between those two points, new customer sales and all those various waterfall features, that is creating the Delta? Thanks so much. Kevin Williams : Well, I mean, you're absolutely right. I mean, at the Analyst Day, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said 8.5% to 9% and we're right at the 8.5%. So yes, we're on the low end of that. But considering the year that we're coming off of with the huge growth we had of almost 9% in 2022, I mean, it makes for pretty tough comp. So I mean, if we can grow 8.5% in 2023 compared to 2022, I mean, I'm thinking for a company that's 90% plus recurring revenue, that's a pretty good feat to grow at that pace. Obviously can we grow -- get back to 9% in 2024? I would hope so, but my crystal ball is a little foggy going out that far. Dominick Gabriele : Sure. Now that makes sense. And congrats on all the wins this quarter too. Kevin Williams : You bet. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Kevin Williams for any closing remarks. Kevin Williams : Thanks, Jamie. Obviously we're very pleased with results of our ongoing operations and we are excited for the future with everything that, all the new deals that we've signed in the previous quarter. I want to thank all of our associates for the way they have handled these challenges by taking care of themselves and our customers, and continue to work hard to improve our company, to continue moving forward for the future. All of us at Jack Henry continue to focus on what is best for our customers and our shareholders. I want to thank you again for joining us today. And Jamie with that, would you please provide the replay number? Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we will conclude the conference call today to access the digital replay of this conference. You may dial 1 (877) 344-7529 or (412) 317-0088, beginning approximately one hour after the conclusion of today's event. You'll be prompted to enter a conference number which will be 279-20-74. Please record your name and company when joining. The conference has now concluded. We do thank you for attending the presentation and you may now disconnect your lines.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vance Sherard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Vance Sherard : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry first quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today is David Foss, Board Chair and CEO; Mimi Carsley, CFO and Treasurer; and Greg Adelson, President and COO. After these opening remarks, I will turn the call over to Dave for his thoughts about the state of our business, financial and sales performance for the quarter, industry comments and other key initiatives. After Dave concludes his comments, Mimi will provide additional commentary regarding the financial results and fiscal year guidance included in the press release issued yesterday that is available from the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website. We will then open the lines for Q&A. As a reminder, this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to multiple factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to multiple risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures are in yesterday's press release. I will now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Vance, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started today, I'd like to welcome the other folks in the room with me as introduced a moment ago by Vance. To begin, I'd like to welcome Mimi Carsley to her first quarterly call with Jack Henry. Mimi has been sitting in the CFO chair for a couple of months now and has spent a good bit of time immersing herself on the details of our business. Of course, you'll hear from her in a bit, and I'm happy to have the opportunity to introduce her for the first time to all of you. Additionally, I'd like to welcome our President and Chief Operating Officer, Greg Adelson, to his first earnings call. Many of you know Greg from our Investor Day and other events. Greg will be a participant in these calls going forward, but today, he will primarily focus on answering any questions regarding our recent Payrailz acquisition. And last, I'd like to welcome Vance Sherard to his first earnings call. As you probably know, Vance was recently promoted to Vice President of Investor Relations, and he will host these calls every quarter going forward. With that, let's move to the update section of our call. As I noted in the press release, I'm very pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth for our company. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for the quarter. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, total revenue increased 8% for the quarter and also increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were up slightly as compared to the prior year quarter. Turning to the segments. We had another solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 6% for the quarter and also increased by 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment again performed very well, posting an 8% increase in revenue this quarter and a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had another strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with an 8% increase in revenue this quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis. As I've discussed previously, our first quarter is normally our lightest sales bookings quarter because our fourth quarter tends to be extremely strong, and the sales pipeline is depleted as a result. As you may recall, the June quarter was the strongest sales quarter in the history of the company, so we certainly expected that historical trends hold true. This year, however, although sales bookings didn't set a record, they were up by double digits over the prior year quarter with many notable wins. In the quarter, we booked six competitive core takeaways and five deals to move existing in-house customers to our private cloud environment. As some of you may recall, we started last year with six core wins and ended with a total of 52 for the year. Although I can't predict our full year performance with any certainty, the pipeline gives us optimism that we're likely to see that kind of trend this year as well. We continue to see success with our card processing solution, signing nine new debit processing clients this quarter and one new credit client. We also continue to see remarkable success signing clients to our Banno digital suite with 60 new contracts in Q1. Speaking of our digital suite, at the end of Q1, we were hosting approximately 8.3 million registered users on the platform, and that number is now growing at almost 200,000 users per month. At the end of Q1 last year, we had about 6 million registered users on the platform, so we've experienced more than a 38% increase in the intervening 12 months. We are currently expecting to have the Banno Business offering generally available in early 2023 and providing another avenue to increase the number of Banno users. The Banno digital suite continues on the path to becoming the industry-leading digital banking solution in our markets. The continued success we've seen with sales and adoption of our digital suite is consistent with the expectations coming out of the Bank Director Technology survey published in August. As they do every year, Bank Director surveyed hundreds of their subscribers during June and July regarding a variety of technology prioritization and spending topics. More than 50% of the responses they received were from bank CEOs and/or Board members, and more than 80% of the respondent banks were greater than $500 million in assets. Although this survey didn't predict spending for 2023, it did highlight that the median increase in expected technology spending this year was 11% as compared to the prior year.  One of the interesting items from this year's survey was the analysis of technology and use by respondent banks as it relates to their ability to serve different generational groups. Fully 93% of the respondents said they had the technology in place to serve baby boomers, but only 25% said they have the necessary technology in place to effectively serve Gen Z-ers. Of course, it's the younger generations that expect to conduct all banking services without ever entering a branch. Clearly, the initiative for all banks to get to a digital presentation layer has a long way to go. All of this bodes well for the future of our digital suite as well as the other innovative solutions offered by Jack Henry, which helped facilitate an improved customer experience through a digital front door at the financial institution. On August 9, we announced a definitive agreement for Jack Henry to acquire Payrailz, and we completed the deal on August 31. Payrailz accelerates Jack Henry's technology modernization strategy by immediately adding next-generation digital payment capabilities to our public cloud-native technology stack and payments ecosystem. Payrailz also enhances Jack Henry's payments as a service strategy, enabling clients to simplify the complexity of payments, modernize their existing payments channel and remain at the center of their account holders' payment experiences. Acquiring Payrailz has strengthened our position in the payment space by providing our collective clients with additional functionality, optionality and flexibility that enhances their diverse digital and payment strategies. To that end, in mid-October, we announced the launch of a stand-alone person-to-person payment solution that further supports our real-time payment strategy. This offering is available for stand-alone implementation or as a strategic component of the full Payrailz payments platform. In addition to the Payrailz acquisition, we recently announced the release of our new Financial Crimes Defender application, an expanded partnership with Mastercard and a new relationship with Google. We're excited about these key relationships with Mastercard and Google and look forward to continuing the rollout of Financial Crimes Defender. All of these announced solutions and relationships support our ongoing mission to supply our community and regional financial institution clients with leading-edge public cloud-native financial technology offerings. As many of you know, we normally conduct our two largest client conferences in the fall each year. This year, we combined those conferences into one in-person event in San Diego called Jack Henry Connect. We hosted thousands of attendees at the conference, giving us the opportunity to interact directly with many of our existing clients and prospects. Of course, events like this not only present a wonderful opportunity for relationship building and education, but they also generate a significant number of new sales leads. During the Connect conference, I hosted our Annual CEO Forum, attended this year by more than 200 client CEOs. Although we didn't conduct a formal survey during the meeting, the general feedback was that the attendees are concerned about the general economy, but committed to using technology to position their businesses for the future. Last month, we were proud to be included in Newsweek's list of top 100 most loved workplaces. Jack Henry ranked 17th overall and second in the financial services category. The ranking came as a result of a survey conducted by Newsweek of almost 1.5 million employees at thousands of companies, large and small. The list recognizes companies that put respect, caring and appreciation for their employees at the center of their business model. This is an incredible honor for us in no small part because this list focused on several qualities which we aspire every day : collaboration and teamwork, opportunities for advancement, transparency, corporate citizenship and how our company lives up to its own stated values. In addition to understanding the need to treat our employees well, we recognize that business risk resulting from climate change constitutes a key component of our risk management responsibility. Our TCFD-aligned disclosure is included in Jack Henry's 2022 sustainability report and details our assessment of Jack Henry's climate-related risks from acute and chronic physical risks to transition risks like greenhouse gas emissions and regulation. I encourage you to visit our corporate responsibility website via the Investor Relations tab for more information about our ESG efforts and to review our published sustainability reports. As Mimi will highlight in her comments, we recently sold one of our facilities in San Diego. This sale was the result of our ongoing efforts to analyze what our facility requirements will be in the future. We continue to evaluate the best operating model for our company as it relates to remote versus in-office work. As a result, we are not anticipating any significant reduction in our physical footprint at this time. We instead plan to make slower incremental changes that align with our go-forward workforce strategy. Next week, we will conduct our Annual Shareholder Meeting, and we'll again be hosting this meeting in person in Monett. We are excited to be able to meet with our shareholders in person, but we're also very aware of the ongoing pandemic-related concerns that arises when you assemble a group of people. With this in mind, we will once again offer an option to observe remotely for those who wish to listen without attending the meeting. Despite the uncertainty caused by the economic challenges we're all dealing with today, let me remind you of a few of the fundamentals about our company, fundamentals we emphasize regularly in our discussions with investors and analysts. First, slightly more than 90% of our non-GAAP revenue is recurring in nature, and most of it is tied to long-term contracts for critical processing systems. Second, we have a very manageable amount of debt on the balance sheet, and we continue to operate with a solid cash position. Third, we have paid quarterly dividends since 1991, increasing them 33x over that same period, and we continue to be committed to our dividend policy moving forward. Fourth, we have an extremely engaged workforce as we've seen in our employee engagement survey results and Best Place to Work awards. Fifth, our clients are generally well capitalized and as evidenced by the survey I stated earlier, we're continuing to increase their investment in modernizing their technology infrastructure. And finally, remember that we weathered the financial crisis 15 years ago with very few bumps or bruises and it's highly unlikely that any near-term economic uncertainty results in a similar level of financial institution impacts. As we move forward, I remain extremely optimistic regarding our levels of sales activity and customer responses to the solutions we're delivering and the strategies we are executing. We will continue with our disciplined approach to running the company, and we expect that approach to continue to provide stability and solid performance for our employees, customers and shareholders.  With that, I'll turn it over to Mimi for some detail on the numbers. Mimi Carsley : Thanks, Dave. Good morning. I appreciate this opportunity to speak with everyone for the first time as Jack Henry's CFO. Having spent my career at the intersection of finance and technology, I'm thrilled to be at such a highly regarded company with a focus on delivering shareholder value. As highlighted by Dave's comments, Jack Henry has had a successful first quarter, and I'll share some color on the financial details driving those results. Total revenue was up 8% for the quarter, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. So let's jump into the details. Services and support revenue increased 8% in the quarter. Deconversion revenue was up $800,000 for the quarter. Consistent with previous guidance, we expect approximately $35 million in deconversion revenue this fiscal year and is expected to be heavier in the second half. However, forecasting deconversion revenue is always challenging. Our private and public cloud offerings showed robust growth in the quarter, growing 10%. Product delivery and services revenue grew 11% in the quarter, impacted by the return of our in-person user group conference and higher consulting activities, offset by slightly lower implementation revenue. Non-GAAP total support and services revenue grew 7% for the quarter. Processing revenue increased 10% on a GAAP basis and 9% on a non-GAAP basis in the quarter. The increase was primarily driven by higher card volumes. Additionally, digital revenue continues to show rapid growth led by strong demand for our Banno digital platform. Now turning to costs. Cost of revenue was up 8% with card costs in line with card revenue, higher personnel, license and amortization expense, partly offset by a decrease in labor cost deferrals. Research and development expense increased 23%, primarily due to higher personnel costs. SG&A rose 12%, driven by increases in travel, personnel, consulting, professional services and meeting-related expenses, partly offset by the gain on the sale of assets. The increase in meeting expense was due to both our first in-person user group conference since fiscal '20 and the consolidation of our two user group events. Expenses for the consolidated conference were solely in the first quarter instead over the first two quarters, and this will be the norm going forward. We concluded Q1 with strong results, delivering net income growth of 4% with fully diluted earnings per share of $1.46. For transparency, the impact from the gain on sale of assets, the Payrailz acquisition and deconversion fees are shown as part of the non-GAAP adjustments in the press release. Now turning our attention to cash flow. Operating cash flow increased to $137 million for the quarter, primarily due to a higher collection of accounts receivables. As a reminder, our cash flow is impacted by the collection of annual maintenance in Q1 and Q4, so the conversion accelerates at both the beginning and end of the fiscal year. Currently, total R&D spending is slightly elevated due to the integration of Payrailz that should normalize by the end of the fiscal year. Free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software, adding back net proceeds from disposal of assets was $116 million or 109% conversion. Jack Henry has been a responsible steward of our investors' capital, and as the new CFO, I can assure you that our capital allocation strategy will remain fundamentally consistent. We are committed to maintaining ample operating liquidity, reinvesting for growth, evaluating strategic acquisitions, paying dividends and opportunistically repurchasing our stock. This strong dedication to value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 23.2% or 170 basis point increase.  To provide some extra color on the quarter's acquisition, as Dave mentioned, the strategic Payrailz acquisition closed on August 31. Thus, the current quarter includes one month of results. The purchase price was $230 million and Payrailz is expected to contribute approximately $12 million in revenue to Jack Henry's fiscal '23. The $0.22 GAAP dilutive impact for fiscal '23 is driven by operations, incremental interest and amortization. As previously mentioned, the acquisition is expected to become GAAP accretive in fiscal '24. Focusing ahead, let me share updated guidance. We provided transparent GAAP and non-GAAP full year guidance in the press release. The GAAP guidance is now inclusive of the Payrailz acquisition and the gain on asset in addition to deconversion revenue. GAAP revenue growth for fiscal '23 is now expected to be 7.7% to 8%, driven by the acquisition of Payrailz as there is no change in our deconversion fee outlook. Guidance for non-GAAP revenue growth remains unchanged at 8.2% to 8.6%. Outlook for the full year GAAP operating margin of approximately 23% impacted by both the gain on sale of assets and the acquisition. Full year non-GAAP operating margin guidance remains unchanged at relatively flat year-on-year. We remain very focused on returning to margin expansion in fiscal '24. Full year GAAP EPS guidance is now a range of $4.90 to $4.94. Our sequential quarterly cadence for non-GAAP revenue growth is expected to decelerate slightly in the second quarter when compared to current analyst estimates and then rebound with sequential increases in both the third and fourth quarters to achieve our full year guidance targets. The trend is similar for non-GAAP operating margin, but while the second quarter will see a decrease on a year-on-year basis, it will not be the same level seen in the first quarter, allowing us to achieve our full year guidance targets. Based on a solid first quarter results, continued disciplined execution and near-term visibility of continued momentum, we are on track to meet our non-GAAP revenue growth and operating margin guidance. So in closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to best serve our financial institutions and their clients, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. We thank all of our investors for their continued confidence in Jack Henry. Chuck, will you please open the call for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Vasu Govil with KBW. Vasundhara Govil : My first question is for you, Mimi. It's nice to speak with you, and welcome to your first earnings call. Couple of questions on the guide. First, I guess, with the $6 million gain on sale already contemplated in the guide when you guys guided 3 months ago. And then if I think about the change in guide, it seems like non-GAAP margins, you're not really expecting a change. So is all of the dilution pretty much related to the acquisition? And then a third part to my question, I think last quarter, if you go back, Kevin had sort of highlighted the margin guidance being conservative with some areas of potential upside. Is that view still the same? Or has anything changed on your expectation there? Mimi Carsley : Thanks, Vasu, and thanks for participating today. To address your question, the real estate was not contemplated at the time we reconfirmed guidance at the close of the acquisition. Relative to -- I believe your second question was around guidance, as I stated, the only changes that impacted our guidance was the acquisition and the gain on sale. And then your third question regarding margin outlook, it's still early in the year. We're optimistic, but we are facing inflationary headwinds as a business, but we feel optimistic that we will deliver as to our guidance target. Vasundhara Govil : And Dave, if I could squeeze in one for you. I sort of got your comments on the seasonal softness in new core wins. But some of your peers have called out some softness in new signings in larger deals over $50 million. So I just wanted to get your sense if you were seeing any change in sort of appetite in signing deals in any of your cohort that would concern you at all? David Foss : Yes. Thank you, Vasu. I would have been -- I would have felt left out if you hadn't asked me a question. So thank you for that. As far as the cadence of deal, there is no change. The pipeline that we have right now of potential deals is by far larger than it's ever been. The cadence of deal signings is consistent with what we saw last year, as I tried to highlight in the call today.  And I'll point out to you with respect to larger deals, and you might not be surprised to learn this, but I personally am involved often times in larger deals. I don't certainly don't get involved in every deal, but I'm involved in larger deals. Just in the next two weeks, we have -- let me think about this. So we have our shareholder meeting next week. So the week after that, we have three different institutions coming in here to Dallas over the course of two days. So I'm hosting three different CEOs, three different financial institutions here in Dallas over the course of two days. And then the week after that, we have another one coming in that I'm hosting in Dallas. And again, I only get involved in larger deals. So I'll just tell you, from my perspective, and I've heard all the same things you've heard about the cadence of deals or the pace of deals slowing down. Jack Henry is not experiencing that. Our pipeline is robust and there is a lot of activity as far as deals that we're working on, both on the core side and with regard to the other products in our suite. And I just highlighted for you, we just signed 60 new Banno deals in the quarter, and that pace isn't slowing down either. So I'm -- we'll see as the election -- and by the way, I haven't seen a single thing about the election. I got up and came right here this morning. So I have no idea what happens as far as the election is concerned, but we'll see what the election results, what impact that has on people's sentiment around the economy. We'll see what makes out here over the next few weeks as far as the general economy. But what we're seeing right now, there's no slowdown in activity. Operator : The next question will come from Rayna Kumar with UBS. Rayna Kumar : Congratulations, Mimi and Vance. Can you talk a little bit about how your technology modernization strategy is progressing? I think I heard earlier that you said you have five new wins onto your private cloud offerings. Just wondering if you're seeing anything on the public cloud yet, and just how your discussions with banks and credit unions are going on some of these new products? David Foss : Sure. So first off, there were six new core wins that I highlighted in my update. And again, that was exactly the same number that we had last year for the first quarter. So that's on pace for what we normally see after a huge fourth quarter as far as the core side is concerned. And so still lots of activity with regard to our traditional offerings. On the -- on the tech modernization strategy. So as you can probably imagine, lots of customers engaged with us on those discussions trying to understand what the future looks like. But as I've stressed regularly on these calls, this was all about a strategy, and so we have a couple of modules in production today, wires being the first. We have customers using those modules. But this is a several year strategy before you're going to see anybody signing for the whole the whole stack of components that are on this tech modernization strategy. And I firmly believe, and I've said this on the call before, because we have such a unique strategy because it's such a forward-looking cloud -- truly cloud-native strategy as compared to what some of our competitors have done, we are getting a lot of attention, a lot of people talking to us about potentially signing with our current offerings with the anticipation that they will be able to move to the public cloud offering in the future. So we're on pace. We have -- I will point out, we have published for our existing customers, we've published now the roadmap for them to see. We haven't published anything externally yet because as I've -- as I witnessed now, we have some competitors out there that are trying to figure out how to do what Jack Henry is doing. So we're probably going to slow roll a little bit the public publication; but for our customers, to consume. We have published roadmaps now. Our customers are aware of kind of what the cadence is and where we're going as far as delivery of the tech modernization strategy. The other thing I would emphasize is tech modernization is not just focused on core. And so a big part of the Payrailz acquisition was to build out that strategy for the payments -- for part of the payments offerings that we have public cloud native. We're also the Financial Crimes Defender solution that I just alluded to. Financial Crimes Defender is a public cloud native solution built on that platform that we've been talking about. And so this is truly a modernization for everything we do at Jack Henry, not just the core solution to Jack Henry. Rayna Kumar : That was really helpful. And then just a question here for Mimi. Your adjusted payment segment revenue that was up 7% in the quarter. If you could just break out the drivers for us? Then how should we think about payments revenue for the remainder of the year? I think on the fourth quarter call, we would think the guidance was high single digits. Is that still the right way to think about it? Mimi Carsley : Thanks, Rayna, for your question. So as we reported payments grew 8% this quarter, you roughly think about that as about 60% from cards, about 22% from the EPS business, both of which are growing quite strong and then about 18% from bills pay. So -- and I would say that, that estimate of high single digits is still intact. Operator : The next question will come from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Could you give us a preliminary view of how you see margins trending in fiscal '24, given the substantial pressure you've called out in '23? In other words, how much of the inflationary pressure in FY '23 is simply related to Payrailz necessary investments related to that? versus pressures that might be more persistent and push into FY '24? Mimi Carsley : Dave, this is Mimi. I'll take that. So I would say that we're still very early in '23. So FY '24 is a long way away in a very uncertain global contracts. But we remain quite vigilant in our focus on expanding margin growth in FY '24. And some of the headwinds that we've seen in FY '23, some of them were onetime in nature, like the Java payment in terms of the year-on-year impact. And others, we're starting to see some loosening of inflationary pressure as it relates to personnel costs. So... David Foss : I think the thing that I would add to that, Dave, the things we've highlighted in the past and maybe just alluded to Java, for example, going from zero to actually -- and this is impacting all companies, not just Jack Henry, but going from zero to having to pay for that technology, the travel -- the uptick that we've seen in travel. So that will normalize now. So when you think about FY '24, the travel uptick will have been baked into the FY '23 comps. And so -- so that should provide the opportunity for margin expansion as we look into '24. And then on the wage side, we, like everybody, have seen wage inflation, but that is really starting to normalize as well. And so I think that has baked into -- will be baked into the '23 numbers when you get to comparing us during '24. So I think a lot of those things that we've highlighted and that most companies have highlighted, that stuff is really starting to normalize for Jack Henry. And I think it provides opportunity for us to get back the margin expansion again next year. David Togut : And just as a follow-up, could you update us on your capital allocation priorities? Maybe you underscored your responsible approach to capital allocation. How is your approach to capital allocation, perhaps different from Kevin? And then maybe more broadly, what are you seeing in terms of the acquisition pipeline, businesses that fit into your strategic priorities and which might also meet your kind of valuation threshold? Mimi Carsley : Thanks, Dave. Great question. David Foss : I'll take the second part, but you go ahead if you want to do the first part. Mimi Carsley : I think I'll do the first part. As I said, I would expect it to be fundamentally consistent. What I look for, as I said, is strategic fit, cultural fit the opportunities for both organic growth through investments as well as potential acquisitions and then returning capital to shareholders. So we'll explore all of those. I've been quite impressed, Jack Henry has been a very disciplined serial acquirer in the history with a very robust diligence and evaluation process. And so I would expect looking at all -- exploring all of those options to continue. David Foss : I'll just add in, Dave. I know that all of you who have listened to me talk know that for early months of this calendar year, I was very optimistic that as the year progressed, there were going to be some really nice opportunities as far as acquisition is concerned. I'll just say the pipeline of potential good companies to acquire is not nearly as robust as what I thought it was going to be. We were very bullish on Payrailz and what that does for us and for our customers, the opportunity that presents long term for us and for our customers. But there aren't a lot of Payrailz companies sitting out there. So we're looking -- we're always looking at potential deals. We're always looking at opportunities. But it isn't the market that I was hoping it was going to be as far as the opportunity for additional acquisition. Operator : The next question will come from Nik Cremo with Credit Suisse. Nik Cremo : I just wanted to ask about the Banno Business offering being rolled out early next year. Is there any way for us to think about the potential revenue uplift for that product on a stand-alone basis or on a per customer basis? David Foss : Yes. Nik, it's Dave. I wish that I could give you some really good expectations as far as building a model. The thing to know is many of our customers who have purchased Banno and have implemented Banno already on the retail side, and of course, it's only been serving retail customers so far. Many of them have either signed for or indicated that when Banno Business rolls out, they want to implement annual business for their business customers. So we already have a pretty rich, we'll say, backlog, pipeline of customers who want to put that into production. The tougher thing for me to project for you is how many business customers will adopt that and at what pace. So I wouldn't want to go too far in trying to predict what the revenue uplift will be, but we know that it will be there. We know that over time, it will be significant because we're aware of many customers who have a large number of business clients that they want to put into production. But I think it's too early for us at this point to try and project for you what that might look like. I will point out that we haven't baked anything significant into the financials at this point for the remainder of the fiscal year because we want to see -- you know us well, we're a disciplined, conservative organization. We want to see how this rollout goes and make sure that adoption is what we think it's going to be, but we haven't gone out on a limb as far as projecting revenue or adoption with that solution. We're not going to do that until we get into general availability and ensure that the adoption is what we think it's going to be. Nik Cremo : Understood. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to just get an update and see what you're hearing from your customers in terms of their M&A pipeline and just the overall M&A environment as it pertains to your customer base and if you're still seeing the same type of slowdown that you called out last quarter. David Foss : Sure. Yes. And we are. Nothing has really changed in that regard, which is why -- the interesting thing about deconversion revenue, of course, is it happens when one of our customers get acquired, and I know that many of you know that, but just to make sure everybody on the call understands the conversion revenue happens when one of our customers gets acquired, and they essentially buy their way out of their existing contract. We know that has slowed as compared to the prior year. We're comfortable with the guide that we've provided. But as I say all the time, that's the revenue you don't want, right? It's the revenue that comes when a customer is leaving because they've been acquired. On the other side, on the flip side, our customers acquiring other customers, we have great visibility into that, and we know that's happening. We're involved in some of those deals, but that has also slowed. And so I think the overall M&A environment because of what's happened to the valuation on bank stocks and what's happened just in the general economy and people wondering what's going to happen, the whole market for bank M&A has slowed, and we're continuing to see what I highlighted last quarter. Operator : The next question will come from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : I know you referenced the recent survey for bank spending. But I'm just wondering from your conversations and what's happening in the interest rate environment with net interest margins going up. How do you feel about what bank spending will look like in calendar 2023. David Foss : Yes, it's a good question. And I was a little frustrated. Normally Bank Director does project forward into '23. The other survey I always quote on these calls is the Cornerstone Advisors survey, which will come out, I think, the end of -- or mid-December, if I remember correctly. So normally, I highlight that on the February call. So everything that I know right now is anecdotal. It's me talking to bankers. I will highlight again, I said it in my opening comments, but I'll highlight again, we had more than 200 bank CEOs, and I'm just talking about CEOs in the CEO forum that's hosted by me in San Diego with us about a month ago. And they're generally a pretty optimistic group. I mean they are -- we've seen, of course, interest rate rise on the lending side, on the loan side have not had to raise rates as quickly on the deposit side, although that's coming and they know it. But for the first time in years, they have a spread, an interest margin spread to work with. And they are generally pretty upbeat, generally feel like they're pretty well capitalized. I don't have a whole lot of risky credits on the balance sheet. And so generally feeling like things are going to be okay. And of course, for them, then spending on technology, all of them are continuing to focus on what technology do we need to compete in the future. And that's where not only the tech modernization story that we have at Jack Henry, but the digital banking offerings that we have, both for consumers -- and now for commercial customers, for lending as well as deposits. Remember, we do a complete online commercial loan origination digitally through Jack Henry. So all of those things are topics today for our customers. And again, they're generally upbeat. Now as I stated earlier, I haven't seen anything about the election results. So that all may change day after tomorrow, I don't know. But as of a month ago, pretty optimistic about their opportunities and their interest in spending money on technology. Kartik Mehta : And then, Greg, I wanted to ask you a question on payrolls. Maybe just your thoughts on if this helps you differentiate your product or how it helps you differentiate or maybe it provides some other benefits. Just to understand how this acquisition will benefit Jack Henry. Greg Adelson : Yes. Thanks, Kartik. Good to hear from you. So a couple of things. I think from a standpoint of differentiation, one of the things that you need to remember is that this is not a bill pay solution. It is a payments platform -- so it is different than our iPay offering from a standpoint that it actually drives all different kinds of payment solutions and can integrate directly in because of its API base into our PayCenter offering as well. So there's a lot of opportunity to utilize various components of that as part of our overall payments as a payments as a service type of strategy. So I think there's components that we were going to build out that we don't have to build out. There's things that they've already created. Dave alluded to the standalone P2P solution, which is actually an open-loop solution. So it creates the ability for both the receiver and the sender don't have to be in the same network. That's something that, again, will provide complementary opportunities to existing P2P solutions that are out there today and alternatives for our customers. There's a very slick account-to-account transfer solution that actually will create some opportunities within our existing base. But when you look at the overall landscape of payment players, especially ones that have multiple features, we really think that this one gives us the opportunity to accelerate what we were doing in the payments-as-a-service strategy and our technology modernization strategy. Kartik Mehta : And Mimi, just one last question. I think you might have already said this, and if you have, I apologize. The acquisition cost is that in a certain quarter or is that over the next few quarters? Mimi Carsley : Are you talking about the impact to our guidance? It's embedded within the full year guide. Kartik Mehta : Yes. Yes. Mimi Carsley : Yes. So as I mentioned, the impact will be positively obviously, on the revenue contribution. And then from an EPS perspective, the ongoing operations, the amortization as well as the interest expense. Operator : The next question will come from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Peter Heckmann : Great. I think most of my questions have been answered, but just a few little follow-ups. That onetime gain related to the sale, was that in SG&A? Mimi Carsley : Yes. Peter Heckmann : Okay. And then in terms of Payrailz, the -- I guess, in terms of the -- I guess we can estimate what the per share impact was of the gain. But in terms of isolating kind of the dilutive impact of Payrailz for fiscal '23, it's somewhere along the lines of $0.10. And forgive me if you already answered it, but how do you see that tracking to breakeven into profits over the next year or two? Mimi Carsley : Thanks for the question, Peter. As I said in my prepared remarks, it's $0.22 for the full year impact. And just to reiterate again, the only changes in our guidance are the impact from the sale as well as Payrailz. The core business remains -- guidance remains unchanged. Peter Heckmann : Great. And then the thoughts on just getting the business to breakeven and beyond or...? Mimi Carsley : Yes, we fully expect it to be accretive in fiscal '24. Operator : The next question will come from Dom Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Congratulations on everybody's new roles. If we just -- it feels like the real economy is starting to change. Could you just talk about the levers that you all have to pull to protect ROIC in a more challenging revenue environment. Obviously, as you mentioned, Jack Henry has a lot of contract revenue. But any extra detail there would be great. And then I just have a follow-up. Mimi Carsley : Dom, thanks for the question. We're not concerned. We feel good, as Dave alluded to, the health of our clients, the underlying credit quality of their loan portfolios, positive net interest margin. So the sales pipeline is very robust. So we're not concerned here.  To your question on levers, I would look to the strong free cash flow generation and the reoccurring -- high reoccurring revenue percent for the business. And then I also would highlight, some of our exposure is different from our competitors in terms of high debit card, it's transactional, not interchange. So I would look to some of those in terms of the resiliency of our underlying business model. David Foss : If I could, let me add to that. My last -- one of my comments in my opening was a highlight that 15 years ago, 14 years ago, whenever the financial crisis, that was driven by financial institutions, 100% driven by financial institutions. What we're going through today is not driven by financial institutions. Think back to the 14 years ago, Jack Henry, yes, we had some bumps, but the model that we built in is the model that we have today. We did not go out like our major competitors did, we did not pursue merchant acquiring. We have stayed true to our business model, and that business model has proven to be very resilient as the economy kind of goes up and down. It's not that we're not bulletproof, but we have a pretty burn good model here with predictability with more than 90% recurring revenue and that revenue coming from mostly necessary systems at our customer sites, they're not discretionary spend. And so that provides a pretty good layer of protection against changes in the economy. Dominick Gabriele : Great. And then maybe just, Dave, if you can talk about -- maybe update us on your ancillary product attach rate on average for new wins, so the extra products that you attach after or win, how that maybe has changed over the last year or two? And how that attach rate of extra products could change for public cloud wins? David Foss : Yes. So as you know, for our core deals, whenever we sell a core deal, our catch rate is pretty high. We sell a number of solutions along with the core system. As we move to public cloud, I think because we're going to have a number of these complementary solutions also public cloud native, like Financial Crimes Defender that I just highlighted, like Payrailz, and we have other solutions that are already on the public cloud. Because we are -- been pretty forward thinking about ensuring that our complementary solutions fit that same profile of being public cloud native, taking advantage of all the -- all the positives of a public cloud offering. I think that attach rate will remain relatively consistent, maybe greater. I think it's too early for me to predict anything like that. But I think what we've built and the way we've gone about this is to try and ensure that the attach rate remains at least the same as what we've seen in the past. If we had not modernized the complementary solutions, if we had not made the moves to bring them along with the core, I think you would see our attach rate drop significantly because people would say, \u201cWell, you got this public cloud core, but nothing else you're doing is public cloud. Why would I use something that's hosted in a private cloud or that have to run in-house in my back office.\u201d But that's not what we've done. We've been very thoughtful and diligent about making sure that our complementary solutions are coming along with the strategy, either they've been rewritten or written new or acquired like Payrailz so that we have a complete stack offering for our customers when they get to the public cloud point in their evolution. Dominick Gabriele : Excellent. Actually, maybe I could just sneak in one more here. Could you just help us on the growth rate of Payrailz that you're expecting on revenue And then maybe just the full year tax rate that you expect for the total company for 2023? David Foss : I think we'll do tax rate. I don't know that we're prepared to share what the growth rate is going to be on Payrailz at this point. We don't call out individual products when it comes the growth rate of a product. But as far as tax rate is concerned, Mimi... Mimi Carsley : Yes, Dom. I would recommend using 24%. Operator : The next question will come from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Just a couple of quick follow-up questions from me. First, Dave and Mimi maybe both expressed confidence in kind of your deconversion fee revenue and understanding the nature of that revenue. But just wondering, just from a modeling perspective, if where your sense of confidence in getting to that target or that level for this year is? Have you already had notifications and that kind of thing? Or just wondering kind of where that stems from? David Foss : Yes. A good portion of that is known today. So we know of customers who have already been acquired. We know what the deconversion revenue is going to be. It's certainly not 100% is known, but a good chunk of that is known to us today. . James Faucette : Okay. Got it. I suspect it as much, but I just wanted to be sure. And then the second thing I wanted to ask about is on Banno and just some of the things that we've seen and not in your space specifically, but in IT more generally. It's been interesting because we've seen some shifting around between fee versus usage-based models, et cetera. And Banno, in my understanding, is it's primarily priced on a user count basis. How does that stack up against your competitors that a lot of times are using usage or transaction-based models. And is that something that gives you an advantage right now? Or what is your sense on pricing type and the impact on market and ability to win with Banno? David Foss : Yes. So you're correct in that our pricing is tied to registered users. So it's essentially activity because people that have signed up and are using the platform on a regular basis. So I think the concept of registered users and usage are conflated because a registered user who is never using the system, and I forget what the metric is -- six months. If somebody isn't using it for six months, the financial institution doesn't get charged. So registered users and usage are conflated a little bit because there is this active component in the way that customers pay for our solutions. But we're not -- we don't win deals today because of the way we price this. We're winning deals because of the technology and the strategy and the forward-looking nature of what Banno is doing as compared to anybody else in the market. That's what's really driving success for us. So I wouldn't say that our pricing is -- I don't think our solution is cheaper than other people or anything like that. It's the technology and the offering that is helping us to win and continuing to grab great reviews from all corners of our market. Operator : The next question will come from John Davis with Raymond James. John Davis : Dave, a lot of your -- some of your peers and a lot of other kind of enterprise software companies have talked about elongated sales cycles, longer decision-making. Obviously, you reiterated your guide. It doesn't sound like you're seeing any of that. But just curious if you could comment just on what you are seeing, any changes in the landscape whatsoever from a sales cycle perspective? Any color there would be helpful. David Foss : Yes. I've read those reports, JD. I have read the transcripts. We are not seeing that. That is not what Jack Henry's experiencing. I mean you have ups and downs all the time when it comes to individual decisions on individual deals where something may creep into an individual deal. But as far as the overall sales activity, the level of activity, the speed of deals, nothing has changed. John Davis : Okay. And then Mimi, just a quick one for you. Corporate and Other was pretty strong this quarter. Just curious, is that -- was there something kind of onetime in there? Is that kind of the run rate we should expect to just update year-over-year. Mimi Carsley : Thanks, JD, for the question. Nothing that I would say is worthy of a call out. John Davis : Okay, that's a fair kind of run rate. That line has been relatively consistent historically throughout the year. So that's how we should think about it this year? Mimi Carsley : Yes, I agree. John Davis : Okay. And then maybe one for Greg. Payrailz, I just want to understand a little bit more, like, obviously, it looks like you paid about 15x revenue for a business that's losing a decent amount of money. So clearly, you see a huge opportunity here. So I just want to understand like how you ramp this? And how -- why this is so valuable to Jack Henry and like how you can kind of get to like an ROI that makes sense. You guys have historically been very conservative on what you paid for acquisitions. So clearly, there's something huge here. So maybe just a minute or so on what you guys see the potential for Payrailz in Jack Henry? Greg Adelson : Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. I think a couple of things, and we alluded to a little bit earlier. So again, there's an acceleration of what we were doing already in our tech modernization strategy, kind of driving towards the ability to utilize again this payments platform to drive transactions in a variety of different areas. So I already mentioned the open loop P2P, which is very significant. Again, when you look out in the P2P space and look at the alternatives and the cost of those alternatives, it creates a really great option for our clients, our core clients, but also noncore clients to utilize an open-loop solution. So we have some strategies that we're going to be using around that. There's things that we're going to be able to do related to business to consumer payments and B2B payments that we're driving as part of that platform. A lot of lease cost routing options that we didn't have in our old platforms to be able to drive things around there. And then I think one of the other big ones is that they have a pretty sophisticated fraud solution that does real-time P2P fraud. So we're going to be able to utilize that not only into what we're doing with P2P, but also, as Dave has mentioned a couple of times on this call related to Financial Crimes Defender, there's going to be some ability to leverage some of that data, but not only the data but also the technology, the AI technology. into some of the components that we're building there. So there's a whole host of things that drive into our strategy in general that makes this acquisition very appealing and accelerates things that would have taken us a lot longer to do. Operator : The next question will come from Dave Koning with Baird. David Koning : And I had a few more on Payrailz. I guess, first of all, it's in the payments segment, right? David Foss : Correct. David Koning : Okay. Yes. And then secondly, in the $23 million of acquisition costs this year, is some of that nonrecurring stuff? Or is that more of the ongoing normal cost base? Mimi Carsley : Mostly reoccurring, Dave. We can provide a follow-up on the breakout for you. David Koning : Okay. And kind of the -- and the reason partly that I'm asking to get accretive next year, like if we just assume, let's say -- let's just say $20 million of revenue and 50% margins, so that you have $10 million of EBIT. But then between amortization and interest expense, it would just seem like it would be really hard to make that accretive. And I'm just wondering how you're -- like what kind of the formula is to get to accretion? Or maybe you're not including interest expense because you have enough cash over the next year to pay for it anyway? Or maybe just give us a little like on how you get to accretion? David Foss : Yes, go ahead. Mimi Carsley : Yes. I mean it's a good question. I would say we are very focused from our robust diligence models, we feel confident in the ability to get accretive and it will grow. We're doing a lot with the platform. David Foss : So I think -- and let me add this. So I think not only from a revenue growth standpoint, but there are also -- there are some very substantial cost takeouts that can be part of our overlapping contracts related to vendors and the scale that Jack Henry brings to driving opportunities with those. We've already negotiated several of those to be able to lower cost components for them. There's a lot of opportunity within resource allocation and what we're doing across those businesses as well. So all of those were modeled out to be able to get to the point where we feel that we'll be able to be accretive next year. It's a combination of revenue growth and cost takeout that leads to that accretion. It's not strictly based on revenue growth. We are not highlighting or creating a line item or highlighting a line item of what are the cost synergies. But just know, there are fairly significant synergies in this. Operator : The next question will come from Charles Nabhan with Stephens. Charles Nabhan : I wanted to get your comments on a couple of specific products. The first being bill pay, which has been highlighted as an area of weakness by some of your peers and competitors. And the second being fraud, and I know you touched on the new platform. But I wanted to just get a better sense for how you're differentiated in that area, given the number of companies chasing that opportunity. David Foss : Yes. So Chuck, first off, on the bill pay, I know exactly which report you're referring to, and I was surprised at that because we have not seen any slowdown or change. Now the thing I've highlighted several times on these calls is the bill pay isn't growing very fast, but it certainly is not dropping off or shrinking or anything like that. And so I'm -- I was surprised at that -- but that is not what Jack Henry is seeing. Our bill pay is steady, continuing to grow, essentially low single digits. It's not a fast grower, but it's certainly not dropping off as far as the overall opportunity for bill pay. And then the second part of your question, remind me? Mimi Carsley : Fraud. Charles Nabhan : About fraud. David Foss : Yes. So Fraud Defender, our Financial Crimes Defender is, a, it's built on this public cloud native platform that we've been talking about. It is using the latest technology when it comes to fraud detection and it is built with these integration opportunities so that you can run a lot more different types of transactions through the same fraud engine and see different transactions for the same customer coming through a whole bunch of different presentation going to presentation layers. And so it truly is a differentiated solution, not only the technology that it's built on, but the offering, the breadth of the offering is different from what we already have, and we feel strongly different from what anybody else has in the market. And so this will -- time will tell if we have what we think we have, but we have we think, a truly differentiated offering with this new solution. Charles Nabhan : Got it. And just as a quick follow-up. Curious, does the guidance for '23 assume any impact from CPI escalators? Mimi Carsley : Thanks, Chuck. So within our normal construct of our sales cycle and our renewal, we had CPI increases that happened throughout the year. So that's part of our organic plan. Nothing that I would call out specifically. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Please go ahead. Vance Sherard : Thank you, Chuck. We will have an additional investor interaction available from management's participation in the following upcoming investor events : Northcoast Research Fall Forum on November 14; RBC Capital Markets Global Technology Conference on November 16; Stephens Annual Investment Conference on November 17; Credit Suisse 26th Annual Technology Conference on November 29; and finally, NASDAQ's 47th Investor Conference on December 6. We are pleased with the results from operations and remain enthusiastic and focused on our future. We thank all Jack Henry associates for their efforts to produce these results. We appreciate you joining us today. And Chuck, will you please provide the replay number. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I\u2019ll now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vance Sherard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Vance Sherard : Good morning and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry Fiscal 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today is David Foss, Board Chair and CEO; Mimi Carsley, CFO and Treasurer; and Greg Adelson, President and COO. After these opening remarks, I will turn the call over to Dave for his thoughts about the state of our business, financial and sales performance for the quarter, industry comments and other key initiatives. After Dave concludes his comments, Mimi will provide additional commentary regarding the financial results and fiscal year guidance included in the press release issued yesterday that is available from the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website. We will then open the lines for Q&A. As a reminder, this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to multiple factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to multiple risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures are in yesterday's press release. I will now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Vance. And good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our second quarter. For Q2 of fiscal 2023, total revenue increased 2% for the quarter, and increased 6% on a non-GAAP basis. This variance was primarily due to a reduction in deconversion revenue, which I'll detail in a few minutes. Turning to the segments, we again had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue was flat for the quarter but increased by 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment also performed well posting a 3% increase in revenue this quarter and a 6% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We had a very strong quarter on our complementary solutions businesses with a 4% increase in revenue this quarter, and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis. Yesterday's press release included revised guidance which Mimi will outline in her comments. One of the key drivers behind this change in guidance was the actual and forecasted reduction in deconversion revenue for the year. As we disclosed yesterday, deconversion fees are down $20 million year-to-date. And this was the primary driver of the variance in GAAP versus non-GAAP revenue and operating income performance for Q2. As a reminder, we receive deconversion revenue when one of our clients is acquired by another institution and is required to pay us a fee to terminate their contract prior to the end date. I normally referenced this as the revenue you don't want to see because it indicates we've lost a client to M&A. This lack of consolidation by financial institutions is also impacting our services revenue associated with convert and merge activities. Because of the impacts to bank stocks and valuations, M&A is down overall in the banking space, and the experts in the industry don't see any significant rebound for at least a couple of quarters. Of course consolidation is outside of Jack Henry's control and we normally update guidance for deconversion revenue as we become aware of pending M&A activity. The other primary item impacting our guidance is the recent change in consumer spending behavior. Due to economic conditions, consumer card usage is slowing and transactions are shifting from debit to credit. Our card processing business is significantly weighted to debit processing. So we are revising guidance to reflect what we believe to be a temporary economic trend. As I've said many times in the past, our financial model is very resistant to significant swings resulting from changes in the overall economy. But we're not completely bulletproof. Despite the external factors, our primary businesses remain strong and continue to perform very well. As I mentioned in the press release, our sales teams again had an outstanding quarter with a number of notable wins. In fact, Q2 set a new quarterly sales record for Jack Henry breaking the record we set in the June quarter last year. In the second quarter, we inked 12 competitive core takeaways, and an additional 15 deals to move existing in-house core clients to our private cloud environment. December 30, was a particularly memorable day for us to Jack Henry as we signed the three core takeaways of multibillion dollar financial institutions on the same day. We continue to see good success with our new card processing solution, signing 12 new card processing clients this quarter. We also continue to see great success signing clients to our Banno digital suite with 36 new contracts in Q2. Speaking of our digital suite, our Banno business solution is scheduled to go into general release next quarter. We already have 18 institutions live in early adopter status with the feedback being extremely positive from those users. We have 308 clients under contract for the solution, and we're positioned to bring them into full production at a very rapid pace once we achieve general availability. We are also continuing to implement new financial institution clients on the retail Banno platform at a similar pace to recent quarters. At the end of Q2, we surpassed 8.8 million registered users on the platform, and Banno continues to hold one of the highest consumer ratings in the App Store. Normally in January, I share with you the results of bank spending survey projections from the publications we follow closely. Unfortunately, this year, none of those major publications provided forward looking projections around the topic of expected tech spending in the banking segment. I have received a number of smaller surveys, and we conducted our own informal survey at a banking CEO roundtable last month with the results being all relatively consistent. The average increase appears to be settling at around 7% for calendar 2023, with the most popular range being a 5% to 10% increase. I'll continue to watch for firm objective data and we'll share as it becomes available. As you may have noticed last month, we took a major step forward with our environmental efforts by signing a commitment letter indicating our intention to set science-based climate targets with the Science Based Targets Initiative or SBTI. Science Based Targets are aligned with the level of decarbonization necessary to meet the goals of the Paris agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels. Jack Henry will pursue validation for near term greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets through SBTI. This commitment follows extensive analysis and discussion and is supported by our low carbon transition plan which outlines several mitigation tactics to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. More information regarding this plan will be disclosed in our next sustainability report, which will be released on March 31 through the investor site on Jack henry.com. As you will recall, it was on this call last year that we announced our new technology monetization strategy. We developed this multiyear strategy to help us deliver the public cloud native capabilities to Community and Regional financial institutions, allowing them to innovate, compete and meet the evolving needs of their account holders. We are continuing to make great progress on the strategies four main objectives. First, we're redefining the core processing system by unbundling services that traditionally would be in the core and building them as standalone modules on the public cloud. In September, we announced plans to build these services on the Google Cloud. And we've been testing our wire processing and authorization management services modules on the Google Cloud since that time. We currently have six clients live in early adopter status with domestic wires, and plan to offer general availability for this solution in July. We expect to launch the international wire solution for early adopters in April and expect that module to be generally available late in the fourth calendar quarter this year. Second, we're working to provide multiple data integration options utilizing our open philosophy and technology. Our newest offering in this area is real time data streaming, simultaneous, constant streaming of necessary data to all systems on the platform. We're currently in beta with real time data streaming, which is essential to support real time payments and fraud detection. We expect this functionality to go into live production later in this calendar year. Delivering industry leading capabilities across a single next generation platform is the third objective. Banno was a key element in this part of the strategy. But we're working on several other additional solutions to build upon this commitment. As an example, in September, we added Payrailz, a public cloud native digital payments platform to our suite of payment solutions. Additionally, this summer we're launching Financial Crimes defender, our next-gen Financial Crimes platform with enhanced capabilities, including machine learning, and artificial intelligence. This new fraud solution has been built entirely on our public cloud native platform. The last step in the strategy is to move from acting as a core processor to offering a full banking ecosystem. This includes our own capabilities, plus access to leading fintechs through a single platform that prioritizes openness, agility, speed, and optionality. A year ago, I announced that we had more than 850 FinTech providers in our ecosystem, today is closer to 950 and the number continues to grow. We're also the only platform provider that has relationships with all four major financial data aggregators, Finicity, Plaid, Yodlee, and Akoya. Through these companies, financial institutions can give account holders a complete financial picture in a safe secure manner that eliminates screen scraping. We've seen strong interest in this strategy from both prospects and customers. Anecdotally, I can tell you that we are currently in conversations with a number of prospects, who have indicated that the technology modernization strategy I just described is the primary driver for them to engage with Jack Henry to help develop their technology strategy for the future. Community and Regional financial institutions are the lifeblood of mainstream America. Many of them, however, are at a crossroads. The personal service and experience they are known for is being disrupted by technology as nontraditional financial service providers have entered the market. And the way people bank has fundamentally changed especially for the younger generation. As a well-rounded financial technology company, Jack Henry is in a unique position to provide modern technology and services to help community and regional financial institutions capitalize on this opportunity and strengthen connections with their account holders. The key takeaway is that while we're successfully meeting the needs of our clients today, as shown by our performance results, we're also preparing them for the future. We're pleased with the progress we've made on this exciting strategy. And we'll share more updates at our Investor Day in May. As we began the second half of our fiscal year, our sales pipeline is very robust, and we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our clients, our ability to expand the client relationships, the spending environment, and our long-term prospects for success. With that, I'll turn it over Mimi Carsley for some detail on the numbers. Mimi Carsley : Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. As highlighted by Dave\u2019s comments, Jack Henry had a successful second quarter and I will discuss the details driving those results. Total revenue is up 2% for the quarter on a GAAP basis and solidly up 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Fiscal year-to-date, GAAP revenue was up 5% and non-GAAP revenue increased 7%. So let's jump into the details. on a GAAP basis services and support revenue decreased 2% in the second quarter, but increased 3% year-to-date. Services and support were negatively impacted as deconversion revenue decreased $21 million for the quarter, $20 million year-to-date. This is consistent with the broader market lack of acquisition activity in our space. We now anticipate approximately $15 million in deconversion revenue this fiscal year. However, forecasting deconversion revenue remains challenging given the limited advance notice and the general uncertain nature of M&A. Our private and public cloud offerings showed robust growth this quarter, growing 11% and 10% year-to-date. Product delivery and services decreased 26% in the quarter, impacted by lower deconversion fees and convert merge activity offset by slightly higher implementation related revenue. As a reminder, user group conference related to a major customer conference shifted into Q1 this year contributing to the year-over-year Q2 revenue decline. Year-to-date, product delivery and services revenue decreased 11% influenced by similar drivers as the quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, services and support revenue grew 6% for the quarter, and 7% year-to-date, which serves to highlight our consistently fundamental business stress. Processing revenue increased 9% on a GAAP basis for both the quarter and year-to-date. On a non-GAAP basis, the growth was 7% for the quarter, and 8% year-to-date, the increases were largely driven by higher card volumes, despite a slight increase in the rate of growth. Additionally, digital revenue continues to show rapid growth led by robust demand for Banno Digital platforms. Now turning to cost, cost of revenue was up 8% for both the quarter and year-to-date. Quarterly drivers included increased card processing costs consistent with card revenue growth, higher personnel costs, and amortization expense. These drivers are consistent across our year-to-date results. Research and development expense increased 22% for the quarter, mostly due to higher personnel costs and licensing fee. Year-to-date, these expenses increased 23% based on the same factors. SG&A was 2% driven by increases in personnel, travel, professional services, partly offset by the gain on sale of assets. Year-to-date, the increase was 7% influenced by similar drivers. The quarter and the remainder of the year benefit from disciplined focus and actions involving facility rationalization, headcount and travel control, procurement wins and other expense management. These collective efforts help to offset inflationary pressures and mitigate lower revenue. As we previously mentioned, some compensation and travel related cost increases result from the lower cost comparisons from our first half of fiscal 2022. Due to previously mentioned management rigor on cost controls, we concluded Q2 with strong operational results. Despite net income declining 16% primarily due to deep lower deconversion fees and increased interest expense, the quarter saw a fully diluted earnings per share of $1.10. Our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter and year-to-date are consistent with internal expectations and set us up for a strong finish to fiscal year \u201823. As a reminder, for transparency, the impact from the gain on the sale of assets, including this quarter sale of an Albuquerque property, yielding a $1.2 million gain to Payrailz acquisition and deconversion fees are shown as part of non-GAAP adjustments in the press release. Turning our attention to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $191 million for the year-to-date down from $197 million for the same period last year, essentially due to lower deconversion revenue. Total R&D investment remain slightly elevated, which should normalize by next fiscal year. Free cash flow which is operating cash flow less CapEx and cap software less proceeds from the sale of assets was $119 million. We remain committed to maintaining ample operating liquidity, reinvesting for growth, evaluating financially sound strategic acquisitions, paying dividends, and opportunistically repurchasing our stock. This consistent dedication to value creation resulted in a trailing 12 month return on invested capital of 21.4%. Focusing ahead, let me discuss updated guidance. The press release included revised GAAP and non-GAAP full year guidance. The GAAP guidance remains inclusive of Payrailz acquisition, gain on asset sales and deconversion fees. We expect the trends impacting Q2 results to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year impacting both GAAP and non-GAAP results. Most significantly, assuming minimal industry consolidation, deconversion fees will likely remain muted at approximately $15 million for the fiscal year, representing a $20 million decrease from our previous guidance. Second, languishing bank M&A related consolidation negatively impacted our outlook for our convert merge services revenue for the fiscal year. As a reminder, this revenue is driven by our clients acquiring and implementing Jack Henry solutions at their newly purchased institution. Finally, in line with announced payment network activity, we're experiencing a slower rate of growth and anticipated for debit transaction volumes in our card processing business, primarily driven by a combination of lower consumer spending and the spending shift to credit card. As a reminder, card processing is approximately 22% of our total revenue. And as Dave highlighted more heavily weighted to debit card business. As a result of these impacts, GAAP revenue growth for fiscal \u201823 is now expected to be 5.4% to 5.8%. Guidance for non-GAAP revenue growth is now 7% to 7.3%. Outlook full year GAAP operating margin is now approximately 22.9%, which is negatively impacted by the expected lower deconversion fees and is inclusive of the impact from both gain on sale of assets and the Payrailz acquisition. Full year non-GAAP operating margin guidance due to strong management expense control is now expected to deliver slightly margin improvement for the fiscal year compared to previous guidance of flat to slightly down. The management team remains focused on returning to margin expansion in fiscal \u201824. Full year GAAP EPS guidance is now a range of $4.79 to $4.83. The midpoint of $4.81 is an $0.11 decrease from previous guidance, even though those lower deconversion fees drive the $0.20 reduction. The headwind caused by lower deconversion fees is mitigated by the team's collaborative and disciplined cost control, gain on sale of assets and lower net income. We expect the remainder of fiscal year \u201823 quarterly non-GAAP revenue growth momentum to deliver increases in both in the third and fourth quarters to achieve our revised full year guidance targets. We anticipate similar growth patterns for non-GAAP operating margin delivering the revised increased full year guidance. So in closing, we delivered another quarter of strong operational and fiscal result and remain solidly optimistic about the success of our business model. We thank all of our investors for their continued confidence in Jack Henry. Keith, will you please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Vasundhara Govil with KBW. Vasundhara Govil : Hi, thank you for taking my question. I guess the first question on just the non-GAAP revenue weakness, it seems like most of that is basically related to the payment segment with more shift from debit to credit spending. Any changes anticipated in any other segments based on what you were thinking before? And then Dave, just for you. Any update on macro, I know you're sort of still seeing good momentum in new client signs. But has anything changed in the quarter in terms of bank decision making for new deals? Whether it's taking more time to close deals or the size of deals that you were seeing just any update there would be super helpful. David Foss : I'll take the second part first, Vasu, and then I'll turn it over Mimi. As far as the overall macroenvironment, I would say things are continuing to look very strong. Our pipeline, I just mentioned in my prepared remarks that we set another sales record in Q2 which I was not expecting, given the huge performance we saw in Q4, the June quarter last year. So to set another overall sales performance record was a surprise to me. But the environment is very strong, the pipeline is larger than it's ever been. I would say that on the core side of the business, we are trending larger. So I highlighted, we assigned three-multibillion-dollar institutions on December 30th alone, core takeaways December 30th. And I think the if you look at the core side of the business, the accounts that we're currently involved in are definitely trending larger, bigger institutions coming to Jack Henry looking to make a change. I certainly believe part of that is driven by the technology modernization strategy. They're looking for that partner that will really help them modernize. But I think the other driver for that is just the reputation Jack Henry has for delivering great technology and great service. So I would characterize the overall environment for us as far as sales is very strong right now. And as I said in my prepared remarks, although we don't have any of the big surveys that I can quote, because nobody has published results. I have a whole bunch of more anecdotal bits of feedback and that CEO roundtable that I hosted two weeks ago in Phoenix, and they're the kind of average spend increase for calendar \u201823 and this is them knowing that their budgets are in place for \u201923 already. So it's them quoting to me what they have planned, the average was around 7%, as far as an expected spend increase. And by the way, this CEO forum that I hosted was not just Jack Henry core customers. This was a variety of CEOs from a variety of, who are running a variety of different solutions. So that would be my comment on the overall and I'll turn it over Mimi, to answer your first part of your question. Mimi Carsley : Thanks, Vasu, for the question. I would say on a non-GAAP revenue change. Yes, I think you're right in terms of predominantly is around card which is based on that we were optimistic in terms of now the slowing consumer is a little bit slower than we anticipated. And so I think that's led to a modest deceleration of growth, but still an attractive growth rate, I would call out. And so it's predominantly around cards. David Foss : I think that's important to emphasize that our growth rate year-over-year is for the payments business is very strong. Now we've backed off a little bit because what's happening in consumer behavior, but we should not lose sight of the fact that the payments business is up significantly year-over-year as far as overall growth. Vasundhara Govil : That's super helpful. And if I may ask the follow up on Banno, I know, there are a number of new players out there that are trying to sell digital banking and to bank some of them who might be your core customers. But I was just curious, when you go to sell Banno, and it's a competitive deal, like what sort of win rate do you see typically, for your product? And then have you started to sell Banno outside of your core base of clients already? And if not, what's the roadmap for that? David Foss : Yes, so I don't think, Vasu, I can quote you accurately on what our win rate is. And I think pretty much every deal where we're selling digital banking is a competitive deal. So I couldn't quote you an accurate percentage as far as what our win rate. Win rate is, I just know it's very high because Banno has this outstanding reputation. As far as selling outside the base, so, we're from a technology point of view, we're prepared to do that right now. It's a strategy point of view that has kind of prompted us to back off a little bit. And I think I talked about this on a previous call. We see opportunities outside the base, as I said, from a technical point of view, ready to deliver outside the base. But we have learned that for some of our competitors are selling into their base, they perceive to be a real positive a real win, because it gives them a better solution overall. And so we're weighing the opportunity for us to sell Banno versus the potential negative for us in selling the core side. If a competitor says, oh, my gosh, wait, we finally abandoned in our base now. So our customers won't be as likely to leave us on the core side of the business. That's not necessarily a good thing for Jack Henry. So we're being very strategic about how we position this and which core basis we go after. And I'd rather err on the side of making sure the strategy is right. And rather than just chasing after a few dollars that might damage us long term from a strategic point of view. Operator : And the next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Dave, given you completed the transition of processing over the first data, which used in their back end for debit and credit card processing, are you able to leverage their capability at all to build out your credit card processing capacity to offset some of the shift from a debit to credit? David Foss : Yes, certainly, we're able to use that platform. And we already have customers in production on the credit side and customers that we've signed. But as I've highlighted and others settings it's not a matter of going to a customer and saying, hey, we have credit, now you want to sign up, they have if they're in the credit space, they already have an agreement with somebody. And so normally they need to allow that agreement to anniversary all step to buy the contract out. The other thing that I've been pretty transparent about on these calls, is we've been building up our expertise in the credit space. Credit is a different business from debit. We needed to literally hire people to sell, hire people to service, that side of the business. And so we've been building up that capability overtime. So it's combination of those things that has been kind of a slow roll for us as far as being in the credit space. But as far as being positioned today to offer credit when a customer is ready to get into the credit space. We have the programs, we have a sales organization, we have the technical abilities to deliver. And so it's a matter of us finding those customers and converting them. David Togut : Understood. And then on the tech modernization strategy, do you have specific timelines to roll out some of the key initial modules to clients? David Foss : Yes, we do. And so and we publish that for our clients, we have a roadmap out on our customer portal so our clients can go and see what the roadmap looks like. And so we're being very transparent with our clients and with prospects. Initially, I had hoped to publish that for everybody to see. But we've realized that, again, competitors are very, very eager to see what Jack Henry's doing. They're trying to figure out how to compete with a strategy. And so we backed off on being quite that transparent. But we're being very transparent with our existing customers, and with prospects who are looking at tech modernization to help define their strategy for the future. David Togut : We don't have access to the client portal, I mean, can you kind of share in any broad brushstrokes, what we should be expecting in terms of rollout of tech modernization strategy? David Foss : Yes, I'll, so I'm going to turn it over to Greg here. Just to give you a couple of highlights, again, we're not going to go into great detail at this point. But Greg can give you a couple of highlights of what to expect. And I will point out that in the, my prepared remarks here, I highlighted the fact that we have some of these things rolling out. We have our domestic wire solution coming into full production here in just a couple of months. We have our international wire solution coming into full production later this year. So I've already highlighted a few of those things. But I'll turn it over to Greg for a little more color. Greg Adelson : Yes, there's a few other things we're doing. So we basically have planned out for the next three years. So we have various targets that we've assessed, but things around authorization management is a big one. Dave actually mentioned that as some of the testing that we're doing already, in the Google Cloud, that's a big one, there's a lot of components that we're doing with real time to help us with some solutions that we're going to look to roll out over the next 18 months or so that we're not prepared to talk about publicly, but components of that. And then, of course, a lot of the other key modules, General Ledger itself, other components that will be done. But each of those is already bracketed by year for what we plan to get done over the next three years. David Togut : Got it. And just finally, the three big core wins, you signed on December 30. Dave. What were the key to those wins, like what particular capability drove those wins? And how big were those banks? Were they above $10 billion in assets? David Foss : None of them were above $10 billion. My recollection is they were mostly been a three-ish range. three to five, somewhere in there. And I'm not, I'm just doing that off top my head, but somewhere in that range for those customers. And I think it's the same story that you've heard from us time and time again, Dave. It's a combination of great technology, a great reputation for service, a very focused strategy. So if you come to do business with Jack Henry, you know which core side we're going to be supporting for the go forward. There's no question about what our strategy is regarding core. So I think it's all those things rolled together, plus, this reputation we have for openness. And today, most banks and credit unions want to connect to FinTech solutions, and they want a partner who embraces that idea of open connectivity. And so you roll all those things together. It's the same things that we've been talking about for a long time. Those are the primary drivers for us in these wins. Operator : And then last question come from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Hey, good morning. Dave in the past, we've talked about maybe the backlog in the business. I know you don't report that. But the one way I know you kind of look at revenue and your ability to kind of projected backlog of installed teams and seems as though you've been winning a lot. If you kind of look at that metric, over the next maybe 12-18 months, is that still look very good and give you confidence from a revenue standpoint? David Foss : Yes, we actually have a report card that I look at every month, that shows the number of we refer to as a slot. So the number of conversion slots, the number of conversions that we're prepared to do in any given quarter. And it shows how many of those slots are already booked, how many of them are being held, because there's a deal that's in process where a customer has said, hey, I want to convert to nine months as opposed to 18 months, and then how many are open. And our backlog on the core side is well into the next fiscal year as far as those slots being held. Now, once in a while when I say things like that people will say, well, hey, you ought to just go hire more people and speed that up. The thing you have to remember is this isn't about hiring more people. And we can do a conversion in a month. Conversion when you're doing an entire core conversion. Normally you plan for 12 months and that's not because Jack Henry so slow, we can't do it any faster. It's because there is so much to be absorbed on the customer side. They're trying to run the bank or credit union and at that same time, they're learning all new systems and all new processes and they are validating data to be converted, and it's just a very large, massive project. And so we manage our backlog really well, I think our conversion team has managed the backlog well. We do a similar exercise for every other product that we have. The core backlog is the one that normally gets a lot of attention. But every product we have, we have that exercise and that reporting. And so we can staff up and staff down as we need to, generally fairly easily certainly, there are some roles that are very specialized and you can't simply move people from one group and not to another based on demand. But generally, we can do that pretty easily and manage our backlog effectively. Kartik Mehta : And then just one of the issues that you always hear banks talk about especially maybe community banks and credit unions is having to deal with fraud, whether it's fraud related to P2P payments, or fraud related to their ATM business or checking accounts. And I'm wondering from Jack Henry's perspective, how you might be able to help your customers and how that might help Jack Henry in terms of selling products. Greg Adelson : Yes, Kartik, this is Greg, I'll take that one. So a couple things. So even in the Payrailz acquisition, we have a fraud module that we're actually rolling out with our open loop P2P. So again, it provides an extra layer of fraud protection for that, actually, there's a unlike sale which is it revocable and a couple of the other faster payment solutions, there's an option as when the receiver gets it to designate how they want to receive the payment. And as part of that process, we have an extra kind of fraud layer there. The other thing as Dave mentioned our Financial Crimes Defender products, that one is going to be specifically tailored for the opportunity to help with both sell fraud, and other Faster Payments fraud, because it's got real time components to it. And so those will be two things. We're actually in beta right now, with the Financial Crimes Defender product, and it is getting significantly, really good fanfare from our clients in the beta process. So we're pretty excited. But those are just two of several other things. We actually have a committee here at Jack Henry, that we kind of aggregate all of our kind of defense projects, fraud products. And we have a team that is looking to kind of consolidate some of that and drive the right strategy for our customers. Operator : And the next question comes from John Davis of Raymond James. John Davis : Hey, good morning, guys. Mimi, just on the updated EPS guide. It looks like the better margin on a non-GAAP basis kind of offset a little bit weaker revenue. And then the deconversion fees looks like it'd be about $0.20 hit EPS, but you only took down the midpoint by $0.11. So just curious that our tax rate or anything goes in line or anything else that drives that kind of smaller EPS asset. Mimi Carsley : Yes, thanks for the question. JD, you're right, in terms of the deconversion revenue driving about $0.20. If it were to stand on its own. A couple of things, one, to just follow on to my prepared remarks. The disciplined focus on expense controls, and the second half is driving part of that upside. Additionally, we are seeing because of the higher interest rates, we are seeing some positivity from an interest income perspective, that's helping as well. And then on a GAAP basis, you have the Albuquerque sale, as well. So that's just not a lot of changes on the tax rate. But just between management control, and a little bit of interest rate savings. So I would say that\u2019s a primary driver of that change. David Foss : I'm glad you call that out, JD, because I think the as Mimi just detailed, there are several things in there. But the primary driver of that difference between the $0.20 and the $0.11 is management expense control. We have a team here who has really dug in to make sure that we're doing the right things on the expense side. And so if it were just for the slowdown and deconversion revenue, we'd see a $0.20 hit, but the team has really put in the extra effort to make sure that we're doing the right things here. And I think that's a significant call out for the management team at Jack Henry. John Davis : Okay, thanks. And then the second half implied guide is a little very modest step up implies growth a little over 7%. Any callouts, Mimi, 3Q versus 4Q, should be relatively consistent. Just trying to think about cadence of revenue growth in the back half of the year. Mimi Carsley : Yes, it's a good question, JD. I mean, I would say in similar to our comments last quarter, that the first half is slower and we see a pickup as the year goes on, both from a revenue with Q2 expect it to have been our lowest quarter and growing as the year continues. So I wouldn't say that there's a dramatic difference between 3Q and Q4, but just a second half favorability versus first half. John Davis : Okay, thanks. And then, Dave, on the debit card revenue, I think I was called out. It's about 22% of revenue. Can you help us think about what's an account on file fee versus per transaction? Just trying to understand it, if macro slows further, it gets better how sensitive that card business is to spending levels? David Foss : Yes, that type of detail is not something that we've disclosed. I think the best way for us to, for you all to track what's happening in our business is just the overall macroenvironment kind of falling what's happening in the overall macro environment. This is not unique to Jack Henry, this is what's happening overall, it's consistent with what's been reported by the major card vendors of MasterCard and Visa. And I think that's the best way to kind of anticipate what's happening at Jack Henry, what's happening overall in the industry, because we follow the industry when it comes to things like debit volume, and any kind of shift between debit and credit. John Davis : Okay, let's take one last one in here, free cash flow conversion, trailing 12 months is down a little bit relative to history for Jack, somewhere in the 80s versus the 100% or so target. Any false there on timing, do you still comfortable with getting back to 100% for the full year for free cash flow conversion? Mimi Carsley : Yes, I think you're right, JD, in terms to look at it on a longer cycle, I wouldn't recommend looking at on a quarter but rather on a year-to-date. And so on a Q1 because of the timing of Q1versus Q2, year-to-date, this year, we're about $119 million versus prior year $96 million. That's with asset sales without pretty comparable, if you wouldn't adjust for deconversion revenue, we'd be pretty comparable on a six-month basis. So I think all-in-all, I think not a lot to kind of call out for the second half there. I think trends will kind of continue to normalize. Operator : And the next question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning, this has been Ben Bargo on Ken. Thank you for taking my questions. So firstly, I wanted to ask about Payrailz. It looks like the asset generate about $2.5 million of revenue in the second quarter. And you're guiding to $12 million for the year. So I would love to get an update on the performance in the quarter. And kind of what drives the assumption behind the implies step up into second half. John Davis : Yes, so from a sales perspective, we're starting to really see some nice wins, a little bit slower than we had hoped to kind of start out the first few months, but we're starting to pick that up. We're also through the integration efforts that we've been doing, we're able to sell some separate modules. So some of those components that we bought from Payrailz, we can actually sell into our existing iPay business. So the open loop P2P that we mentioned the A to A components and even the fraud module, we're able to sell. So we're starting to get that geared up, we're completing some integration. So we're pretty bullish that we're going to have an opportunity to continue to sell into the iPay space as well as what we have in the prospect list for the Payrailz customers pre acquisition and post. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That makes sense. And secondly, just as we think about your guidance, how should we expect the update targets to really flow through the segment results in 3Q and 4Q? Is it expected to spread out evenly? Or where are you expecting the biggest impact relative to the prior guide? Mimi Carsley : I can take that one, Ben. So I would say year-to-date trends that we've seen core being about six driven mostly by cloud strength, payments up about 7% growth and complementary about 8%, for the full year and that's on a non-GAAP basis, for the full year, we're seeing some consistency in those trends. So I would say particularly around core and payments consistently full year versus kind of year-to-date. And on complementary, I think growing slightly in the second half to kind of land us up a little bit there. So that's kind of the direction I would call out. Operator : And the next question comes from Rayna Kumar with UBS. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is a D J Kulkarni filling in Karina Kumar. Thanks for taking my question. I guess to start it. I appreciate the details on the tech modern strategy but can you touch on how this is progressing and particularly if there are any notable developments on this front within the payments business since the acquisition of Payrailz? And then I have a follow up. David Foss : So Payrailz is part of the strategy. The idea was that by acquiring Payrailz, we acquire a public cloud native bill pay and overall payments platform that does P2P account to account and business to business payments. And so acquiring Payrailz was to kind of fill that need for a public cloud native payments platform. Our choices were to essentially rewrite iPay and add functionality to iPay, or go acquire something that was already public cloud native and integrated into the solution. So as Greg just highlighted Payrailz is up and running, integration work is being completed, but not much left to do as far as integrating into the rest of solution in the public cloud environment that we've created. So it's progressing beautifully, as far as I'm concerned, from a technology point of view. Unidentified Analyst : Great. That's very helpful. And for my follow up, you mentioned Jack Henry began leaning more on CPI Escalators last year, as inflation climbed to kind of record levels. Now there's expectations of inflation to moderate in 2023, could you just walk us through how this could impact Jack, Henry's business, if at all? David Foss : Well, at this point, we're continuing to implement CPI Escalator. So I stressed two calls ago, I think that's not a one and done thing at Jack Henry, we don't do that at one time. And then we're done doing that, as contracts come up for renewal, those CPI Escalators are implemented for those customers. And we're continuing to do that. So until we see some significant change in the overall economy, we are going to continue to implement those changes to the level that we think is appropriate and that our customers are expecting, we'll continue to implement CPI Escalators. We just did another batch last week. And so this is not something that we're kind of evaluating as a point in time that we're going to stop or that we're going to do something different. We're continuing to do the activities that we've been doing. And we'll do that until we see some change in the overall economy that warrants a change in our practice. Mimi Carsley : The only add on I would say there is it's quite early from a fiscal \u201824. We haven't even started it budget cycle planning. So in terms of being able to indicate utilization, and for next year, I think it's premature. I would say we're not reliant on that as a core strategy of our growth though. Operator : And the next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Hey, good morning. Thank you so much, Dave, Mimi. Wanted to get your perspective a little bit on the prospect for vendor consolidation in the current environment. I guess I'm wondering if I'm a bank or credit union today, I'm using Jack Henry for core processing, but in past have elected to do best-of-breed software from other lending partners. Am I looking to consolidate those activities in some form or fashion? And how does that give you, what does that do for your sales and sales cycle, et cetera? If that is doing. David Foss : Yes, that's a really interesting topic, James. And I could probably talk for about two hours on this one, I won't, but I could. So what's happening right now. So there are a couple of competing forces here when it comes to talking about that. First off, you have a real desire among banks and credit unions to continue to look for best-of-breed solutions. It's why we have so many best-of-breed products in the Jack Henry product family, it was the whole basis for the ProfitStars initiative that we ran until we just changed our branding here, we still have all those solutions, we still have that strategy, we still have a salesforce that only calls on customers outside the Jack Henry core base. That is still a wonderful business for Jack Henry, because there are those customers who demand and expect best-of-breed solutions to connect into their core. At the same time, you have regulators that are pushing pretty hard on those same customers to say you shouldn't be trying to manage so many vendors, you're introducing more risk into your environment, if you have so many different vendor partnerships. And so part of our strategy has been we can do both, we can be the best-of-breed provider for somebody who's not running a Jack Henry core. They limit the number of vendors they work with by working with Jack Henry on non-core solutions because we have such a broad suite of non-core solutions. So we are a positive in that sense to those vendors or for those customers who are looking to do best-of-breed but limit the number of vendors that they're working with. But again, there is this real push because of the disruptive factors or disruptive forces that are happening in the banking space in general. There is this real push among bankers to find those FinTech solutions, those best-of-breed solutions to offer to their clients. And so it's that balancing act, but it's something that we've been watching for quite some time. I feel strongly that Jack Henry is really well positioned to serve both ends of that spectrum. And is part of the reason why we continue to look for some of those best-of-breed solutions to acquire, like Payrailz, so that we can continue to be a force among those customers looking for best-of-breed. James Faucette : Got it. And I wanted to ask also, I guess, a more specific product related question. And that's related to FedNow, given how close you are to FedNow, as I was hoping you could give us an idea of the general readiness and implementation capabilities that the regional community banks that you work with, have to implement that and start to use FedNow. And I guess on a high level, what's your take on the timeline on how JHA PayCenter is positioned to accommodate the roll out? Thanks. Greg Adelson : Hey, James, this is Greg, I'll take that one. So a couple of things. So one, we are positioned to be the first processor live starting in July. So we've been working with the Fed for over two years directly on kind of preparedness for that. So we will be launching it looks like somewhere between 25 and 30 institutions will be part of our initial launch. So the interest level with the community institutions is very high. Part of the reason why is that the clearing house is owned by the larger banks. And so there's always been a little bit of a of a concern about doing business with the larger banks, but with the Fed, the smaller community banks are very excited about this specially about some of the use cases that are being talked about. So, in short, it just as a reminder, we have about 60% of the clearing house institutions, or Jack Henry institutions today, if you look at the who's live with about 60% are Jack Henry. So we will be the first processor going live with the FedNow product in the summer. Operator : And the next question comes from Cris Kennedy with William Blair. Cris Kennedy : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I know credits a small percentage of your overall business today. But can you talk about the agent program that you guys launched in January? And how meaningful that could be? Greg Adelson : Yes, this, Greg, I'll take that one as well. So we did just launch it, we have three customers that are in some type of pilot with us right now since we just got it going. But what we really believe is going to happen is that the smaller community institutions that were had credit programs or wanted to be part of credit programs, they didn't have the staffing or expertise to handle the full-service solution. So just like Dave mentioned that we were gearing up, and we brought in people to help us with it, they didn't have the resources as well. So we really believe the agent program is going to be a nice opportunity for more folks to take advantage of a credit offering. And the way we position the solution set is that at some point in time, if they would like to actually move to a full-service solution, we will let them take that portfolio with them. So that's also pretty advantageous. So again, more to come on that. But we do believe that this -- there'll be more uptake in the agent program, then maybe, especially in the smaller community, institution space. Cris Kennedy : Great, very helpful. And then just a follow up on Payrailz. It's a little bit slower than initially expected. But do you still anticipating it to be accretive next year that dilution going away? Greg Adelson : Yes, we're still working through that. But yes, I mean, we're working through everything we can do related on the sales side, making sure that the sales engine is going to the point that we need it to. And as long as that happens, we feel very confident about that. Operator : And the next question comes from David Koning with Baird. David Koning : Yes. Hey, guys, thank you. And I guess first of all the non-GAAP revenue. I know you took down the year by $20 million to $25 million. And you walk through that, but EBIT, you mentioned too is still non-GAAP EBIT, still stable, meaning you're taking the $20 million to $25 million of cost out -- with cost controls. I guess I'm wondering where are you taking costs out and then is that sustainable into next year? Or will some of that just flux back up as you grow into next year? Mimi Carsley : So, Dave, I think that's a great question. I think it's a combination of factors. I think the discipline focus, as Dave mentioned, previously, we look on every headcount renewal, every ask on it like a roll by roll. There are some more postponing, there's some work just kind of eliminating completely some may dribble back in next year, we're making kind of mindful choices, travels and other example where we are just kind of being disciplined about the amount of travel. But that may not be a structural kind of long term. So I suspect some of that might come back. But then there's other factors, including performance management, and other things that are -- that will help us this year. Greg Adelson : This is great. I'll add one piece, we have a very strong focus on process automation here. Not only tools, but just in people. So about 25% of our staff is really certified in some level of what we call caught in the classroom. And so as part of that, we've been driving a lot of operational savings, and some of the headcount reductions as part of our initiatives to be better automated, and various things that we do. So that's also another contributing factor. David Foss : And that's something that will go on forever at Jack Henry. David, I think the key point there is that what Greg just highlighted, that isn't a one and done exercise, that's something we're trying to ensure is embedded in our culture going forward. We'll continue to look for those opportunities. Always. David Koning : Got you, thank you. And maybe just a follow up, I know Payrailz, I know the year is supposed to be $12 million and Q2 was like $2.6 million or something. But the rest of your needs to be $4.2 million per quarter to get to the full year. And I'm wondering why does it step up from $2.6 million up to $4.2 million per quarter the rest of the years or something seasonal et cetera? David Foss : Yes, there are a couple of decent sized deals out there that we're working on. And feeling pretty good about. So that's part of it. And again, it's also getting these add on solutions, what we call add on solutions to the iPay business, and moving those on. And that's really where a lot of that is baked. Operator : And the next question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Hey, guys. Hey, everybody. Thank you for taking my question. So could you just talk about the demand for and forgive me, I missed the beginning of the call. Can you just talk about the demand for Jack Henry core and the sentiment around the tech modernization and uptake of interest in your conversations with potential new and existing clients versus conversation, say six months ago? David Foss : Yes, so it's becoming a significant part of many of the conversations. So I highlighted the beginning of the call Dominick, that we signed 12 new core deals in the quarter, it was a significant call out that I made, there was three of them were multibillion dollar institutions that all signed on December 30th. So December 30th was kind of a fun day around here. But the other thing that I've talked about already on the call is the fact that we have larger institutions, I think overall demand is moving larger. And I think some of that is definitely being driven by the technology modernization story. So we have, it's become a part of most conversations with core prospects is not necessarily part of the conversation with people who are not looking to bring their core to Jack Henry, but for core prospects, it certainly is part of the conversation, usually. And we are trending up as far as the size of customers that are coming to Jack Henry wanting to talk about tech modernization, because they've been looking for that company that will help them develop a strategy in the future that gets them to the public cloud. And it's a more, I think, rational strategy about how you do the core side of the business, and tie in FinTech solutions, complementary solutions into that experience for their customers. So conversations have been great. I personally have been involved in a lot of them, because as I\u2019ve stressed before when it's a larger institution, and the CEO wants to be in the conversation. I am normally involved in those and it's pretty fun right now. Dominick Gabriele : Right, great. And I actually had one of a really large card provider admit to me that they just can't keep up with the investment that's being provided to modernize these tech stacks, with you and some of your largest peers. So they made a switch to do so. If I just think about the complementary growth and the kind of how it slowed a little bit and then other comments around the second half and also deconversion fee expectations. Do you think that some of that would suggest that there is some level of tech spend retrenching at some of the FIs versus previously as they kind of look at the macro-outlook and try on to the cash that they have. Do you think that's fair? David Foss : Well, so what I talked about in the early part of the call is we don't have any of the major surveys that I can quote to you this year, but I have a number of smaller surveys with smaller sample sizes. And then I hosted the CEO roundtable discussion just two weeks ago. And these were CEOs of larger institutions. Jack Henry core and not. So it was a variety of CEOs and kind of the overall feel. And these are people who have their budgets in place now for 2023. So they weren't speculating. They were sharing with me real numbers that they planned for 2023. The kind of the average settled in at around 7%, their expected increase for 2023. And that's in line with what we're seeing in the sales organization. The sales pipeline is very robust, larger than it's ever been. So I don't see any slowdown or any kind of pullback when it comes to the commitment that folks in our space have on continuing to spend in the technology area. Dominick Gabriele : Great. Sorry, I missed that commentary. Maybe just one last one. Have you seen the pace about just from that further -- beginning comment I made about a large FI outsourcing? Are you seeing more higher pace of outsourcing than you have in the past versus, say, like six months ago with client willingness to outsource their tech capabilities? That's speeding up, or do you think it's fairly stable in the last few years, the willingness? David Foss : Yes, I'd say it's pretty stable. I've described it before as a religious conversation. When you talk to a bank or credit union, they either believe in being in-house with either everything or some things, or they believe in outsourcing, and they just have this kind of ingrained belief. And normally it requires some driver that has nothing to do with Jack Henry to get them to talk about outsourcing. So it might be that they've lost somebody in their tech group that they were very dependent on and now and they can't hire a replacement. It might be that the regulators are giving them, pressuring them because they're trying to do things themselves that they maybe shouldn't be doing themselves. It might be a change in leadership at the institution. And the new CEO comes in and says, I don't know why you guys are doing this yourselves. We really ought to be outsourcing this. So it's some kind of driver normally that's external to Jack Henry. That prompts them to bring their business into an outsourced environment. And I don't think anything has changed in that regard in the past six months, or even in the past six years. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I now would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing comments. David Foss : Thank you, Keith.

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vance Sherard, Vice President, Investor relations. Please go ahead. Vance Sherard : Good morning and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry fiscal 2023 third quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today is David Foss, Board Chair and CEO; Mimi Carsley, CFO and Treasurer; and Greg Adelson, President and COO. After my opening remarks, I will turn the call over to Dave for his thoughts about the state of our business, financial and sales performance for the quarter, industry comments and other key initiatives. After Dave concludes his comments, Mimi will provide additional commentary regarding the financial results and fiscal year guidance included in the press release issued yesterday that is available from the investor relations section of the Jack Henry website. We will then open the lines for Q&A. As a reminder, this call includes certain Forward-Looking Statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends, or results like any statement about the future these are subject to multiple factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to multiple risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary, these risk factors and additional information please refer to yesterday\u2019s press release and the sections in our 10K entitled risk factors and forward-looking statements. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures are in yesterday\u2019s press release. I will now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Vance. Good morning, everyone. We are very pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue growth and an overall solid performance by our business. As always, I would like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our third fiscal quarter. For Q3 of fiscal 2023, total revenue increased 6% for the quarter and increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Consistent with our prior comments regarding the reduction in bank M&A this year, deconversion revenue was down approximately 65% as compared to the prior year quarter. Turning to the segments, we again had a good quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased 4% for the quarter and increased by 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payment segment performed very well, posting a 6% increase in revenue this quarter, and a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses with a 6% increase in revenue this quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis. As I highlighted in the press release, our sales professionals posted an extremely strong quarter led by the core sales team. On our last quarterly call, I mentioned that the sales team set an all time sales booking record in our fiscal Q2. Although we didn\u2019t break that record this quarter, we did set a record for the strongest Q3 in history. During the quarter, we inked 13 competitive core takeaways, so we continue at the approximately one deal per week run rate, I have discussed in the past. In addition to our success signing new core clients, we signed 13 existing on-prem core customers to move to our private cloud environment. In addition to the tremendous success we have experienced in our core business this quarter, we continue to attract new clients to our Digital Banking suite. During the third quarter, we signed 39 new clients to our Banno Retail platform with another 35 clients signed up for Banno business. Regarding our Banno Digital suite, as of March 31, we now have just over $9.3 million users live on the Banno platform. We continue to enjoy the highest consumer rating in the App Store and we are regularly recognized as the fastest application in the industry. The feedback from our 30 Banno business beta testing clients has been outstanding, and we remain on track to deliver Banno business into general availability later this quarter. Let me take a moment to address the banking landscape related to the liquidity challenges experienced by a couple of large regional banks in March and earlier this week. Although I\u2019m not aware of any Jack Henry core clients, who have tapped into the Federal Reserve\u2019s new Bank Term Funding program, I think the announcement has had a positive effect on the overall concern in the market regarding bank liquidity, and I applaud the Fed on their swift and decisive action. Since those events grab the headlines, members of our team have spoken with hundreds of our clients and I personally have visited with a large number of CEOs at our client banks. I\u2019m pleased to say that, our banking clients have indicated they have been largely unaffected by these events with the exception of several who have reported an influx of new accounts, as business clients look to diversify their deposit balances. Our clients typically have a diversified customer base, serve small and medium businesses and consumers in their local communities, and have longstanding and loyal customers, so I think it is logical that they wouldn\u2019t see an adverse impact as a result of a few extreme scenarios. Also remember that, a large part of our business is focused on the Credit Union industry with approximately half of all Credit Unions with more than one billion in assets partnered with Jack Henry as their primary technology provider. Those clients also report being largely unaffected by the challenges in the banking sector. In late April, [Interfy] (Ph) conducted a survey which generated responses from more than 550 bank CEOs, presidents and CFOs primarily at banks with less than $1 billion in assets. Approximately 77% of the respondents saw no significant inflows or outflows of deposits, 14% said they saw deposits decline by 2% or more and 9% said they saw an increase of at least 2% in deposits. I think these results are consistent with what we have heard anecdotally from our clients. We have seen no hesitation on the part of our clients to move ahead with technology to since the middle of March. And as I mentioned earlier, this was the largest third quarter in terms of sales bookings in the history of our company. What is more, our sales pipeline is now larger than at any other time, including a recognizable uptick in opportunities since our quarterly call in February. I\u2019m well aware of the challenges bankers face in today\u2019s economy and understand that things could change. But as we speak today, our clients are generally performing well and banks and Credit Unions are continuing to prioritize modernization of their technology stack to remain competitive and serve the evolving needs of their account holders. Hopefully, you have all seen the new corporate sustainability report that we published on March 31st. I think it is an excellent representation of the key initiatives and accomplishments we have been working on since we published our last report. In this new version, we provided a more detailed review of Jack Henry\u2019s demographic makeup, a summary of the results of our annual employee engagement survey, an overview of our data privacy and Cyber Security practices, and an outline of our commitment to setting science-based targets to the Science-Based Targets Initiative or SBTI to address the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the report highlights some of the public recognition we have received from organizations like Newsweek, Computer World and LinkedIn\u2019s top companies list. As we look toward the end of the fiscal year, our sales pipeline is much larger than it has ever been, and we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our customers, our ability to expand our customer relationships, and our long-term prospects for success. I look forward to seeing and chatting with many of you at our Investor Day in Denver in a couple of weeks. With that, I will turn it over to Mimi for some detail on the numbers. Mimi Carsley : Thanks, Dave. Good morning everyone. As Dave shared, Jack Henry had a successful third quarter, and I will call out the details driving those results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. For both the third quarter and first nine-months of our fiscal year, total revenue is up 6% on a GAAP basis and solidly up 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Now onto the third quarter details. On a GAAP basis, services and support revenue increased 3% in both the third quarter and year-to-date, consistent with trends over the past two quarters. Services and Support were negatively impacted as deconversion revenue decreased, 11 million for the quarter and 31 million year-to-date. This remains in-line with the limited broader market activity, acquisition activity in our space. With only a couple of months left, we are projecting approximately 20 million in deconversion revenue this fiscal year. However, forecasting deconversion activity is always challenging given the limited advanced notice and general uncertainty of M&A. Our private and public cloud offerings show robust growth this quarter, growing 11% and 10% year-to-date. Product delivery and services decreased 10% in the quarter, 11% year-to-date, impacted by lower deconversion revenue and convert merge activity offset by higher license and hardware revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, Services and Support revenue grew 8% for the quarter and 7% year-to-date, which serves to highlight the consistent strength of our business model. Processing revenue increased 11% on a GAAP basis for the quarter and 10% year-to-date. On a non-GAAP basis, the growth was 10% for the quarter and 9% year-to-date. The increases were driven by the higher card volumes and services, plus robust digital demand. Now, reviewing costs, cost of revenue is up 9% for the third quarter and 8% year-to-date. Quarterly drivers included increased card processing costs consistent with card revenue growth, higher personnel cost, and amortization expenses. These drivers are consistent across our year-to-date results. Research and development expense increased 13% during the quarter, mostly due to higher personnel costs and license fees furthering innovation. Year-to-date, these expenses increased 19% based on the same factors. SG&A rose 9% for the quarter, driven by increases in personnel related costs. Year-to-date, the increase was 8% driven by personnel, travel, professional services costs partly offset by the gain on sale of assets earlier this year. We remain focused on actions involving facility rationalization, head count and travel controls, procurement wins, and other expense management. Collectively, these efforts are helping offset inflationary pressures and driving positive operational results. Despite a decline in net income, primarily related to deconversion revenue and partially offset by a lower tax rate we delivered fully diluted earnings per share of $1.12 for the quarter. Thanks to our hardworking and dedicated associates, GAAP and non-GAAP results for the third quarter and nine-months of the year are consistent with internal expectations and set us up for a strong conclusion to FY 2023. As a reminder for transparency, the impact from the gain on sale of assets, the Payrailz acquisition and deconversion revenue are shown as part of the non-GAAP adjustments in the press release. Turning our attention to cash flow. Year-to-date, operating cash flow was 207 million down from 301 million in the same period last year due to lower deconversion revenue and the timing of taxes. The tax payments were significant outflow at 64 million in the quarter related to a change in the timing of the deductibility of development expenses. Free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx, and cash software plus proceeds from the sale of assets was 82 million year-to-date. Excluding the previously discussed tax payments and keeping year-to-date deconversion revenue flat, free cash flow would have been approximately 163 million. While balancing repurchase activities with maintaining a conservative balance sheet, we repurchased 151,000 shares during the quarter. We also returned capital to shareholders through a dividend of $0.52 per share, representing a 6% increase. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent, we are focused on maintaining ample liquidity, investing in our business to fuel growth, evaluating acquisitions, paying dividends and opportunistically repurchasing our stock. This consistent dedication to value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 20.1%. With that, let\u2019s review our outlook for the completion of our fiscal year. The press release included updated full-year GAAP guidance. The GAAP guidance remains inclusive of the Payrailz acquisition, gain on asset sales and deconversion revenue. We expect the year-to-date trends to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year impacting GAAP results. Most significantly assuming continued minimal consolidation in our customer base, deconversion revenue will remain muted. Considering year-to-date activity, we expect approximately 20 million of annual deconversion revenue representing a five million increase from our previous guidance provided on the last call. To be transparent, on our August full-year earnings call, we will outline our new approach to providing guidance for deconversion revenue. While the integration of Payrailz continues to meet expectations, there has been third-party implementation delays impacting FY 2023 revenue amounting to a shortfall of three million. This revenue remains in our pipeline, we remain confident in the strategic value and financial performance trajectory. We expect full-year GAAP revenue growth for fiscal 2023 to be between 5.5% to 5.9%. With respect to full-year GAAP EPS, we expect $4.85 to $4.87 per share with improvement driven from positive impacts from a modestly higher expected deconversion revenue, lower tax rate, partly offset by a slight increase in Payrailz dilution. Non-GAAP guidance remains unchanged due to the continued impressive and consistent performance of our business model. So in closing, we delivered another quarter of strong operational and financial results and remain solidly optimistic about the conclusion of this fiscal year. We thank all of our investors for their continued confidence in Jack Henry. Debbie will you please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Rayna Kumar with UBS. Please go ahead. Rayna Kumar : Good morning, David. In the past you have spoken about having the ability to sell Banno to non Jack Henry core customers. How is that progressing and in general, are you seeing the opportunity to sell your core processing services to larger financial institutions? David Foss : Yes. Good morning, Rayna. So two questions in there. First of as far as Banno is concerned. And I think I talked about this on the last earnings call. I know, I have talked about it in some of the fire side chats that I have done with some of you. We had in fact a plan to start selling Banno outside the base here in the fall of this past year. And what we learned much to our surprise was that, some of our competitors had identified that as an opportunity for them to hang on to their core customers. The that their core customer was going to be able to use Banno, they were essentially using that as a selling point for those customers to retain their legacy core system, because they would get the best of breed digital banking system without having to change out the cores, and that certainly was not part of our strategy. And so we kind of backed off on that, we were prepared in the fall to start selling outside the base. We backed away from that now, we are really reworking that strategy with a more targeted approach. And so you will hear more about that from us, I think later this year as far as how we are going to go to market with Banno outside the core base. As far as the - now you will have to remind me the second part of your question. We are selling up, sorry, selling up market. Good thing I have help here in the room. Selling up markets. So yes, first off, we are having great success with SilverLake in the banking side. And of course, we are the dominant player on the Credit Union side already a market. So approximately 50% of the Credit Union industry with assets over one billion are already Jack Henry core customers. So we are already the dominant player on the Credit Union side of the business. On the banking side, we have had great success here in the past few years moving up market particularly with our SilverLake core system. What has been interesting now was the tech modernization strategy, we are engaging with a number of customers now that are significantly larger than you would normally of as a Jack Henry core customer. We are very interested in what we are doing and are now seeing Jack Henry as the very probable technology partner that they want to partner up with going forward. So more to come on that, it is early days for us with some of these very large customers that we are talking to. But the prospects I think are pretty bright and much of that being driven by the tech modernization strategy that we have been talking about lately. Rayna Kumar : Very helpful. And then if I can fit one in for Mimi. Mimi, could you just comment on the debit processing volume in the quarter? And secondly, if you can just give us your preliminary thoughts on how FY 2024 revenue and operating margin could pan out given that close to your fiscal year end? Mimi Carsley : Thanks Rayna. Yes, so we continue to see the trends that have happened for the first nine-months of the year, and are consistent with the broader market data that you are getting from other industry players in terms of slightly slower as it relates to the consumer sentiment impacting those trends and a little bit more going to the credit side than the debit side. And as you know, we have a much bigger profile on debit in our business. So, our guidance incorporates the continuation of that trend. And then to your second question, unfortunately it is a little premature at this point to talk about FY 2024. Our teams are still heads down collaborating on the budgeting process, and we will probably share that more on the August call than we will today. David Foss : And can I add one comment on the debit trends? So I think there was a bit of a misunderstanding after the last call. We attributed a part of our guide change to the fact that the debit volumes we saw going forward, were going to slow just a little bit and certainly that is true. But that doesn\u2019t mean the debit business is underperforming. The debit side of our business has been a real solid performer for us this year. We just had little higher expectation for the remainder of the year then is reality, and that is why we made the adjustment. But the debit business is performing extremely well at Jack Henry. Operator : The next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Daniel Perlin : Thanks, good morning. Dave, I had a question, going back to the demand environment, I feel like there is this huge disconnect in the market with the stocks and kind of what we hear from the banks versus what you are seeing. I\u2019m just wondering if maybe we are getting it wrong a little bit. Like, is the pressure that the banks are feeling right now driving more tech demand to you as opposed to maybe the converse, which is I think what most people are expecting? David Foss : Yes, it is an insightful question, Dan, and I think what you are saying is generally correct. So if you are running a banker credit in the United States today, they have been performing pretty well and we all know the challenges that they are under and rate increases and cost of capital and that kind of stuff. But if you are running a banker credit in the United States today - for almost all of them, they need to continue to focus on modernizing their technology stack for one of two reasons. One, you are trying to attract new customers to your institution and customers aren\u2019t coming into the branch anymore, right. They are expecting to do things through some type of digital presentation layer. So for most banks and Credit Union that requires them to continue on this modernization track and make sure that they have the tools to attract not just consumers, but business customers small even the business customers are the lifeblood of our customers and how they operate on the banking side and so there is that driver. But then the other side of the equation is efficiency. For, so for most bankers, they can quote their efficiency ratio immediately to you without looking at any piece of paper. They can quote it off the top of their head because they are all focused on efficiency and trying to figure out where are those areas where we can drive efficiency through the operation. Well, generally technology is at the kind of the crux of where they are going to find efficiency. And so there too, Jack Henry is in the mix having those conversations with our customers. And then you throw into that, on top of that fraud and Cyber Security and all those kind of things, all of that stuff is driven by technology. And so, yes, I think there is a bit of a disconnect in this sense that because there is some turmoil in the industry, Jack Henry sales are going to be negatively impacted. They are just not, you know, the businesses continue to run and they need to continue to find technology solutions to help them with all those things that I just highlighted. Daniel Perlin : No, it sounds, somewhat counterintuitive, but it, I mean, it clearly makes sense in the current context. The quick question or follow-up on margins here, I know you don\u2019t want to go out to next year, but I would appreciate if you could maybe talk about some of the key, drivers and levers that you are going to be able to have here, whether it be expense control, specifically kind of mixed to the business, just as we start to think about, the margin expansion story again. Thank you. Mimi Carsley : Sure, Dan, great question. So, as we talked about previously, we continue to see margin expansion throughout the year. We knew it would be, you know, a modest amount this year, earlier in the year our original guidance was flat for the year. We are hopeful that we are on track for a small increase in margin expansion. I would say that things we are working on are consistent, we do a ton around efficiency, continuous improvement, we have done a lot on internal automization and procurement has been a huge win for us as we think about streamlining partnerships and really prioritizing that spend. So we are being really thoughtful on controllable spend, like travel, headcount additions, really thinking about each position from a zero base perspective. But there is nothing structurally that concerns me in terms of the ability to once again, continue back, now that we have the normalization of some of the headwinds we have seen past years and return out of COVID environment, that will return back to a margin expansion story. Daniel Perlin : That is great to hear. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Nik Cremo with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Nik Cremo : Hey, congrats on the strong results. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to get some more color on the performance and the payment segment in the quarter, just across the various business lines. And if you received any one-time benefits related to the banking turmoil, like some of your competitors. And just as my follow-up, are you still expecting Payrailz to be modestly accretive in FY 2024? Thank you. David Foss : So let\u2019s do Payrailz first, Greg is prepared to give you an overview of Payrailz and then we will talk about the rest of the payments business. Gregory Adelson : Yes, and I think, you know, so I will go ahead and start with Payrailz, but a couple things. So one, Mimi alluded to the fact that in her opening comments around, we do have some challenges with a couple of third-parties. And I think some of it is, headcount related and other constraints that they have to get some of the work done to allow some of our contracts that are already done and in the implementation queue to be brought into the production queue. So there is a few of those constraints and things that we are working through. But the good news is that since September when we made that acquisition, we have actually sold 48 new contracts and 17 add-ons, add-ons or things like the P2P solution. We have a loan payment solution, things like that. So the sales engine is starting to move, and a lot of the sales that were done previously before we acquired Payrailz were really predominantly done through that third-party channel. So of course we have a much larger sales force and folks that are focused on selling more direct deals. So we are pretty - very optimistic on what is happening in the sales side of this. We just need a couple of the integration partners to be able to get some of their work done that will help us to accelerate the revenue in fiscal year 2024. And I can start on the payment side too. So I think and Mimi alluded to what was going on, on our card business, which continues to go very, very strongly as far as growth. But when you look at the rest of our payment businesses, there is a nice mix of growth, maybe not to the same level that we had, remote deposit capture in our EPS business was significant during the pandemic. Obviously folks were not going into branches at all, though that continues for the most part. That business is not growing at the same pace it did, but still in a double-digit growth in our portfolio. So things that we are doing in our pay center business around general payments and preparation for FedNow, which we can talk about at some point too. But in our clearinghouse business and what we have done with Zelle, we continue to have about 60% of all the clearinghouse customers that are out. There is only about 300 clearinghouse and we have over 180 that are live on Jack Henry today. That continues to grow nicely and so that is business continues to have a lot of upside. Mimi Carsley : Yes. I would just add that there is consistency to Greg\u2019s point, there is consistency across remit cards, payments, also led by things like the fraud and other risk management solutions that are add on. So I would say that from a consistency of growth will continue and then added by the benefit of Payrailz. Operator : And the next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. You have called out your new sales pipeline at a record level. Could you walk through what are the biggest drivers of that, is that new tech modernization modules, is it Banno business, SilverLake what are the underlying components of that strength? David Foss : Sure, Dave. And one thing I will highlight as I go through this, when I talk about pipeline, I know there has been some confusion in the past. I\u2019m not talking about individual deals, how many core customers are in the pipeline or anything like that. I\u2019m talking the dollar amount essentially. And this is a non-GAAP number, but it is the dollar amount that we track as far as the value of each contract. So in theory that all converts into revenue at some point after deals are signed and they are implemented as far as the drivers. So core continues to be king for us, when it comes to a driver. We have just a tremendous amount of core activity right now, both banking and Credit Union as far as customers that are talking to Jack Henry about trading out their existing technology. Some of that is certainly driven by tech modernization, but I don\u2019t think it is as much driven by, I want to sign for the tech modernization module right now today. It is more about Jack Henry has a strategy that makes sense to us as bank and Credit Union executives, their strategy makes sense. We need to look them now and get to Jack Henry now, because we want to be partnered with them as they continue to evolve. And so there is a lot of that, that is driving interest in our existing core customers. So SilverLake primarily on the banking side and of course - on the Credit Union side. But then on top of that, Banno continues to be a driver and that is why I call it out on these calls almost every time. There is a tremendous amount of interest in Banno. Our new Financial Crimes Defender solution that we have talked about on this call, that rolling out here very soon. We have a lot of customers that are looking at Financial Crimes Defender because it is the first brand new ground up, public cloud native broad solution in the industry in many years and so lots of interest not only inside our core base but outside the core base in that solution. Our Treasury Management Solution is getting great reviews today. So continued interest in Treasury Management. Certainly, Cards we have talked about, the number of customers that we have been adding to the Cards business, so continuing to drive interest there. Our Online Commercial Lending solution, tremendous amount of interest in that. So it is just a broad variety of solutions that I think the common thread in all of that is almost all of those non-core solutions have been written and rolled out within the past two, three, four-years. So it is a new technology that people are interested in. And then of course, on the core side, all about our tech modernization initiative there. And so you put all those things together, much of what is driving this is the recognition in the industry that Jack Henry has put a tremendous amount of investment into brand new technology and new solutions to help our customers solve problems and so that is what is getting us a lot of attention. Gregory Adelson : This is Greg. I would like to add a relevant example. So we actually just got an inbound request from a large regional that hadn\u2019t talked to us since 2010, and they came to us and said, Hey, we would like to renew conversations based on what we have heard about you in the industry the tech modernization story and things in general. And that is a relevant example, because these are larger institutions that we typically wouldn\u2019t have seen in the past, but again that are inbound to us because of the things that we are doing and with stuff that Dave just described. David Togut : What is the asset size of that large regional bank Greg? Gregory Adelson : It is greater than 50 billion. David Foss : And we are engaged today, Dave, with a number in the mid 20 billion space. Several banks in the mid twenties are talking to us today. And I think a lot of it is because of what they have seen with tech modernization and, but they are not talking about moving right to that platform. They are talking about SilverLake and then evolving to that platform. David Togut : Understood. And just as the follow-up, what is your latest view on timing of rollout of FedNow Jack Henry\u2019s role and how material could FedNow be to Jack Henry over the next 12 plus months? Gregory Adelson : Yes, this is Greg. I will take that question as well. So, good insightful question. We are absolutely ready. We are already fully certified and on July 19th, when the first transaction takes place, we will be part of that transaction process. We have 20 institutions that will be going live between the July 19th timeframe and sometime in late August based on just rollout with those institutions. We can go as fast as they want to go. We have 51 contracts that are already sold and a significant number of others that are in process just based on interest. I think to your point about significance of where this is in our portfolio, time will tell. A lot of it is going to be based on use cases and there is a lot of rumors that the Fed in general will be mandating for several use cases that will be important for institutions to be set up on the now at least aspect of the equation, allowing them to receive payments if one comes to them. So we are having very detailed conversations with a lot of our institutions about the importance of at least being set up on the receive aspect even if they are not ready to go to the send aspect. But again, we are very bullish on this, the clearing house there had been some challenges just because some institutions that we work with were a little leery of working with the larger conglomerate that owns the clearing house versus the Fed being a part of this. So, we think we are going to see a little more uptick in the FedNow solution than maybe that we saw so far in the clearinghouse one. David Foss : Pleased to emphasize Dave, the level of our involvement with the Fed on this project, I was just in Washington DC on Monday, so two days ago, meeting with some of the Fed presidents and the FedNow team and our, the president of our payments division was with me talking strategy, talking rollout. This was a Jack Henry only meeting with these Fed presidents. So we are very engaged with the Fed and very - it is top of mind for us to make sure that we are helping our customers take advantage of this opportunity. David Togut : Understood. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Vasu Govil with KBW. Please go ahead. Vasundhara Govil : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first one, I know you will share more on your Investor Day, but just thinking about revenue growth next year through what are some of the puts and takes that we should consider? Mimi Carsley : Hi Vasu, while I appreciate the question. You know, we are still in the midst of planning. In fact, this afternoon we will be spending the whole afternoon with the sales team on their planning for next year. You know, I would say overall, as Dave mentioned, a continuation of both the transition and implementation from a great pipeline from the last two-years, plus, the continued interest in some of these new products. Banno business wasn\u2019t in the year numbers for FY 2023 will be in 2024, so that is a nice bump as well. But I would say it is going to be a continuation of a diverse portfolio growing very well. Vasundhara Govil : That is helpful. And then just to follow-up on the complementary segment, clearly Banno is a big driver there. Maybe David, you could talk about what are the, some of the other products that rise to the top in terms of growth drivers, and then as we think about growth in that segment, long-term, is mid-single digit store the right base going forward, or do you see that accelerating? David Foss : I\u2019m sorry, I missed the last part of your question, is what? Oh, mid-single digits. Okay. Sorry. Yes. So, as you know, Vasu, the complementary segment is a little bit of a challenging one to talk about because there are so many solutions in there, but I understand your point, trying to figure out what are the key drivers. So there are several, I already highlighted the financial crimes defender solution that we are just now rolling out. So we definitely expect that to be a key driver for us in the coming year. Banno is in that segment, and so Banno will of course, continue to be a driver as we are rolling out Banno Business, treasury management that I called out a little while ago. Treasury is in that segment that will continue to be a, a driver for us. Most of the fraud solutions that are not specific to payments, so the payments fraud pieces show up in the payment segment, but the other fraud type things that, security solutions, for example, those are all in that segment that is always top of mind for our customers. So that continues to be a driver for us as well. So it is just a lot of different things. And then, as I mentioned earlier, our online commercial lending solution, that has really picked up here in the past several months. We have had that solution in market for probably four years now, but in the past few months, it is really picked up as far as the level of engagement with customers and prospects. And so a bunch of different pieces. And so to the second part of your question about, you know, mid single digits, I think that is a good assumption because with so many solutions in there, you have some that are growing quickly and some that are kind of, you know, just steady performers. And so I think that is a good assumption for that segment for the long-term. Vasundhara Govil : Great. And just on that online commercial lending solution, sort of any drivers by, you think that is gaining more traction now? David Foss : Yes, well, I think it is because it is an interesting thing when you work with banks, you know, in banks, most bank CEOs grew up in the bank as a commercial lender, that is their background for most of them. Commercial lenders, they are the money makers in the bank, right. But you can talk all day long about consumers and what wonderful relationships you have with your consumers. But what really makes money for a bank is the commercial lending business. And so that is small, medium business customers and then of course even larger customers. Commercial lenders tend to have a process that they follow. They are the money makers. They are the people who have a process that they follow. They have tended traditionally to be averse to using more technology. But now with so many people, particularly on the backside of the pandemic, so many people not wanting to go to the branch, they have gotten used to this idea of being able to do everything through some kind of a digital layer. Commercial lenders are getting a lot more comfortable with the idea and I don\u2019t say they like it, but they are accepting it. They are getting more comfortable with the idea that their customers, small medium businesses expect to be able to apply for a loan and interact with the bank using a commercial presentation layer that is exactly what our solution does. It is a complete commercial lending solution that is hosted online, where the borrower can do everything they need to do through that presentation and then the lender can interact with them again through that technology. So I think it is a result of the backside of the pandemic. Customer expectation has changed, and lenders are kind of oftentimes grudgingly accepting the fact that, their customers want to do things differently and they are now thinking about how do we adopt different technology to make sure we take care of our customers. Vasundhara Govil : Great. Thank you very much. David Foss : Certainly. Operator : The next question is from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Peter Heckmann : Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but I wanted to follow-up on FedNow. I guess is it your impression that with FedNow, the primary use case is going to be enterprise B2B and likely replacing same day ACH. And related to that, are you aware of any other use cases that, might involve the consumer or other sort of niche processes that you think are going to be stronger and out of the gates? Gregory Adelson : Yes, Pete. Actually, I think that could be one example. I think what we have seen even with some of the other solutions that are out there that we think will be the primary use case is with the gig workers. The gig workers taking the payments that they are getting and moving them using and remember the FedNow solution actually is truly real time. The Clearing House solution still has kind of a batch settlement on the back end. And so the ability though they have access to their funds immediately, the process is different. But using the gig workers to move those funds into their FI accounts, we see that today with a lot of the stuff that we have with the Clearing House and the Fed believes that to be a big one. The other one is having the FI customers, the financial institution customers actually moving money from external wallets into the depository accounts as well. So there is a whole host of use cases that are being built out of those two scenarios, as well as and Dave was just there, there is going to be some - I don\u2019t know if I would call them mandates, but there is going to be some strong requests for things to be done through the FedNow account for stuff like various tax payments. David Foss : And one of the things we talked about Monday was VA benefits. Gregory Adelson : Yes. So there is going to insurance payments, things like that. Things that the Treasury and the Fed can control, they are going to be pushing that. So that is why it is important for processors like Jack Henry, who can really kind of help to get to that last mile of institutions to get that received now turned on. So regardless of where that payment is being initiated from it has a place to land. Peter Heckmann : Okay that is helpful. And then just to clarify though, again, with that now, it doesn\u2019t sound as if there is a lot of applications that are currently either cash based or card based that will be replaced with real time payments. It is primarily some form of ACH or interbank transfer. Is that how you see it? Gregory Adelson : No, I do see some reasonableness to some of the card products. There is various things that happen today in the B2B world that where transactions that typically would have gone out paper, maybe would have gone out through a virtual card program or things like that where there is interchange and some of those programs could be disintermediated because of this type of solution. So I think there is going to be some heavy focus on B2B solutions as well, because there is so much paper in the process today. And other types of card payments maybe at a merchant level where depending on how the merchant is set up could those transactions to them or from them end up going through that channel as well. So yet to be determined, but I think the card part of this specifically on merchant side and specifically in B2B payments could have some chances for disintermediation. Peter Heckmann : Okay, good that is helpful. Thanks. Gregory Adelson : Sure. Operator : The next question is from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Kartik Mehta : Hey Dave, I know you and I have talked about this a little bit, but one of the things I think that gets misunderstood is how strong your pipeline is and how much a visibility you have on revenue and I\u2019m wondering if you could just talk about you have talked about how the pipeline has grown, just looking at the pipeline and what kind of visibility you have and what kind of confidence that gives you over the next 12-months to 18-months. David Foss : Yes thanks Kartik. So, it is an interesting thing in this the business that we are in with the recurring revenue model that we have built. So first off, when it comes to the contracts that we already have signed, we of course have a tremendous amount of visibility because we are almost 90% recurring revenue as far as the contracts that we have in-house and the kind of watching the revenue build on those contracts. And then that once we sign a customer, oftentimes, depending on the product, it can take one-month to 12-months depending on what they purchase from us for that revenue to start layering in so we see the visibility into that. And then, as far as the pipeline is concerned, so when you have been doing this as long as I have and I have been doing this a long time, we have a very predictable model. So, I\u2019m not going to quote numbers here, but I can tell you with a pretty high degree of accuracy, if the pipeline is X, then Y percentage of the pipeline is very likely to close, because we have years and years and years of history doing this. And so we know that that is going to translate into Z dollars of revenue overtime and so we can kind of do that math and predict pretty accurately what the impact is going to be. Now, the challenge again, is some of those solutions. You sign a contract today and we won\u2019t see you the first dime practically of revenue for nine-months to 12-months. Some of them, you sign a contract today and you have revenue flowing in and in one-month. And so, there is some art to this, but there is a lot of science to it as well. Just based on all the experience that we have doing this for as long as we have and understanding the way these contracts works and the way customers make decisions. Gregory Adelson : Well, sometime you will have to give us X, Y, and Z. Dave. Kartik Mehta : And then just thinking about, I don\u2019t want to call it a banking crisis, just the issues that are out there and looking at Jack Henry when the last crisis happened and kind of how you looked at the business then and what happened, and if there is any lessons you could take from that and what is happening today. I know they are very different, but just trying to get a feel for maybe, you know, what we could clean. David Foss : Yes, it is a very different environment today from 2007, 2008 for sure. And of course, if you go back in time and look at Jack Henry\u2019s performance during the period of the Great Recession, we performed really well, even though there were hundreds of banks that were being shutdown at that time and of course, many of them were our customers that were being shutdown. So I think the major difference, if you look specifically at Jack Henry between then and now is at that time we were still very dependent on license fees and maintenance revenue. So when customers kind of pulled their arms in and said, we are not spending on anything, you know, our revenue had the potential to drop significantly because we were so dependent on license fees. And when, whenever you sell a license, you see the impact in the quarter as opposed to being spread like we do today. Today a course, so back then we were, you know, maybe, maybe 50%, 60%hosted, today we are, you know, recurring revenue. Today we are 90% recurring revenue. So very different from a Jack Henry\u2019s perspective as far as the predictability of revenue because of a bank is challenged unless they shutdown, they don\u2019t quit spending money with us, you know, they don\u2019t decide all of a sudden we are just going to quit processing loans you have to still process loans, which means you still have to pay Jack Henry for that service. And so today I would draw a significant contrast as far as our business and the resilience of our business as bankers are going through what they are going through right now that does not say we are bulletproof. It doesn\u2019t say we are totally immune to any challenges out there, but I think we have a much more resilient model than we had during the Great Recession at that time. And again, if you go back and look at how we performed during that period, we performed pretty well. And so my expectation is that we should be able to weather this storm right now. And of course, much of this storm is the result I mean, these are runs on the banks that are happening, right. So you get some headline somewhere that says this bank is, has a liquidity challenge. And by the way, liquidity and capitalization, those have been conflated over and over in these conversations two totally different topics. And yet this, run on the banks are happening because, wildfire - the spreads like wildfire through social media that there is some challenge at a bank. Everybody uses their digital banking solution to withdraw money from the bank and all of a sudden they are in trouble. And so I just view this as two totally different scenarios, but if I look specifically at our company, we are in a much better position to weather the storm than we were even in 2008 and we performed very really well in 2008. Kartik Mehta : Perfect. Thanks Dave. I really appreciate it. David Foss : Certainly. Operator : The next question is from John Davis with Raymond James. Please go ahead. John Davis : Hey, good morning. Mimi, just wanted to follow-up on Dan\u2019s question around margins. I think the guide implies about a 250 basis point year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter. So anything to call out from a timing perspective or what kind of gives you confidence in that ramp in 4Q margins? Mimi Carsley : Yes, thanks JD. Great question. Yes, I think that 250 is a good estimation. I think we feel good about that. We always knew that it would be a grow as the year continued kind of situation and we are seeing that transpire. So I feel good with that estimation. John Davis : Okay. And then, you called out tax payment timing, for the free cash flow in the quarter. So how should we think about free cash flow conversion for the full-year obviously 4Q is always a huge free cash flow conversion quarter. So just curious, I think you did guys in like mid eighties conversions last year, just any sort of guide rails for us for the full-year. Mimi Carsley : Yes, great question. And JD, I love that you are looking at it on an annual basis versus a quarterly just because of the lumpiness that any one quarter can have, in this quarter in particular between the deconversion and then the larger tax payments and just kind of going into that. We were waiting for some legislative clarity around IRC-174 like a lot of companies that impacted the capitalization, the deductibility of that capitalized labor. Unfortunately, with lack of legislative clarity, we had to make a payment. So you wouldn\u2019t normally have seen that kind of maybe spread over a couple of quarters that is a timing thing. It doesn\u2019t impact our tax rate that will reverse over several years and kind of normalize. So I think that, obviously will not be a part of Q4. As you said, we have a large inflow. So you will certainly see an uptick. I think the reality is because of deconversion revenue, we also have a couple of larger renewals of some third-party expenses in third quarter. I think it will be light of our target of the 100% free cash flow conversion that we target, but I think it will step definitely be an uptick from third quarter. John Davis : Okay. And then last one for me. Dave, you talked about some of the impact from all the banking turmoil has been kind of increased in account growth. So maybe how should we think about your business, like what percentage of revenue ballpark is priced on kind of a per account basis versus transaction or anything else? Just to kind of help us understand what the account growth can mean from a revenue perspective. David Foss : Really, I don\u2019t know that I know the answer to that question. Anybody want to guess. I mean, the payment businesses, but he is talking about account base. So it is the core business essentially. Gregory Adelson : 25%. David Foss : 25% okay. We will go with 25% JD. John Davis : Okay, alright. Thanks guys. David Foss : Sure. Operator : The next question is from David Koning with Baird. Please go ahead. David Koning : Thanks. And Maybe I guess first of all just on Q4 kind of the implied guide is for somewhere around 6% I think kind of non-GAAP revenue growth, which the rest of the course of the year I think we are kind of 6% to 8.5%. So it is a little slower. What is the reason for the slower in Q4? Mimi Carsley : Hi, Dave. Good morning. I would say if anything, I think there is a little bit of conservatism in that, I would expect us to maybe be a slightly biased toward the higher side of that range. I think with a little bit of uncertainty still in the consumer sentiment, we just wanted to think about a little bit conservative, but trends, I feel are still quite strong for the year and in terms of getting us to our full-year number or better. David Koning : Okay. And then I guess on Payrailz, I think year-to-date, you add back the loss from acquisitions to non-GAAP margin, I believe. And I think it is trended like around $10 million year-to-date loss, so probably a little more by the end of the year. Is that all going away in 2024? And basically is that why you can get to accretion in 2024 like, is that just the main what just kind of goes away? Mimi Carsley : So it will not be part of non-GAAP in 2024 for sure. So that will be one component. But I also think, it is just a question of having let some of those inflationary pressures like the great resignation, wage inflation, we saw some of the third-party one-time costs like - are now in our normalized base rate. David Foss : But he was specifically talking about Payrailz. Mimi Carsley : He was talking about the impact on margin. So I think we are still set for margin expansion in 2024 because of the base now running through the 2023 numbers where it wasn\u2019t in the 2022 numbers. So I think we are still in good shape as well as some of the efficiency measures that we are continuing to focus on internally. David Koning : Got you. Thank you and I appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette : Hey good morning everybody, thanks a lot for the time. I think most of the questions around demand and sales cycle, et cetera, you guys have at least addressed a little bit. I wanted to ask, quickly on capital allocation, I think, Dan raised a kind accountability change in sentiment in the market, and clearly, that is impacted your stock at the same time continue to wonder about M&A. So just any comments how you are thinking about capital allocation and what looks attractive to you right now and how you would prioritize? David Foss : Yes, so nothing has changed there. James, as far as capital allocation is concerned we are committed to our dividend policy and Mimi emphasized that in her comments. As we have said many times before, M&A is always at the top of our list. We do share buybacks when it makes sense for us and Mimi highlighted that of course in her comments as well. But M&A, I have said it many times, we are a solid acquirer. We know how to do integration well of companies once we acquire them. We are very disciplined and only pursuing acquisitions that we think are really going to be additive to our business in the long-term. I think Payrailz is a great example of that. You have seen that it is a little challenged in the short-term, but when we look at what we are doing with that business in the long-term, I think it is going - I\u2019m absolutely convinced it is going to be a real home run for Jack Henry in the long-term. And that is the way we think about doing M&A. We are always looking for those things that we believe we can take advantage of as a long-term solution for our customers to help our customers perform better. Now, I was hoping and I have said this in many forums that by this time and even several months ago, that there would have been a lot more interesting M&A opportunity for Jack Henry. We have been looking at some companies, we continue to look at some at companies to acquire. But there just hasn\u2019t been anything that has kind of jumped over that bar for us so far here, even though the deal flow hasn\u2019t been particularly strong. We have been looking at some deals, but nothing has jumped over the bar here recently, but we are going to continue to look. Mimi Carsley : Let James, just to add one more thing, which is consistent with our priorities, is paying down the debt through our normal cash flow from operations. And so, you would expect to see that over the next several months, years that we are going to continue to decline the debt balance. James Faucette : Thanks for that Mimi and then Dave, we have spent a lot of headlines around technology layoffs and headcount reductions, et cetera. How is that impacting your ability to go out and hire and add talent to the Jack Henry pool and maybe that even out of your customer, anything you can talk about there? David Foss : Yes, it has been an interesting time since the great resignation. We went from the great resignation where everybody was resigning their jobs and going to find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow to within about three-months, all of a sudden companies were doing these massive layoffs. And so, a lot of heads were spinning, I think, among employees and a lot of these companies. So for us here in the recent past, we have picked up some really good new hires and we have had some wonderful, what we refer to here as boomerangs. People who left because they wanted to chase the pot of gold, and then they realized the pot of gold wasn\u2019t there. And they called us up and said, can we come back? And those are great additions to us because they already know our company, they know how we do things and they are often times really talented folks. So we have had a number of boomerangs come back. We are attracting some great talent from some other companies in our space that have been challenged, and so they understand the industry, they understand what we do, may not understand the Jack Henry products completely, but we found some really good talent people that were a little shaken by what is happening at other companies in the industry who are looking for a steady provider. And so they have joined Jack Henry. So we are not just hiring left and right, we are being very judicious about when we hire and where we hire and so we are trying to be very selective about who we choose to join the Jack Henry team. But I think the overall message would be we have had some great additions to our team in the last two, three, four-months. James Faucette : That is very great color there, Dave. David Foss : Sure. Operator : The next question is from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Dominick Gabriele : Hey, great. Good morning, everybody. David, I don\u2019t know the best way to ask this, so I\u2019m just going to go ahead and ask, I guess you are the sole survivor of the big four companies in core platform as far as CEOs go from pre-pandemic, a lot of our clients actually do ask about what is the long-term succession plan, if there even should be one, you have had a major contribution to this enterprise. And so I do get questions about if a succession plan ever came, would it be someone inside, outside? How do we think about that not thinking about timing, but what does a succession plan look like in the past for Jack Henry in general for CEO and I\u2019m not saying you should leave. David Foss : That is the most polite way that anybody has ever described me as old. No, you are old Dave. So what is the plan? No. So Dom, it is a reasonable question now, you know, obviously I can\u2019t share specifics about either my timing or succession planning at Jack Henry. But I will tell you, and then of course, I\u2019m also Board Chair at Jack Henry and so this is a real focus for us is making sure that we have a solid succession plan in place. As a matter of fact, so next week is our quarterly board meeting, and may the Board meeting in May is when I always review with the governance committee my personal succession plan. I also review with the entire Board the succession plans for the entire leadership team. So I will have all the members of the leadership team with their successors or what the plan is. So if it is an internal candidate, I will highlight that for the Board. If it is a plan to do a search, then we, I will highlight that as well. And so all of those options are on the table. What I normally do is I walk into the governance committee meeting with some suggestions of internal candidates and also external candidates. I know a lot of people in the industry and I know people who might be a decent fit for a role like this and so I try to give the Board a good kind of overview of who potential candidates might be. And then ultimately, of course, it is the Board\u2019s decision to hire or fire the CEO and, so - but we have a very rigorous exercise that we go through around the topic of succession, not just for me, but for all members of the leadership team at Jack Henry. Dominick Gabriele : Excellent. Thanks so much, on that one. And Mimi, you have mentioned in the prepared remarks a few times about personnel related costs increasing year-over-year. And this was kind of talked about in last question, but not exactly. Is there a way to kind of break up new hires versus wage inflation versus tech talent demand in those growth rates or just to kind of parse out largest factor, least important factor as we think about the go forward growth and expenses for personnel? Thanks so much. Mimi Carsley : Yes. Good question. I would say the headcount on account basis has been modest, we are about 3% increase in headcount from a number of positions year-on-year, which is a much lower percentage than obviously the fully baked cost of that. As Dave mentioned, we are being very judicious on where those heads go, we have been focusing on customer facing roles, like service roles as well as R&D roles and then we look at every role on a zero based budgeting perspective when we are thinking about that. I can\u2019t really give you a lot of breakout in terms of - because we just don\u2019t provide that level of detail in terms of vacancies versus new rollovers, but I would just say we are being really judicious about it. Dominick Gabriele : Great. Thanks. Operator : The final question is from Mark Feldman with William Blair. Please go ahead. Mark Feldman : Hi guys. This is Mark on for Chris. Thanks for taking the question here. So just wanted to ask on Banno, do you guys have any information regarding the asset size of the institutions that you are seeing the primary uptake from Banno and any interest in it? And I guess additionally adding on to that, what does Banno for business do for your sale forces ability to close Banno signings that they didn\u2019t have before without the offering? David Foss : Yes. So we have about 700-ish clients that are live today on Banno and they are all over the board as far as asset size. I would say that the primary adopters have been a little bit on the larger side. So let\u2019s say averaging closer to $1 billion probably as opposed to something smaller than that. So that has been the primary adoption, but we continue to see great demand across asset sizes. And as I highlighted earlier, most banks in crediting is need to modernize their technology presentation to consumers through or - and business customers through a digital presentation. As far as Banno business, so if you think about traditional Banno, it is designed for the retail consumers. So you or me and all the functionality is retail in nature, Banno business provides that a similar functionality but for business customers so specifically things like cash management. And the ability within the application for the, let\u2019s say, the CFO of the small, medium business and the CEO to communicate about financial transactions within the application. So it is a really interesting and robust application designed specifically to help a business manage their business and communicate about financial transactions and decisions within the business, but in the financial applications. So it is a revolutionary new solution and we have a lot of anchors that are very excited about the rollout of this platform. Mark Feldman : Great, thanks. And if I can ask you just one more on with credit cards. I know in the past you originally didn\u2019t have the sales force that could go out and infrastructure to go and sell the product. Do you have any update on where that is today and when we can start seeing some deals getting signed with credit cards? Thank you. Gregory Adelson : Hey Mark, this is Greg. I can take that one. So yes, we have a dedicated sales force, we also have dedicated install and operational folks that now all have the experience so that is starting to ramp up. We also added if you saw press release we did a couple of months ago on an agent program that we have added, we now have a lot of interest in that agent program and that is typically for smaller institutions that they themselves don\u2019t have the folks or the infrastructure to really support that type of full service credit solution. So that is giving us another angle to sell the credit side of our business. We already have, I think, two or three now in the pilot phase of that and we have a pipeline of about 10 or more just in the last two to three-months. So that is starting to grow, but that all of those products will continue to accelerate overtime. Mark Feldman : Good. Thank you. Gregory Adelson : Sure. Operator : This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. David Foss : Thank you, Debbie. We have additional upcoming investor engagement opportunities with management at multiple investor events. The first one is going to be our Annual Investor Day, which will be held in Denver on the afternoon of Monday, May 15th at 1 :00 PM Mountain Time. The agenda includes presentations from wide selection of the Jack Henry management team and reception that will include demos of some of our newest solutions. We look forward to hosting those attending in person and via the webcast. We are pleased with the quarterly results and thank all Jack Henry Associates for their efforts in producing these results. Thank you for joining us today and Debbie, would you please provide the replay number? Operator : Yes. The replay number for today\u2019s call is (877) 344-7529 and the access code is 1452467. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Vance Sherard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Vance Sherard : Thank you, Anthony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me today on the call is David Foss, Board Chair and CEO; Mimi Carsley, CFO and Treasurer; and Greg Adelson, President and COO. After my opening remarks, I will turn the call over to Dave for his thoughts about the state of our business, financial and sales performance for the quarter, industry comments, and other key initiatives. After Dave concludes his comments, Mimi will provide additional commentary regarding the fiscal - the financial results and fiscal year guidance included in the press release issued yesterday that is available from the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website. We will then open the lines for Q&A. As a reminder, this call includes certain forward-looking statements including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends, or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to multiple factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to multiple risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures are in yesterday's press release. I will now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Vance. Good morning, everyone. Today, we're very pleased to share details with you for a quarter that produced record revenue and record sales bookings. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for our fourth quarter and for the entire fiscal year. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, total revenue increased 11% for the quarter and increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were up as compared to the prior-year quarter but were still down significantly for the full fiscal year. Turning to the segments, we had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 11% for the quarter and increased by 10% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payment segment performed well posting a 9% increase in revenue this quarter and a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a very robust quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with an 11% increase in revenue this quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis. As I highlighted in our press release, the fourth quarter was the strongest quarter for sales bookings in the history of the company. With those of you who follow us - those of you who follow us closely, you will know that in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '22, we set an all-time sales record. We broke that record in the second quarter of fiscal '23, and now we've set another new record in the fourth quarter of '23. Additionally, we set a new annual sales record in fiscal year '23. All-in-all this has been a remarkable year for the sales teams. To provide a little detail regarding sales successes in the quarter, we booked 16 competitive core takeaways and an additional 19 deals to move existing on-prem core clients to our private cloud environment. Several of our complementary offerings also saw very strong demand in the quarter with, as you might guess, our digital suite leading the pack. We signed 63 new clients to our Banno Digital platform in the quarter and 19 new clients to our card processing solution. For the full year, we signed 47 competitive core takeaways with five of those institutions with greater than $1 billion in assets. Additionally, we signed 52 contracts to move on-premise core clients to our private cloud, 56 new clients for our card processing solution, and 198 new Banno Digital customers. Of course, we signed a variety of other contracts for many of our other solutions as well. But it's important to note that almost all of these contracts represent long-term recurring revenue came on to Jack Henry, for a wide variety of our solutions. Regarding the Banno Digital suite, we were at almost 10 million registered users at the end of the fiscal year. As a point of reference, on July first of 2020, we had about 3.2 million registered users. So in three years, we've seen our user count triple in size. This is significant because as I've stressed in the past, most of the revenue for a business like this is tied to the number of users on the platform. We delivered Banno business into general availability for our bank clients in late July, and the response has been outstanding. More than 25 banks are live and we signed an additional 53 Banno business clients in fiscal Q4. On July 20, we became one of the first service providers to support live transactions on the Federal Reserves' new FedNow instant payment service. More than 100 of our clients are in various stages of implementation and we expect to add 100s of financial institutions over the next 12 months. We plan to deliver Financial Crimes Defender, our real-time fraud and anti-money laundering compliance platform into general availability for our banking clients in late September and for our Credit Union clients late this calendar year. As you may recall, it's been one year since we announced our corporate rebranding to retire the Symitar, ProfitStars, and Jack Henry Banking brands and go to market is simply Jack Henry. I said on this call a year ago that uniting the brands reflects Jack Henry's role as a well-rounded financial technology provider and enables us to speak from a single consistent brand voice. We've seen strong results during the year from our rebranding, including a 50% increase in website visits and a 30% increase in social media followers. I also mentioned on our last call that we recently published our 2023 sustainability report. I'm pleased to share that Jack Henry has been recognized as a 2023 Climate Leader by USA TODAY and Statista for our ongoing efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, we were recently recognized as one of America's Greatest Workplaces by Newsweek. Our consistent placement in Best Places to Work ranking is a testament to the workplace culture we have at Jack Henry and our employee engagement scores reflect that strong culture. Our continuous listening program enables us to gather feedback from our associates throughout the year and I'm pleased to share that overall our participation rate this year was greater than 65%. We achieved an engagement capital score of 81% and 87% of our employees said that they believe in Jack Henry's values, all well-above industry benchmarks. By taking care of our associates, they, in turn, are taking care of our clients, delivering outstanding customer service is a hallmark of our company and this past year was no exception. On surveys we send to customers, we scored an average of 4.6 out of 5 for overall customer satisfaction and 4.75 out of 5 for satisfaction with our customer service representatives, both are increases over our already industry-leading satisfaction scores. We are encouraged by recent surveys of financial institutions showing positive growth and sentiment around technology spending for the balance of the calendar year. To that end, Bank Directors 2023 technology survey will be published in September and it will provide a helpful barometer of Bank sentiment relative to technology. I will plan to share these results with you on our November call. In today's environment, we found that no matter what financial institution is trying to solve for, technology is almost always the solution. Our breadth of solutions regularly positions us well to participate in these opportunities. In Mimi's comments, she will discuss the program we recently offered to a select group of associates who meet certain criteria. Internally we refer to this offering as our Voluntary Early Departure Incentive Program. We have many employees who have been with us for a long-time and this program enables us to reward them while giving others a chance to move up in the organization. While there is a cost associated with this program, it is something we've offered in the past that has been well-received and produced positive long-term results for the company. As I reflect back on fiscal 2023, I can confidently say it was a very good year for our company. Our employee engagement scores remained high and our levels of customer engagement and customer satisfaction scores are also very high. Mimi has been in her role - in CFO role for nearly a year and her collaborative thoughtful leadership has had a visible impact on both you as investors and our associates. Our sales teams are performing extremely well and have positioned us for continued success with the sales pipeline that is the largest we've ever had entering a new fiscal year. We believe that our commitment to doing the right thing for our constituents will continue to serve us well. We will continue with our disciplined approach to running the company, and expect that approach to help provide stability for our employees, customers, and shareholders. As we begin the new fiscal year, I continue to be very optimistic about our future. With that, I will turn it over to Mimi for some detail on the numbers. Mimi Carsley : Thank you, Dave, and hello, everyone. As always, we remain focused on serving our community and regional financial institution clients, growing our business, investing in our future, and delivering stockholder value. This focus led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. This morning, I'll begin with the details driving Q4 and the full year 2023 Results, notable capital management items, and end with our initial outlook for fiscal year 2024. For the quarter, GAAP revenue increased 11% and non-GAAP increased 8%. Delivering solid results in the fourth quarter, we closed out a strong year for our business as full-year 2023 non-GAAP revenue grew 8% to over $2 billion. Now let's look more closely at the quarter details. Firstly, on a GAAP basis, services and support revenue increased 12% for the quarter and 5% for the full year. Services and Support were positively impacted during the quarter as deconversion revenue increased approximately $10 million. Despite the better-than-expected volume in Q4, full-year deconversion revenue was down approximately $22 million versus prior year and as we discussed all year, this was due to the limited market acquisition activity in our space. Of note, product delivery and services increased 27% in the quarter, driven by higher deconversion, license and hardware, and implementation-related revenue. For the full year, given the significant headwind of over 40% lower annual deconversion revenue, we're pleased with the strong growth in all other areas, resulting in a modest 2% decrease. Next, we continue to experience robust growth in our product - in our private and public cloud offering, which increased 10% in the quarter and for the full year. I would highlight that on a non-GAAP basis, services and support revenue grew 8% for the quarter and 7% for the year. Finally, shifting to processing revenue, we saw consistent strength with 10% growth on a GAAP basis for the quarter and the year, and on a non-GAAP basis, healthy growth of 9% for the quarter and the year. Noted on previous calls, performance continues to be driven by higher card volumes and services and robust digital demand. Next, moving to operating expenses. I'll begin with the cost of revenue which was up 8% for the fourth quarter and full year roughly tracking revenue performance. At a total company level, quarterly and full-year drivers were consistent and included higher direct costs, personnel costs, and amortization expenses. Similarly, R&D expense increased 13% during the quarter, mostly due to the higher personnel costs and internal license fees used to drive innovation. Based on the same drivers, these expenses increased 15% for the full year. And lastly, SG&A rose 9% for the quarter and 8% for the year driven by increases in personnel-related costs, reflecting talent market conditions. We continue to deliver savings across the company stemming from our disciplined focus on prioritization and efficiency. I'm happy to report a 22% increase in net income, driven by operations and increased deconversion revenue, resulting in a fully diluted earnings per share of $1.34 for the quarter. We appreciate the collective contributions of our hardworking and dedicated associates that drove strong quarterly and full-year results. Now let's turn to reviewing cash flow and capital allocation. Across the year, we faced large headwinds impacting cash flow, and therefore, our full-year operating cash flow at $382 million was down from $505 million posted last year. Impacting the decline was lower deconversion revenue, higher prepaid expenses, and legislative changes to the deductibility of development expenses, which shifted the timing of tax payments. Consistent with operating cash flow factors, we produced free cash flow of $203 million. Subsequent to fiscal '23, we have paid down our debt by an additional $75 million to $200 million. Regarding capital management, our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. We're fully committed to our disciplined approach, which includes investing in our business, maintaining a strong balance sheet, pursuing high-return acquisitions where appropriate, and returning capital to shareholders. This consistent dedication to value creation resulted in an annual return on invested capital at 21.7%, and I would highlight that for the full fiscal year, we returned over $172 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. So with that, I'll conclude with guidance for the fiscal year 2024. As you're aware, yesterday's press release included fiscal 2024 full-year GAAP guidance along with the reconciliation to non-GAAP guidance metrics. As a reminder, we filed an 8-K on August 3, which described how starting in the current fiscal year we're using a revised approach for deconversion revenue. Of note, we've moved to deconversion revenue estimates in line with the recent historical low and with that framing in mind for fiscal year 2024, we're guiding to $16 million evenly distributed across the year. Additionally, approximately 10 days prior to our quarterly earnings release, we will pre-release actual deconversion revenue figures, so that your models may be updated. This will allow us to focus our quarterly call on results from operations. And going forward, each quarter we will update guidance based on actual deconversion revenue which is expected to likely exceed the beginning full-year estimate. It's important to note the negative impact of this change. Based on the new approach, full-year GAAP EPS guidance will understate anticipated EPS growth since deconversion revenue was $32 million in fiscal year 2023. Pay close attention to the impact of GAAP EPS of $0.01 per $1 million of deconversion revenue using current share count. Based on current trends, we expect to see minimal fiscal institutional consolidation in the first half of fiscal '24 with possible acceleration in the second half. Additionally important, in 2024 there will be a one-time impact from a Voluntary Early Departure Incentive Program, VEDIP for short, that was initiated at the start of this fiscal year. As Dave mentioned, the program opens pass for employees to move into more senior positions. The financial impact from VEDIP for fiscal year 2024 is $17 million to $18 million in severance-related costs which will have an approximate negative $0.18 impact on our reported GAAP EPS. All of which will be in our Q1 results. Lastly, related to our latest acquisition, Payrailz has been successfully integrated into our payment segment. Therefore we will not provide specific metrics for FY '24, and as a reminder, our financials will reflect two months of related non-GAAP results. Going forward for FY '23 and '24, non-GAAP results reflect 10 months of Payrailz aligned with the September first acquisition date. We expect full-year Payrailz revenue to more than double and become EBITDA positive starting in the first half and continuing to ramp for the full year. Based on current momentum, strong execution and near-term visibility, we should generate 6.3% to 7.3% for full-year GAAP revenue growth for fiscal '24. And, I would highlight non-GAAP revenue growth expectations, a 7.0% to 8.0%, consistent with our recent Investor Day discussions. To be helpful as it pertains to the expected cadence of non-GAAP revenue growth, we currently see Q1 being the low-point of the year at approximately 6.4% to 6.6% then a sizable increase in Q2 with sequential increases in Q3 and Q4. We will update this trend if we see changes. Driven by a combination of our year-over-year growth and continued focus on cost efficiency, we will deliver margin expansion in 2024. At a total company level for the full year, we expect non-GAAP margin expansion of 20 basis points to 25 basis points. We expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 24% and we will provide updated guidance during the year, if applicable. Incorporating these discussed impacts, full-year guidance for GAAP EPS is $4.92 to $4.99 per share. And as a reminder, the conservative guidance for deconversion revenue the VEDIP severance-related costs, and the non-recurring gain on asset disposals, results in approximately $0.39 headwind assuming deconversion fees consistent with fiscal '23. The expected trend of our quarterly GAAP EPS is consistent with current estimates where Q1 and Q4 are the best-performing quarters with slightly lower results in Q2 and Q3. Additionally, on last year's Q1 call, we said we expected expenses related to our 2023 client conference to remain in Q1. However, instead, we will be hosting our clients in October 2023 and the related cost impact will be in our fiscal Q2. Also of note, for fiscal 2024, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 60% impacted by the higher one-time capital expenses, lower guidance deconversion revenue, and continuing high cash taxes from last year has changed in the deductibility of development-related expenses, the trend to increasingly higher prepaid, both for sales commissions and third-party relationships. Looking beyond this year to provide near term target, we expect non-GAAP revenue growth of 7% to 8%, as discussed at Investor Day in May, and we see annual non-GAAP margin expansion of 20 basis points to 40 basis points. These targets are based on stable economic conditions and do not incorporate potential significant macroeconomic headwinds. So in closing, 2023 with a strong year for our business and I'm energized about the opportunities ahead. We thank all our investors for their continued confidence in Jack Henry. Anthony, will you please open the call for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question will come from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. You may now go ahead. Peter Heckmann : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if, Dave, you could characterize in terms of record bookings for the fourth quarter and full year. I guess, could you characterize a little bit about year-over-year growth there as well as the attainment of your internal targets? David Foss : Peter, well, yes, thanks for the question, Pete. We don't - in the metrics that we use internally are not external metrics, so whenever I talk about year-over-year comparison or quarter-to-quarter comparison of the sales organization, it is comparing our performance to ourselves. There isn't an external number that I quote, but it is - the fourth quarter was significantly higher than the second quarter, which was a record. And then, of course, then for the year, it was significantly higher. The thing that I think it's important to note, I get the question once in a while as we set records, people assume that that's all tied to the core business and it's not. We have a number of other complementary solutions now that are really driving significant progress for Jack Henry. The other thing that's important to note is almost nothing that we sell today is the recognized - is the revenue recognized in the quarter that where we sell that deal are - oftentimes even in the next quarter. It's almost all recurring revenue, it's all layered in setting us up for continued growth into the future, which is what builds the confidence for meaning to say, in top-line revenue growth, 7% to 8% for the foreseeable future. That's because we have so much visibility into all these deals that are being layered onto the recurring revenue stack that we already have. So the best I can do Pete and I'm not trying to be evasive, but the best I can do is just say using the internal metrics that we use, it was a significant increase in Q4 over any of the other quarters that we've ever experienced at Jack Henry. Peter Heckmann : Okay, okay, that's fair. And then, just confirming, so the early retirement program I believe you called it VEDIP, meaning that $0.18 is included in your full-year GAAP EPS guidance and you expect to record the full $0.18 in the first quarter, did I hear that correctly? Mimi Carsley : That is correct. You heard it correctly. It will all occur in Q1 and it is an estimate. We are just kind of very at the tip of that program in terms of knowing the participation rate, but we do feel good about the estimate which is a little different than the last time we had the program in 2018, because by this point, people have kind of acknowledge their desire to participate, but all of that is already included in our guidance. Peter Heckmann : Okay. David Foss : And you may - just to chime in Pete, you may recall, we had done this twice before - since I've been at Jack Henry anyway, twice before, this has been a very successful exercise for us in the past and not only giving - rewarding people who have been here for a long time but also creating opportunities for people to move up in the organization. And so we expect that same level of success with the program this time. Peter Heckmann : Good to hear. I appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Nik Cremo with Credit Suisse. You may now go ahead. Nik Cremo : Hi, congrats on the strong results, and thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to ask about what drove the strong revenue growth in the core segment. And if there was anything one - more of one time in nature, such as the convert merge revenue or license sales that we should be aware of for FY '24? Mimi Carsley : I can take that question. Thanks, Nik. So, no, I would say, overall, it's a continuation of a strong product lineup as Dave mentioned, a robust pipeline there was if anything lower convert merge activity in our space. But overall, it was just continuing to be driven by cloud strong being continue to be driven by just implementation timing and the size of those kind of clients. So it is a little variable from quarter to quarter but overall, core had strong quarters throughout the year of FY '23. Nik Cremo : Okay, thanks. And then for my follow-up, would it be possible to provide '24 guidance at the segment level for non-GAAP revenue growth? Mimi Carsley : We don't provide at the segment level guidance, but we can kind of follow-up that I would say, it's consistent with both the growth algorithm and the revenue growth for FY '23, we would say is consistent for '24 trends. Nik Cremo : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Rayna Kumar with UBS. You may now go ahead. Rayna Kumar : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to dig into deeper on the non-GAAP operating margin guide - for FY '24. Mimi, you gave some good detail on if you adjust for Payrailz in both years, margins would be up 20 basis points, but should we think of the 20 bps has been more as then more normalized margin trajectory here and maybe just talk a little bit about the puts and takes of the 20 basis points? Thank you. Mimi Carsley : Thank you, Rayna. So, we tried to clarify both the impact for short-term guidance as well as long-term sustainability of guidance. So, for FY '24, you're correct. We're giving guidance about 20 basis points to 25 basis points. There's a little bit of a headwind from the bonus because the bonus was lower in 2023 restarting the clock at 100% accruals. There is a bit of a headwind, about a $6 million headwind from just both the growth and the refilling if you will of that bonus pool. There's also some third-party renewals and continued investment in areas like cyber and security compensation. So all of those are drivers to both 2024, but longer-term, we definitely see the sustainability of 20 bps to 40 bps of margin. Rayna Kumar : Got it. That's really helpful. And then just on free cash flow, I noticed it was down for the quarter. What were the drivers of that? And would you anticipate improvement in free cash flow in FY '24? Mimi Carsley : Yes. So on free cash flow, Rayna, I'd really recommend looking on an annual basis versus quarterly, because there can just be some, like, seasonality bids and, you know, with prepaid changing and just the timing of when we - even sometimes impacting annual based on the annual maintenance bills that go out in the summer-time, sometimes people pay in June, sometimes they pay in July, and so sometimes that can have a year-over-year impact, but we did have some noteworthy kind of headwind in 2023 from a free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. In particular, the largest being that change in the tax legislation around the deductibility of development-related expenses led to a $90 million cash tax payment. Now that doesn't go away in '24, that will still stay at a somewhat elevated level. Over the five years that does kind of reverse course but that will continue to present some headwind to '24 and beyond kind of near-term free cash flow. If I think about kind of a walk on the free cash flow and the free cash flow conversion for 2023, if deconversion revenue were about the same as '22, that's about, call it, roughly $20 million. There is asset sales and then the $90 million of taxes, you get to - closer to like a $280 million to $290 million of free cash, which would have been more of a round free cash flow conversion of about 85% versus the reported 55%. Rayna Kumar : Understood. Thank you. Mimi Carsley : Very welcome. Operator : Our next question will come from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital. You may now go ahead. Dan Perlin : Thanks. Good morning. And Dave, I just wanted to revisit the - you know the sales pipeline and demand environment in aggregate I mean you set records in three quarters or four quarters this year, which is pretty amazing, especially considering the backdrop. So some of that obviously is coming from movement over to the cloud, but, a lot of that also is coming from just competitive dynamics. And so I wonder if you could just speak to what you're seeing in the market today? How you guys think you're positioned relative to peers, because the commentary clearly coming from others is a very different narrative. So if you could just put a finer point on that, I'd appreciate it. David Foss : Thanks, Dan. It is - that's an interesting time in our environment and I know many of you follow the segment very closely. As far as Jack Henry has positioned or how we're positioned today, we're well-known as being very focused in our space and I think that's getting us - that's getting us a lot of attention right now. And when I say focused on our space, I mean, being a well-rounded technology provider to financial institutions in the United States and we're not in the merchant acquiring business. We're not doing other things. We are focused on the needs of those customers that we have served traditionally and we continue to serve the community and regional banks, credit unions that you all know. And so, if you put that together with the customer service reputation that we have at Jack Henry and the innovative things that we're doing now, I just talked about in the script, the new products that we're rolling out here that we've - couple of them now the summer and a couple more yet to come this year. The settling-in of the technology modernization story I started talking about that in February of last year. But over the course of the year, people have really had a chance to absorb that and understand how differentiated it is what Jack Henry is doing as compared to anybody else in our space has differentiated that solution will be and we're not fully in market yet, but I think when you roll all those things together, Jack Henry has this positioning now, that is - that's really credible as far as our potential customers and existing customers are concerned. Now it is still - for banks and credit unions, making a major change in technology is still a very hard decision. So it's not like people are rushing to our doors and ready to sign-up with Jack Henry, but there's kind of this really nice slow steady movement towards Jack Henry because of all of those things and I think they have all really helped draw a bright line between what Jack Henry is doing and what anybody else in our space is doing and people are recognizing that. Dan Perlin : Yes. It's been pretty consistent on that message so. Just a quick follow-up in terms of this one-time impact on the early departure incentive program. I certainly appreciate the charge. Can you talk about what the run-rate cost-savings are associated from or expected to be associated from the, I guess, the group of individuals going to take that package and how much is that influencing the margin expansion on the core base of 20 basis points and 25 basis points? Thank you. Mimi Carsley : Thanks, Dan. Appreciate the question. Unfortunately, as we said, we just signed some final agreements. It's still early days. We're working with our managers to be diligent to be thoughtful about those positions. We do expect a small amount of net savings, but we're not doing this just as the savings program. As Dave said, this is part of our culture and this is a great way to just retain talent, grow talent. And so it is not part of our guidance in terms of in-year savings. We're being conservative at this point. Dan Perlin : Okay, that's super helpful. Thank you, Mimi. Mimi Carsley : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question will come from Vasu Govil with KBW. You may now go ahead. Vasu Govil : Hi, thank you for taking my questions and great results. Mimi, first question for you, I guess just on the long-term margin expansion, which you said we should think of normalized year as 20 basis points to 40 basis points of the expansion. I think historically we've been accustomed to thinking about that being more in the 50 basis points plus range. So, I was wondering if you could help us think through what's changed there and the trajectory. Mimi Carsley : Thank you, Vasu, for the question. I think, a part of it is what is normal, and the last several years have been, some ups and downs. We got great benefits from really the COVID-related lack of travel, some - then we saw some of the great recession, now we've seen inflation, so some of that is really modeling out what is to be expected from just the ongoing engine of the business. We're continuing to see, even though CPI and inflation is subsiding, we're continuing to see wage-related, employee-related, benefits cost, insurance costs, third-party renewal costs, continued investment in fiber, and so. You know, I think there is continued opportunity for margin expansion through the migration to cloud from on-prem hopefully through continued exciting products that we have, including our tech modernization. But at this point, probably safer to say 20 basis points to 40 basis points in the very near term. Vasu Govil : That's helpful. And then, David, I have a longer-term question for you on AI. It'd be great if you could share your thoughts on where you are seeing the community banks are in terms of thinking about adopting AI and what role do you think Jack Henry could play as that starts to become a bigger reality. David Foss : Yes, Vasu, I'm happy to talk about it although Greg is sitting here. I'll ask Greg to chime in. So first off, I think for most community regional banks and credit unions, for most of them, they are talking about it, thinking about trying to figure out how does this play into what they do. But, I don't know of many that have a defined strategy today. They're still trying to figure out, is this a good thing or a - or potentially risks their environment. As for Jack Henry, so if you think about AI, it's important, I think, to include in that broader conversation, the idea of machine learning and robotic process automation, which Jack Henry - all three of those areas, Jack Henry has been in that business for a long-time. So you look at several of the solutions that we offer today, we have those types of technologies embedded in those solutions. I know when people talk AI today, it's usually about ChatGPT and about the idea of using it to write software and all that kind of stuff and we're certainly investigating those things. But we have been in this space for quite some time and leveraging these tools for some time. And I'll ask Greg to kind of share with you some of the detail around some of those things that we already do and that we're working on today. Gregory Adelson : Yes, so just to add to that, Vasu, I think a couple of key things. So on the robotic process improvement, our automation side, we're using that in our continuous improvement initiatives. So all the things that we're doing around the company to improve processes, put things in place that where there could be automated, we're using that type of technology to help there, couple of our key products that Dave has already mentioned on the call, but what we're doing in our Financial Crimes Defender has significant artificial intelligence components to it, things that we've done in our pay center offering and what we do to fight fraud in that world as well as that. So, our CTO office in many of us across the organization are working together to evaluate some of the key players in the space. We really think the FinTech world is going to grow significantly in this space over the coming years. And so we're spending a lot of time looking at those companies for opportunities to partner and-or other things in the future. Vasu Govil : Thank you very much. That was very helpful. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. You may now go ahead. Jason Kupferberg : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back on free cash flow just thinking beyond this year, Mimi, I know you made some comments, just around the tax law changes. I think you said there is a five-year duration around that which I guess, started in year F '23. So free cash flow conversion, I know, is 60% for F '24, is that kind of a baseline zip code to think about for the next few years beyond fiscal '24? I just want to make sure we have our expectations properly calibrated there. Thanks. Mimi Carsley : Thank you, Jason. So yes, for FY '24, we are giving guidance of 60% that does incorporate the sustained higher cash tax levels related to the Section 174 legislative change. It does reverse, so to speak, over the five-year period and kind of neutralizes itself as higher cash upfront less later on. We're continuing to do analysis on the long-term, what is the target. As we shift our business model from severance, several years ago, when we are more of a license and maintenance model and targeted 100%, but now it's more of a SaaS model. You have less dollars every year from an annual maintenance perspective and more of a continual - from a revenue recognition, long-term contracts basis. So between that and our capital spend and looking at all of the drivers of free cash flow, we're thinking about what is the appropriate target to have and will share with you that. I would say it's likely to be over, you know, the FY '24 guidance, but, we - it's a little early to say. But, I think the long-term drivers are certainly better than the FY '23 free cash flow story. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, okay. Understood. And then just coming back on the quarterly cadence of non-GAAP revenue growth. I know you highlighted Q1 being the trough of being below the full-year outlook. It sounds like will Q2 be above the full-year range and then we move kind of back into the range in the back half of F '24, and if you can just walk us through what's actually driving some of that quarterly fluctuation? Thanks. Mimi Carsley : Yes. Yes, happy to add a little color to that. So yes, as we gave guidance, we wanted to be - normally we're not in the market of giving real specific Q1 guidance, but we wanted to make sure because Q1 is, you know, I would say modestly lower than the full year. We wanted it to be more specific to be helpful to you all. So Q1 will be the lowest quarter, significantly I would say relatively since we're tracking kind of six-handle versus it's the full-year of 7% to 8%. But the Q2 will be more, I think, in line with the average for the growth for the year as well Q3 and then Q4 usually is a little bit higher than that. Jason Kupferberg : Right. And how much it's driving the fluctuations, like, why is Q1 lower? Mimi Carsley : You know, sometimes it's just the comps based on prior year, sometimes, it's just the seasonality of when implementations happen or product releases in any particular year, but historically Q1 has always been our lowest quarter and Q4 has always been our highest quarter. That's just the seasonality of our business. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, thanks, Mimi. Mimi Carsley : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question will come from John Davis with Raymond James. You may now go ahead. John Davis : Hi, good morning, guys. Mimi, just wanted to follow up a little bit on the margins, you called out kind of lower bonus payments this year about $6 million. So if I look at that, that would kind of gets you to the high-end or even above the 20 basis points to 40 basis points. I think it's about 25 basis point headwind this year. And how much of the benefit are you including in that 20 basis points to 25 basis points from the kind of the early departure program that you have or is that kind of upside. Just trying to understand kind of the drivers and kind of why we're on the low end, it's just the bonuses this year? Any color there would be helpful. Mimi Carsley : Yes, thanks, JD. So if I understand the question correctly, as it pertains to FY '24, so, the $6 million that I referenced is both have blended just the natural annual growth based on merit and hiring, et cetera, about 50% of it, and the other 50% is based on the change from FY '23 is lower bonus payment to the full replenishment, if you will, in FY '24. We at the moment, we have nothing baked-in from a savings perspective into the guidance related to the VEDIP program for 2024. John Davis : Okay, I know - that's super helpful. And then, Dave, just wanted to touch on both the demand environment. I heard obviously 16 wins, new wins this quarter, you know, that's an acceleration. Just what you're hearing from customers, I think people were concerned, a handful of months ago about all the disruption in kind of the banking sector. It almost seems like it had the opposite impact and has forced people to kind of accelerate plans as they try and become more efficient over time. So just curious what you're hearing there from customers, but then also competitively, like a lot of these I think smaller startups have run out of cash or people are unwilling to kind of fund continual losses, some of your bigger competitors may be still distracted with other businesses. So from our view, it seems like the competitive environment is probably the best it's been in a while, but just curious, need your thoughts there. David Foss : Yes, JD. I would say the competitive environment is probably the best it's been for quite a while. It's not that, as I said before, it's not that people are rushing into the door at Jack Henry and, say, let me in, I want to sign a - I can sign the contract, but we certainly saw no negative impacts during all the flurry of activity here back-in March with the shutdowns of some of those specialized regional banks that did not slow us down at all. I don't know that I would attribute a pickup in sales activity to anything to do with that. What I think is driving this is, and we just published our benchmark survey a month ago or so, and it was very clear in that survey, which by the way available online on jackhenry.com, it was very clear in that survey that customers today are looking for technology to help with revenue growth, deposit growth, and efficiency. Those are the three, by far, the three top areas of concern. Well, if you're looking to grow revenue, meaning deposit - or deposit, sorry, it was deposit growth, loan growth, and efficiency. If you're looking to grow deposits, you're not hoping that people will come into your branch and open a new account, they're going to do that online. How do you do that? Technology from Jack Henry. If you're looking to grow a loan volume in the commercial lending space are these small-business borrowers wanting to drive to your branch and sit down and talk, you know, they're looking online for those funding sources? Jack Henry provides that technology. If you're looking for efficiency in the back-office, is that just process re-engineering, it might be, but oftentimes process re-engineering involves technology. We have those tools. And so given those three major focuses for CEOs today, Bank and Credit Union, Jack Henry provides solutions to all of those problems that they're facing. And as I mentioned earlier, we are known in our space as the most focused on these concerns that our customers have. We only focus on serving financial institutions in the domestic US market and we have tied that together with the reputation for service and for being a great partner. I think all of those things together are what's driving the key interest in Jack Henry. But then as you point out, the competitive environment today, probably, better than it's been in a very long-time and we're taking advantage of that as much as we can. John Davis : Okay. Mimi, one final question, just to follow up on Jason's kind of free cash flow. So if I'm hearing, I think what you're trying to say is, near-term, probably closer to that 60% ish level that you've guided for '24, but over time, maybe we get back closer to the 85% that '23 would have been ex-tax and kind of what other time items, is that the right way to kind of think about cash flow over the next several years? Mimi Carsley : I think that's a reasonable approach to thinking about it. John Davis : Okay, all right. Thanks for all the color. Operator : Next question will come from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. You may now go ahead. Dominick Gabriele : Hi, great. Good morning, everybody. I was just curious if we could dive a little bit more into the employee cost conversation. And if you're seeing, if you could kind of pick apart existing employee cost increases versus new higher employee cost increases. And which type of positions are putting pressure, when we think about SG&A expense as a percentage of adjusted revenue, any color on there would be really helpful and then I just have a follow-up. Thanks so much. Gregory Adelson : Hi, this is Greg. I'll start with some of that. So, I think if you look at what we've been doing and what we've - Dave has been talking about around the tech modernization strategy, you can definitely point to things that we're adding where a lot of times in the past several years ago we were doing more partnerships and instead, we're now building all this technology. So if you look at development, QA, resources, project management resources, things along that, those are all, in some cases additive to what we've been doing in the past. So again that ties into some of the margin discussion as well that, you know, with some of the questions that have come up. We're adding quality people. The good news is there's been a - in the industry, there's been a lot of quality people laid-off from other companies and we're able to go and pick a lot of those folks up and drive the business. So that's been a big part of our opportunity to bring on that type of talent and it's really tied to the tech modernization strategy in general. And then Mimi anything you want to add in there? Mimi Carsley : Yes. I would say, you know, we're continuing to be mindful and thoughtful on headcount increases. I would say, it's been very modest across the board where we've had more concentration in the development engineering folks, the call center folks, client-facing. But for the rest of the organization, we've really been scaling back and being thoughtful on the growth. Part of that Dom is, salaries and benefits increasing, you know, with market. Part of that is also the labor cost deferral as some of these products now come online and amortization you start to see at some of these products and/or now GA and in the market. So, we can provide probably more color later, but that's at a high level the way I would guide you towards. Dominick Gabriele : Excellent. Thank you so much for all that to both of you. So and then, Dave, 47 core wins for the year. I know you talked, is about 1-ish a week, it's pretty close to that with the fact that you've gotten obviously multiple billion-dollar-plus wins. Maybe you could just talk to us about the expectation that you have given the pipeline about the win rate and the size of win rate next year versus this year? David Foss : Yes, Dominick, I still have that same general expectation, but around one week, so, 1-ish week, I think is a good pace for us. We have definitely been moving up in size over the last several years, and so, I think the expectation that we would have more of those larger institutions is a reasonable expectation. So I think more of the same as what you should expect in the future. Now we'll see what happens with the competitive environment, whether or not it creates more opportunity than we've been seeing in the past to do core replacements, but I think the assumption - that is a reasonable assumption right now is that 1-ish a week that we've been running at for quite some time. Dominick Gabriele : Perfect. Thanks so much. David Foss : Sure. Operator : Next question will come from Cris Kennedy with William Blair. You may now go ahead. Cristopher Kennedy : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Mimi, can you talk about some of the levers that you have in the business to support that 20 basis points to 40 basis points of annual margin expansion over time? Mimi Carsley : Sure, Cris. So I think the drivers of margin expansion are similar to what they've been historically. You have the tailwind of the on-premise to cloud migration. We expect after that, there are also be people leapfrogging to the public cloud. So even though we're at roughly 70% on the hosted environment, there is more it's just has been a stable clip every year of continuing and Dave talked about some of those wind counts of continued migrations. And then some of those people will migrate to public cloud and then will leapfrog straight to public cloud. So that certainly at attractive margins. I think some of the things we're doing around the development approach will also lead to margin savings using the origin and tech modernization, common components, common workflows, common testing, Greg's organization has done just an amazing job to think through really streamlining that our approach to engineering and I think that will also lead to some longer-term benefits for our organization. I would also categorize, like, the current, call it, last, you know, couple of years and next couple of years is, a rebuild in terms of setting us for the future. A lot of the development work we're doing, a lot of the infrastructure work we're doing, even on Culture and Development, I think about my own team in finance putting in some tools and systems that will allow us to support the business as it scales. So, I think those investments will eventually kind of tail off now and will go to zero. Now we will continue to invest in cyber and security every year to fortify our infrastructure and that of our clients, but I do think in general, we will start to flatten out on some of these, but some of it is a question because we do have a lot of third-party relationships and so not all of our costs are within our own control. So that is sending a bit of a headwind in the near-term and unknown in terms of, like, the longer-term on that. Cristopher Kennedy : Great. Thank you. And then, Dave, just a longer-term question and it wasn't really discussed at the Investor Day, but talk about Jack Henry's potential role within the business-to-business payments market and kind of what the assets you have and what your strategy is. Thank you. David Foss : Yes. So thanks, Cris, and I - many of you know that that's a topic that I've been really interested in for quite some time. It was one of the reasons for the Payrailz acquisition. It wasn't a driver certainly but because Payrailz had that technology included, no customers live, nobody up and running, but it is an opportunity I think for us in the long term. So as we look at that business and I'll ask Greg to chime in here and describe a little bit more, but the key thing for me is, as we think about that business, as we move into that business in the future, we want to make sure that it's a business where we can work through our customers, not compete with our customers. Meaning, go to a bank or even a Credit Union for some of these smaller institutions that are bank by Credit Union, go to the bank and work through them to serve their small-medium business customers with that type of technology and I'll ask Greg to clarify some of that or chime in. Gregory Adelson : Yes, sure. So there's a couple of things. So one, as Dave mentioned, we do have some assets today that give us a little bit of opportunity in the B2B space, but to your point, Cris, this has been a strategic endeavor of ours. We're actually very close to releasing some key assets that we think are going to be part of this strategy, we've been building some things in the background. So we're not ready to fully unleash it at this point in time, but I can tell you it is top-of-mind and we think much less Dave just described that the way we will be able to do this is through the institutions, you'd leveraging some of our digital tools, some of our payment assets, and things like that that have already been created to go out into the market. So, there'll be more news on that in the upcoming months. Cristopher Kennedy : Great, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. You may now go ahead. Ken Suchoski : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a follow-up on some of the questions from earlier around free cash flow and margin expansion. Can you guys just comment on how the shift to the cloud impacts your overall cost structure from an OpEx versus CapEx perspective? I guess said differently, where should we expect to see the increase in cloud vendor and cyber security cost flow through and what are some of the offsetting factors to that as you continue moving away from the on-prem offering? Mimi Carsley : Thanks, Ken, for the question. So I would say at a high level, as people can migrate from on-prem to cloud, they do so at essentially like a net neutral to the FI institution, but a much higher revenue to Jack Henry. And you might say why are they paying us more of that on that, it's because they are now saving from having to support their whole - own infrastructure, their own security, their own staffing. And so it's a way for the FI to focus on their core value of engaging and serving their account holders and members and allowing us to help them with this element. When that happens, it's a very minimal infrastructure additive infrastructure and people-related costs. Yes, every once in a while you'll need a new rack or new server, but more so that it have comes at a very healthy margin. So that's been a tailwind, that's been occurring for many years, we expect it to still have probably a seven-year to eight-year runway. And then on top of that, we'll see how the pace of moving to the public cloud and continues to improve that or leapfrog that as I said previously. So that helps from a margin perspective, you will continue to see us invest in maintaining and upgrading our own data centers - potential data center we have with partners. You'll see some of that cap spend, kind of, for example, next year, that's part of our free cash flow. There should be roughly probably $20 million in data center-related infrastructure that we're doing. So you'll see that probably in chunkiness of times when we're doing a big overhaul or move of a data center, but the year-in year-out is a modest investment. Ken Suchoski : Okay, great, that's helpful, Mimi. And then, I just had a question on the early retirement program that you're pursuing. Can you just talk about your headcount growth plans over the coming years? Is this of program that's more of a one-and-done type of deal? I mean overall headcount growth - overall headcount actually go down after this program is completed. Any thoughts there would be great. Mimi Carsley : Yes. So it's only pertains to people who meet that criteria and I noticed no one said the full name, everyone loved the short name. I love saying Voluntary Early Incentive Program because it's a great name. But only a small percentage of our population is eligible. It ties both the age and tenure of the company. So roughly, we probably have around 160 employees out of our over 7,000 employee population that are going to participate in it. So it doesn't create any significant changes from a headcount perspective. And then next year, we're going to continue to invest in our people and hiring where it's needed in the business, but you won't see huge growth numbers next year. Greg? Gregory Adelson : Yes. I think I'll add. So I think we zero-base every role that we have and we will do the exact same that we do here. So basically, looking at the role of determining its value for the future. Again, as Dave mentioned, a lot of these opportunities are going to create levels of folks that will be able to move up in the organization and we may not need to backfill that particular position. There could be opportunities where we actually move those positions over to other roles that are growing our businesses that are growing and taking those resources that way. So there's a lot of that evaluation that's going on as we speak and it has been mentioned, but the ideal goal is that we would have some opportunity there to improve our headcount and in some cases, less than the headcount, but we're very diligent in that process at all times again we zero-base every single role. Mimi Carsley : Yes. And, I would just add for just a little bit more color there. For FY '23, headcount increased around 3% and if you take Payrailz out of it, it was a 2% growth. So while we are very selective in making investments in our people and hiring, it's not been a large number. Ken Suchoski : Okay, great. Thank you both. Gregory Adelson : Sure. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vance Sherard for any closing remarks. Vance Sherard : Thank you, Anthony. We look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming multiple investor events during September. We are pleased with the quarterly results and again thank all Jack Henry associates for their efforts. We appreciate you joining us today, and Anthony, will you please provide the replay number? Operator : The replay number for today's call is 877-344-7529 and the access code is 7033565. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vance Sherard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Vance Sherard : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today is : David Foss, Board Chair and CEO; Mimi Carsley, CFO and Treasurer; and Greg Adelson, President and COO. After my opening remarks, I will turn the call over to Dave for his thoughts about the state of our business and some industry comments. After Dave concludes his comments, Greg will provide additional insight on our new solutions, Payrailz and other key initiatives at Jack Henry. Mimi will then provide insight regarding the financial results and updated guidance included in the press release issued yesterday that is available from the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website. We will then open the lines for Q&A. As a reminder, this call includes certain forward-looking statements including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to multiple factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to multiple risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures are in yesterday's press release. I will now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Vance. Good morning, everyone. As Vance mentioned, Greg is joining me this morning to provide an update on several innovative new solutions we've recently launched followed by Mimi who will take a deeper dive into our financial performance. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth for our company. As always, I'd like to thank our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for the quarter. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, total revenue increased 8% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. At the same time, deconversion fees were down 8% as compared to the prior year quarter. Turning to the segments. We had another solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 8% for the quarter on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment again performed very well posting a 7% increase in revenue this quarter and a 6% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had another strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses with a 9% increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue. As I have discussed previously, the first quarter is normally our lightest sales bookings quarter because our fourth quarter tends to be extremely strong and the sales pipeline is depleted as a result. As you may recall, the June quarter was the strongest sales quarter in the history of the company, so we certainly expected that historical trend to hold true. This year however, our sales pipeline was the largest ever entering a new fiscal year. In the first quarter, we booked 10 competitive core takeaways and another 10 deals to move existing in-house customers to our private cloud environment. This strong start leaves us confident that we are well positioned to achieve approximately 50 to 55 competitive takeaways this fiscal year. We continue to see success with our card processing solution signing seven new debit processing clients this quarter and two new credit clients. We also continue to see success signing clients to our Banno digital suite with 44 new contracts in Q1 including 21 contracts for our new Banno Business offering. Speaking of our digital suite, at the end of Q1, we had more than 10.5 million registered users on the platform. That number is now growing at approximately 200,000 users per month. At the end of Q1 last year, we had about 8.3 million registered users on the platform, so we've experienced a 27% increase over the past 12 months. The continued success we've seen with sales and the adoption of our digital suite is consistent with results in the Bank Director Technology Survey published in September. As they do every year, Bank Director surveyed their subscribers during June and July, regarding a variety of technology prioritization and spending topics. More than 50% of the responses they received were from bank CEOs and Board members. And more than 80% of the respondent banks have greater than $500 million in assets. Most respondents said their bank's technology budgets grew over the prior year with a median increase of 10%. That level of spending is consistent with our own Strategic Priorities Benchmark Study published last spring. Responders to the Bank Director survey named digital business account opening, payments capabilities and digital business lending as their top three planned investments. One of the interesting items from this year's Bank Director Survey was the analysis of technology and use by respondent banks, as it relates to their ability to serve different generational groups. Fully 96% of the respondents said, they have the technology in place to serve baby boomers, but only 18% said they have the necessary technology in place to effectively serve Gen Zers. Of course, it's primarily the younger generations that expect to conduct all banking services without ever entering a branch. Clearly, the innovative the initiative for all banks to get to digital presentation layer has a long way to go. All of this bodes well for the future of our digital suite, as well as the other innovative solutions offered by Jack Henry that help financial institutions facilitate an improved customer experience through a digital front door. Digital banking was one of the many topics discussed at our annual client conference held last month in Indianapolis. This is our largest conference of the year. And this year, we hosted more than 160 prospect attendees an all-time record. Of the financial institution prospects, over 30 have more than $1 billion in assets with a couple in the $10 billion to $30 billion range. Additionally, more than 250 third-party fintechs participated in the trade show, which underscores our approach to accessibility and open banking. Of course, events like this not only present a wonderful opportunity for relationship building and education, but they also generate a substantial number of new sales leads. We saw strong interest in our technology modernization strategy and our ongoing development of a single public cloud-native platform that can run the entire financial institution. We've now branded that solution as simply the Jack Henry Platform. And we were able to demonstrate some of the current functionality at the conference. In one of the most talked about main stage sessions, our Chief Technology Officer hosted an executive from Google and one of our bank CEOs to highlight the use of generative AI on the platform as well. As we normally do at Jack Henry Connect, I hosted our annual CEO forum, attended this year by nearly 150 client CEOs. Although, we didn't conduct a formal survey during the meeting, the general feedback was that while attendees are concerned about the overall economy, they continue to invest in technology to enhance their digital capabilities, improve efficiencies and position their businesses for the future. During the quarter, we were proud to be included in several national workplace rankings. We placed 11th in Newsweek's list of Top 100 Most Loved Workplaces, up six spots from last year. We also made Newsweek's Greatest Workplaces list earning five stars which is the highest possible rating. Additionally, we were named a top company in our sector by US News & World Report, based on work/life balance, stability and professional development. We are honored to be recognized in these national rankings because they reflect our people-first culture and the engagement energy collaboration and client focus that our employees bring to work each day. Next week, we'll conduct our Annual Shareholder Meeting in person in Monett. We're excited to be able to meet with our shareholders. And once again, we'll offer an option for people to observe remotely. As we move forward, I remain extremely optimistic regarding our robust sales pipeline, the demand environment, a strong interest in the solutions we're delivering and the strategies we're executing. We remain committed to our disciplined approach to running the company. And we expect that focus to continue to provide stability and solid performance for our employees, customers and shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Greg. Greg Adelson : Thank you, Dave. As we continue to execute on both our operational and technological strategic priorities, we're pleased to announce the general availability of a few new solutions in the first quarter. In addition, we continue to make outstanding progress on our technology modernization strategy and the development of our cloud-native API-first Jack Henry Platform. We will provide an update on those platform components currently in beta or going into beta on our February call. As we mentioned during the August call, our cloud-native Banno Business solution developed for small- and medium-sized businesses is now generally available for our SilverLake banking clients. And the response has been outstanding. At the end of September we had approximately 60 banks live and more than 70 additional clients in various stages of implementation. We are currently in beta with several credit union clients and plan to be generally available for that base of Jack Henry customers by the end of the calendar year. We delivered Financial Crimes Defender, our real-time fraud and anti-money laundering compliance platform, into general availability for our SilverLake banking clients in September. We also released our real-time faster payment Financial Crimes Defender fraud module for Zelle in September. The faster payment module uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect fraud and money laundering in real time. We plan to release additional Defender modules in late 2023 and early 2024 for both the FedNow and RTP networks. We currently have more than 120 clients in our implementation queue for Financial Crimes Defender, of which more than 50 include utilizing the real-time payments module. In addition, we remain on track to launch Financial Crimes Defender to our credit union clients in late December. As we also mentioned on our August call, we were among the first service providers to support live transactions on the Federal Reserve's, new FedNow instant payment network when it launched on July 20. We now have all four Jack Henry cores connected to FedNow through our PayCenter offering and continue to provide the most comprehensive implementation process requiring almost no effort from our clients to go live on the network. We currently have more than 40 clients live on FedNow with over 150 contracts in the implementation queue. We expect to have approximately 150 live customers on the network by the beginning of 2024. Today, every client is set up for receive-only. But we expect to see more clients wanting to add send capabilities in early to mid-2024 as use cases become more defined. As a matter of comparison, we have over 210 clients live on The Clearing House's RTP network and another 100 in the implementation queue. We continue to see tremendous transaction growth from our RTP clients over the past year. When comparing September 2022 to September 2023, we have realized a 66% transaction growth with the majority of these transactions stemming from digital wallet transfers to bank accounts, A2A transfers from Tier 1 institutions and payroll or gig worker payments. Speaking of payments, it's been a little more than a year since we acquired Payrailz. We have successfully integrated the team and large portions of the technology stack into our culture and technology modernization strategy. We continue to find, develop and execute additional back-office synergies while building a premier payment acceptance platform, capable of handling bill payment, P2P, A2A, B2B and much more. As part of our planned strategy, we have created one Jack Henry bill payment group that provides product and operational support for both our legacy solution iPay and for Payrailz as well. Over the next 18 months, we will finalize the build-out of a single cloud-native API-first payment platform that will include all the key features of both iPay and Payrailz as well as additional new features not offered in either solution today. Specific to Payrailz, we now have more than 100 clients live, another close to 50 clients in various stages of implementation and additional 20 that were recently signed. A question that is regularly asked, when are all these new innovative solutions going to be sold outside of the Jack Henry core base? I'm pleased to report that we have finalized our strategy to sell each of these solutions as well as components from the Jack Henry Platform to several targeted competitive cores. We have aligned our strategy with the competitive cores we believe will bring the best mutual value and have a need for premier digital fraud and real-time payment solutions. Each of our components is being developed to go outside of the Jack Henry core base and will be available to do so as they move to general availability. We expect to start selling some of these solutions early next fiscal year. On the operational side, we've been highly focused on ensuring that Jack Henry is the easiest core provider to work with in the industry. We operate with full transparency while collaborating across business units to deliver our consistent enterprise experience. We call this program One Jack Henry. And you've heard me talk about it in detail at our annual Investor Day event in the past few years. We continue to receive tremendous validation of our efforts through meetings with industry consultants, prospects, clients and our associates. Our industry-leading survey and service scores continue to move up and to the right at a time where that is not happening across our industry. Furthermore, the work we are doing around One Jack Henry is aligned with the objectives outlined by the American Bankers Association Core Platforms Committee. Those objectives include fair and transparent contracts, exceptional customer service responsive and open communication open banking and the highest standard of data protection and privacy. In closing, we all came back from our Jack Henry Connect client conference in mid-October with a little extra pep in our step after hearing from our clients and our prospects that our technology modernization strategy coupled with the work we are doing to focus on road map execution and service excellence is truly a differentiator in our industry. I want to thank all of our talented and dedicated associates for helping us move this strategy forward. We wouldn't be where we are today without them. I will now turn things over to Mimi for some detail on the numbers. Mimi Carsley : Thank you, Greg, and good morning everyone. Our continued focus on serving our community and regional financial institution clients, growing our business, investing in our future and delivering shareholder value led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. I'll begin with the details driving our positive first quarter and then conclude with our full year guidance update. We're encouraged by Q1 GAAP revenue and non-GAAP revenue increasing 8%, establishing a healthy start to our year and setting us up for a fantastic fiscal 2024. Deconversion revenue of $4.1 million, which we pre-released last week was down approximately $400,000 reflecting continued temperate financial institutional consolidation. As a reminder, given the September 1, 2022 close of Payrailz acquisition the first two months of Q1 2024 results are excluded from non-GAAP financials, but that September one onwards Payrailz results are included in both GAAP and non-GAAP. Now let's look more closely at the details. First on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis services and support revenue increased a healthy 7%. Services and support growth was the result of increases in data processing and hosting software usage and subscription and hardware. We continue to experience robust growth in our private and public cloud offerings which increased 10% in the quarter. This revenue contributor has long been a double-digit growth engine. Shifting to processing revenue. We saw vigorous performance with 10% growth on a GAAP basis and 9% growth on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter. Consistent with prior period results drivers include a combination of higher card volumes and services plus strong digital demand. Next moving to expenses. I'll begin with cost of revenue which increased 8% on a GAAP basis and 7% on non-GAAP. Drivers include higher direct costs, personnel and benefit costs and internal licenses and fees. Next, R&D expense increased 12% on a GAAP basis and 10% on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting higher personnel and benefits costs net of capitalization. This is in support of our continued solution innovation maintaining competitiveness and our technology modernization strategy including the Jack Henry Platform. Finally, on a GAAP basis SG&A rose 38% for the quarter primarily due to the $16.4 million one-time cost related to the voluntary early departure incentive program VEDIP. This cost was lower than the $17 million to $18 million estimate based on the final participation in the program. As a reminder, all VEDIP costs are in this quarter. And there will be no additional P&L impact as we move through the year. When these one-time VEDIP costs and last year's $6.2 million gain from real estate divestures are adjusted to non-GAAP SG&A decreased 2% during the quarter. These adjusted figures reflect our ongoing commitment to cost control. We remain focused on generating compounding margin expansion. And the quarter results delivered 121 basis points increase in non-GAAP margin, which was 26.1%. This increase was partially driven by the timing shift of our Connect customer conference into Q2 compared to Q1 last year. These strong quarterly results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.39. Breaking down non-GAAP results we're pleased by the consistent solid performance achieved by the three operating segments. Our core segment revenue increased 8% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis with non-GAAP operating margin increasing five basis points to 59%. We benefit from positive tailwinds from winning share, continued migration from on-premise to private cloud and customer growth. The payments segment revenue increased 7% on a GAAP basis and 6% for non-GAAP. This segment had an impressive non-GAAP operating margin growth of 59, basis to 46%. This was due to increase in card transaction and related revenues plus growth in our EPS business. The Fed recently announced its considered change -- a change to the debit card interchange that would translate to an approximate 28% decrease, in interchange for issuers. It should be noted that our revenue model for card processing is transactional and not reliant on interchange. Finally, our complementary segment, revenue increased 9% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis with strong non-GAAP operating margin expansion of 47 basis points to 61%. Our diverse mix of solutions, including key headliners like Banno, LoanVantage, Treasury Management in addition to the numerous additional solutions contribute to this strong growth trend. And our new fraud Financial Crimes Defender solution will soon contribute to the growth in this segment as well. Now let's turn to a review of cash flow and capital allocation. Quarterly operating cash flow was $157 million a $20 million increase over prior year producing free cash flow of $107 million, slightly less than the $116 million last year. Last year included $26 million contribution from asset sales that was non-reoccurring in nature. Our consistent dedication to value creation resulted in an annual return on invested capital of 20%. Additionally, I'd like to highlight notable return of capital including $20 million in share repurchases offsetting annual dilution, $30 million in debt reduction and $38 million in dividends during the quarter. With Q1 in our rear view we shift our focus to the remainder of 2024. And I will conclude with guidance change highlights. As you're aware yesterday's press release included updated fiscal 2024 full year guidance along with the reconciliation to non-GAAP guidance metrics. As a reminder, we filed an 8-K on August third that described how starting in the current fiscal year we're using a revised approach for deconversion guidance. Based on current trends we expect to see minimal financial institution consolidations in the first half of fiscal 2024 with possible acceleration in the second half. As such, we're maintaining and reiterating full year deconversion revenue guidance of $16 million. Based on a positive Q1 result from strong execution and near-term visibility we see upside over our prior guidance. We now expect to generate full year non-GAAP revenue growth of 7.2% to 8.2%, compared to the 7.0% to 8.0% provided on the August call. This corresponds to an increased full year GAAP revenue guidance of 6.4% to 7.4% for fiscal 2024. In tandem with our increased revenue outlook and continued focus on cost efficiencies, we now expect an increase in annual non-GAAP margin expansion of 30 to 35 basis points, compared to the 20 to 25 basis points previously provided. The full year tax rate remains unchanged at approximately 24%. Incorporating the noted positive updates, full year guidance for GAAP EPS is revised upward to $4.98 to $5.04 per share from previous guidance of $4.92 to $4.99 per share. As a reminder, the conservative guidance for deconversion revenue compared to actual fiscal 2023 deconversion revenue, the slightly lower VEDIP severance-related costs and the non-reoccurring gain on asset sales results in an approximate $0.37 headwind for fiscal 2024 GAAP EPS. And lastly some additional modeling commentary. As previously highlighted we recently hosted our customer conference JH Connect. The associated revenue and expenses will be reflected next quarter. Please recall in FY 2023 the related financial impact was in Q1. We believe this timing shift has led to an approximate $0.01 to $0.02 higher consensus Q2 EPS estimate. Our full year guidance of 60% free cash flow conversion remains consistent given the continued impact of tax deductibility timing on development expenses, resulting in higher cash taxes. In the relative near-term, we expect to return to historical norms of conversion. We appreciate the contributions of our hardworking and dedicated associates that drove these strong quarterly results. In conclusion, Q1 was a strong start to our fiscal year. And we remain exceptionally positive about our ability to deliver innovation and valued solutions the resiliency of our clients our focus on execution, growth accelerators, and shareholder value creation. We thank all Jack Henry investors for their continued confidence. MJ could you please open the call for questions? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Tyler DuPont : Hi, good morning everyone. This is Tyler DuPont on for Jason. Thank you for taking the question. So, I wanted to start on the growth side of things looks like growth is pretty solid across dimensions particularly on the corporate side and complementary. So I was just wondering if you can speak to kind of specifically what drove that outperformance during the quarter? And then on the other side it looks like the payments growth was healthy but a little bit lower than what's expected on the \"normalized\" growth rate of 8% to 9%. So, I just wanted to ask what dynamics you're seeing there and any expectations going forward? Thanks. David Foss : I'll take the first half and I'll let Greg respond on the payments portion. This is Dave Foss by the way. So, I think the growth when it comes to the other areas other than payments is primarily driven by the success that we're seeing now in the Banno area in the complementary product groups of the Banno product line. I highlighted some of the performance metrics there the addition of new customers and all the new registered users on that platform so the Banno platform success. Financial Crimes Defender we signed a whole bunch of contracts in the quarter. But you really won't see the P&L impact of Financial Crimes Defender until next quarter and then the following quarters after that. But then it's just a variety of other solutions again primarily in that complementary solutions area. So, we're continuing to see great success with things like treasury and some of the other complementary solutions that we didn't specifically call out. But all of them have become real nice drivers of revenue. Many of them new solutions in the past couple three years. We've highlighted them on these calls in the past as new solutions. They're not new anymore and they're a year old. But they're continuing to drive great demand and nice revenue improvement for Jack Henry. And I'll let Greg comment on what's happening in the payments side. Greg Adelson : Yes, I would say there's probably two components. So, one we're kind of dealing with the aftermath of excessive growth in our remote deposit capture business during the pandemic. And so we're seeing a little bit of lessening of that growth. And then the card volume growth I think is kind of indicative to what you've heard both card associations talk about as well. So, again, the majority of our card business is on the debit side. That business isn't growing as fast as it would just during some of the things that are going on with the economy right now. But those are the two biggest drivers I think on the payments side. Everything else is fairly in sync. Tyler DuPont : Okay, great. That's helpful. I appreciate it. And then just a follow-up. I want to shift gears to margins and just the dynamics you're seeing there across the business. It looks like during the quarter margins came in ahead or at least what we were anticipating on an adjusted basis full year as well was raised. I'd be curious to hear more about what you're seeing that drove that uplift during the quarter and thus the full year raise. And tangentially to that as well but sort of on a separate line given where we're sitting now when do you anticipate Payrailz will become margin neutral to the business? Mimi Carsley : Yes, I can take the first part of that. So, you're correct in terms of the great margin expansion we saw in Q1. Now, typically, Q1 is our largest-performing quarter from a margin basis because you have the subscription-related revenue there from a renewals perspective. But we saw higher revenue across the board which just then flowed through. I would have as a reminder though, the impact from Connect conference. The timing of that did have a pretty significant impact from the margin improvement, on a year-over-year basis. But I would say, the most part it was just the revenue flow-through and good expense control. Greg Adelson : And then Payrailz, so on the Payrailz side, so I think we are tracking to the guidance that we gave back in August. So I think everything is on track based on what we provided back in August. Tyler DuPont : Okay. Great. Appreciate the color. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 David Togut : Thank you. Good morning, Dave and Mimi. I'd just like to start with a question about, the pace of core competitive takeaways in the quarter. It looks like it fell from 16 in the June quarter which was well above trend to 10 in the current quarter. Any call-outs on the competitive environment any changes? Or was this more of a timing-related issue? David Foss : Hi. Good morning, David. It's interesting that you called that out as a negative that we went from 16 to 10. I'm thrilled with 10, because normally the first quarter is a very light quarter. Last year as a comparative, we had six in the first quarter. We tend to see a real push in the fourth quarter every year. So for us to produce 10 in the quarter was great news, as far as I was concerned. And that's what led me to say, I think 50 to 55 new wins, for this year. Based on what we saw in the first quarter and what I'm seeing in the pipeline, gives me great confidence that we're going to have a really, really strong year. Now with that said, talking about what's happening in our environment, I think all of you know pretty well what's happening in our environment with all of our competitors and some of the disruption that's happened and so on. Those types of events create opportunity for us. These are still very long sales cycles. You don't have a banker, who suddenly wakes up one day and says \"Hey, I think I'll go through a core conversion.\" They're very long. It's a very disruptive process to go through a core conversion. And so, nobody takes it lightly. But we definitely are seeing some impacts in our sales pipeline that are being produced by some of the disruption that's happening in our space around the topic of core. Q \u2013 David Togut : Got it. And then moving upmarket to the bigger banks has long been a focus area of yours. And you called out the success of treasury management, which is part of that effort to move upmarket. Can you update us on broader initiatives to move up into the bigger bank space? You started talking about this a couple of years ago, with tech modernization. Where are you in this process? And where do you expect to be within 12 18 months? David Foss : Sure. So in my prepared remarks, I pointed out that we had a couple of banks in the $15 billion to $30 billion range that were at our prospects -- I should say, that were at our client conference. I don't recall -- I've been doing this for a long time, I may have forgotten one. But I don't recall us ever having a brand-new prospect over $10 billion come to our client conference to talk to us about core. So, to have two in that range, I think is pretty indicative of the success that we're having now. And it's really being driven by tech modernization. The story that we have now and our ability to actually demonstrate things that we're doing with this new platform, is getting a lot of attention among larger institutions, because they're trying to figure out how to get to the public cloud environment and they can't see a path forward with their current provider. They see that path with Jack Henry. So, I can't predict when we'll sign one of these larger institutions, as a new client. But I think the activity right now, gives me great confidence that you'll see some announcements in the future that are of significant wins in that regional banking space. Q \u2013 David Togut : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Vasu Govil with KBW. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Vasu Govil : Hi. Thank you. for taking my questions. I guess first I just wanted to follow up on the previous question about the payments segment. Just wondering, when some of the grow-over issues from the remote deposit capture will be kind of behind us? And what should we expect for growth there for the remainder of the year? Mimi Carsley : Let me start with that. So Vasu, I would say, that the Q1 trends for the payments segment were pretty much in line with what we saw for the full year last year. And we continue to see strength in that business. So I think we're very positive and optimistic about it. It's not just transactional, there's also ancillary revenues in there in services that we continue to expand upon from a portfolio perspective. So that in itself is derisking just the exposure to transactional. Q \u2013 Vasu Govil : Thank you. So, basically, it seems like we should expect this rate 1Q rate to continue through the remainder of the year. Any puts and takes there? Mimi Carsley : I think that's a good assumption. Vasu Govil : Got it. And then a quick one for you Dave. Banno it seems has been a clear success story for you. It's been a growth driver for several years now. I'm wondering if it's big enough where you might be willing to give us more visibility on how big it is and how fast it's growing. And as you think about your total addressable market within your client base how penetrated are we there today with Banno? David Foss : Within the existing client base yes we're becoming well penetrated we're over 50%. But we still have a lot of opportunity particularly on the credit union side of our business. It's no secret we started with Banno on the banking side and really started to push hard on the banking side. We have not been as forceful maybe. We didn't have it ready on the credit union side. And we haven't been as forceful on the credit union side. But that certainly is an area of focus for us. So you'll continue to see penetration. I mean, when you have the leading digital banking solution in the industry we expect almost all of our core customers will want to consume that at one point or another because they see the differences between that and anything else in the market. As to the first part of your question, Vasu, we don't tend to try to size individual products. It's part of a segment. We provide guidance per segment. But as with everything else we do at Jack Henry, we don't try to size as far as revenue is concerned on products. I don't expect us to change that. My real goal in giving you the user counts like we have has been to try and give you as much ammunition to model effectively and kind of create your own view of what we're doing at Jack Henry. But I don't expect that we're going to start to provide revenue visibility guidance on a specific product like Banno. Vasu Govil : All right. appreciate the color. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Kartik Mehta : Good morning. Maybe just on free cash flow. I know you said still anticipate about 60% for the year. I'm wondering is it just timing that it's in the first quarter was this good? Or do you think now maybe that 60% might be a little conservative as we go throughout the year? Mimi Carsley : Good morning, Karthik. I would say that the quarterly cadence can sometimes be choppy. Our Q1 is always a very strong cash flow quarter. We have the annual maintenance and other strong cash flows coming in Q1. So I would say this year might be more of a U shape than anticipated maybe a little bit more steep than last year. But we're still on track and optimistic about that 60%. Kartik Mehta : And then Dave, just I'm sure banks are talking about AI just like every other business. And I'm wondering at JHA Connect if that was a topic that was discussed. And if so if there are ways where Jack Henry could help banks that want to maybe use AI. David Foss : Yes. So definitely a topic. Everybody who's anybody seems to be talking about AI these days and trying to figure out what they're talking about as they're talking about it. So, two things to keep in mind here. There's two flavors of AI. There's the kind of traditional artificial intelligence/machine learning version of AI. And then there's generative AI the new kind of hot topic ChatGPT if you will. So we've been deploying traditional AI for many years. So we've had artificial intelligence and machine learning baked into our Banno solution that's baked into our call center solution. And we do a lot with that and have for quite some time. And especially in our fraud area, we use that technology. So we've been demoing that and been able to talk about it effectively for quite some time. The new twist is with generative AI. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we show generative AI working on the Google platform with our platform solution at the Connect conference. So we had one main stage session. Our Chief Technology Officer was onstage with an executive from Google and a bank CEO, who by the way is a beta customer for us. He specifically made the trip to Connect so he could be onstage and talk about what our generative AI solution -- what he thinks it's going to do to change the operating environment for their bank. We're not in production with that yet. This is beta. But we definitely expect that we'll be a player in that space and we'll be able to help our customers using generative AI. And of course the good news is with the Jack Henry Platform it's all written on the Google Cloud. And Google has we believe the best gen AI solution in the market, partly because they have guaranteed they'll protect PII so private information, as we roll this out. And so we're very bullish on the opportunity for the future to use that technology to help our customers. Kartik Mehta : Okay. Thanks, Dave. I appreciate it. David Foss : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from John Davis with Raymond James. Please go ahead. John Davis : Hi. Good morning, guys. Mimi, I just wanted to follow-up on free cash flow. I believe you made a comment that you expect to return to normal historical levels from a free cash flow conversion perspective. And I was just curious, is it still kind of in the three to four years once we lap the non-deductibility of R&D expense? Just want to clarify that comment about returning to historical levels. Mimi Carsley : Great question JD. If I had a crystal ball for Washington, I'd probably be in a little bit of a different role. But we're hopeful that there might be a consideration of changing the legislative nature of that tax deductibility of development expenses. You're starting to hear more and more technology companies, talk about the negative impact to them. If that -- and we're not banking on that happening. If that does not occur, I would agree with you at this point I would say a couple of years out, hopefully more than four so -- but for right now we feel pretty comfortable for this year sticking with the 60% guidance. David Foss : And JD, if I can tack on this is Dave. So I just want to add a little clarity to everybody out there. One of the things Jack Henry is getting great recognition for right now is all these innovative solutions that were rolling out. We've been spending a lot on new development, new R&D, brand-new products. The Jack Henry Platform is just one of them. And Greg highlighted Banno Business and Financial Crimes Defender. And we have all these new things that we've been rolling out, that's great for the company, that's great for the success or the future success of the company. And it's really created this reputation for Jack Henry as being the innovation leader in our space. The bad news is because of what's happening on the tax side, it's hitting our free cash numbers. And so we have concerns about free cash, which it's all being driven by the fact that we are leading the industry when it comes to innovating and really delivering great solutions for the to sustain the future growth of this company. John Davis : Okay. No. Thanks. That's helpful. And then Greg, a quick one for you on Payrailz. I heard you earlier say you're kind of on track. It looks like at least for the first two months revenue was a little bit lighter than last year. I think you talked about some implementation delays with partners. So just curious kind of an update there you guys seem really excited about the long term. But how is that going from an integration perspective? Are there still implementation delays? Just any sort of update there would be helpful. Greg Adelson : Yeah. Great question. Yeah. Short answer is, we've worked through the integration delays. So we've been able to get through that component. Some of it is just rebuilding up the pipeline with that group. But the reality is we've gotten through the challenges there. The other thing that's important is that the -- some of the additional synergies that we've been able to build as we build out the product has helped us as well. So we're kind of -- we're working through some of the sales delays with lot more of the operational synergies that we've been able to find on things. So everything -- that's why everything continues to be on track. David Foss : Let's reemphasize JD, the numbers Greg shared in his prepared remarks. So 100 clients live now 50 that are in process of implementation so they're not paying us yet but they're in process and then 20 more new contracts that have just been signed. John Davis : Okay, great. And then Dave, just if I could squeeze in one more quick one just on capital allocation. You paid down a little bit of debt. You bought back a little bit of stock in the quarter. How do you think about debt paydown versus buybacks with the stock here? And then any update on from an M&A perspective whether valuations have rationalized yet? Just any color there would be helpful. David Foss : Yeah. So I'll answer the last part first. Not a lot happening when it comes to M&A in the industry. And I've had some interesting conversations with some investment bankers about what they're seeing as far as opportunities in that space. Just nothing really intriguing, right now when it comes to M&A. So that leaves share buyback debt paydown. Of course, we're committed to our dividend policy. And so, the other two topics balancing share buyback with debt paydown, that is definitely going to be a topic at our Board meeting on Monday. Because in this time that needs to be something that we analyze fully. So we're very focused on those two topics and trying to prioritize appropriately. But that will require Board discussion. John Davis : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Dominick Gabriele : Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Dave, should the move to sell products outside the core that you mentioned indicate that you have found a way to stop competitors' sales dynamics of core upgrades? I mean, I think on one of the previous calls you mentioned that your products are so good that the competing sales force would basically say \"Keep our core just upgrade with Jack Henry.\" Is this an indication that you've found a way to stop some of that? And I just have a follow-up. Thanks so much. David Foss : Yes, you are characterizing my previous comments correctly Dominick. That's exactly what I said. It was a shocker to us. And so we stepped back and made sure that we didn't kind of mess ourselves up in this process. But the answer is yes, we're very confident that we have by targeting a few specific cores with a few specific messages and an approach that leverages the Jack Henry Platform. So one of the good news one of the good things is and Greg highlighted it in his prepared comments these new solutions we're talking about Banno and Financial Crimes Defender and so on they are living on the Jack Henry Platform today, the platform we've talked about for core modernization, those are already on that platform. And so we've created a strategy that takes advantage of the fact that those are on the platform. We believe it will create an opportunity for us in these targeted cores. And so yes, we believe we have an answer now. And as Greg pointed out, we're talking about beginning of \u2013 or next summer that we'll really be active in sales. Do you want to add something to that? Greg Adelson : Yes, just two things to add. So one, the other component of this is our ability to bundle. We found some pretty good bundles that we think we can sell into that. So we think that will also help with the success rate and using what Dave said kind of leveraging the technology platform and some of the modules that we have coming out. The other part is the integration work that it does take. So it does take some while to get some of that integration work done before you can actually go out and close a deal. So we're working on all that in the background as well. Dominick Gabriele : Great. Thank you so much for the color. And I guess now that we have a modest deconversion expectation going forward and the way you've structured your guidance, the ROIC of the quarter was 20%. I was wondering if \u2013 and I know you don't set a target for this. But do you believe that the company has kind of hit the floor ROIC level now? And maybe you could help provide some dynamics of why that might move around given some of the investments you're making. Thanks so much. Mimi Carsley : Sure, Dom. So first let me say that I think 20% ROIC is quite attractive and would be the envy of a lot of companies. So it's a commitment to us. We believe that our thoughtful and conservative approach both from a fortress balance sheet, how we think about capital allocation has led to attractive ROICs historically. And it's something that we know as a metric we're following. We know you're following it quite closely from a sustainability of that shareholder value creation. I would say there's a little bit of a math challenge just from the metric itself. So because our net income is growing and because right now we are focused on debt paydown, we did some share repurchase our 35 years of \u2013 fiscal years of dividend growth, those take cash. So while the net income increases the shareholder equity therefore, it reduces. Unless we continue to grow that dividend and do large buybacks or debt paydown by their nature mathematically that ROIC is going to dip a touch. And so I think it's just more of the hangover effect from the debt we had from the Payrailz acquisition. And as we pay down that debt as we do more share repurchases and return that net income back to investors, you'll see that rebound number. So it's just for the trailing 12-month impact of that and the growing net income into equity that has that impact on that. Dominick Gabriele : That's super helpful. And 20% is very attractive. Thanks so much for the help. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead. Dave Koning : Yes, hey, guys. Thanks so much. Nice job. I guess you've mentioned a bunch of stuff on Payrailz already but just a couple just questions around there. How fast year-over-year is that just growing just as a standalone entity? And then it looks like you lost a couple million in the quarter, which is pretty similar I think from a pace standpoint as what you've been losing recently. Is that getting better? And then it looked like you changed the revenue guidance just a touch not much. But just kind of all of those things it seems a few moving parts there right now. Mimi Carsley : Good morning, Dave. Let me start by taking it and then I'll let Greg add in from a strategic perspective. I would say the acquisition remains on track. As Greg mentioned, we feel confident in our ability to hit the previous guidance. Revenue is growing at a nice clip. So I would say the visibility, because you're only looking at two months if not, I wouldn't annualize that to take it more of a trend than it is. So we still feel very confident in terms of that growth and the journey to profitability. Greg Adelson : Yeah. And I would say as I mentioned earlier, we've kind of unhitched some of the barriers that we've had where a lot of the Payrailz solutions in the past were sold through resellers. So now that we brought in and have a lot of our direct sales folks focus on that and working through the issues that we have with the resellers, we feel very strongly that we're back on track. And the technology itself again is even stronger than we anticipated as we've gotten in and have been able to work through some of the challenges there. Dave Koning : Okay. Got you. Thank you. And then the one other thing just between the GAAP operating income guidance and GAAP EPS, the two items would be interest income it seems like you're almost guiding for that to be net zero. And then tax rate would be the other. Is that like 24.5% just those two numbers to get us to GAAP EPS? Mimi Carsley : Yeah, Dave, I would say continue to use 24% from a tax rate. At this point it's too early in the year to see anything materially changing off of that. So I would still recommend using the 24%. The one positive from higher interest rates is you're starting to see a little bit of interest income as well as it helps as an offset to interest expense. And I would just say those are probably -- share count a little bit we did some buyback in Q1. But I would look at the totality of that. But most of the change in EPS is really coming from the operational impact the flow-through from revenue growth. I would highlight just that last year as a reminder the gains last year from the asset sale and the impact from VEDIP this year. Dave Koning : Got you. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Cris Kennedy with William Blair. Please go ahead. Cris Kennedy : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. David, you talked about innovation. Can you just talk about how the module progression for origin or the Jack Henry Platform is going? David Foss : Actually I'll defer to Greg for that one. He's more in the day-to-day with the team on what we're doing there. So go ahead Greg. Greg Adelson : Yeah, sure. And as I mentioned we have a couple of modules that are out in beta right now. So we're tracking exactly to the time frames that we have. We do have a public road map that we share with our customers. We do not share it outside of our customer base. But we have a road map. We're executing actually to the T of that particular road map. And as I mentioned earlier we're going to be pretty excited to be able to share where some of those modules are in their evolution and other modules that we've created back to a full monetization strategy that we have going for the rest of this year and into next. David Foss : And Greg is going to give you that detail Cris on the February call. Greg Adelson : Correct. Cris Kennedy : Okay, looking forward to that. And then just a quick update Banno for business, is that attracting customers that are outside of your core base? Thank you. David Foss : Yeah. So we're not selling outside the core base yet as I mentioned earlier. But it definitely has got attention from people outside the core base. And we're lapping because it's one of those, you want to go and sell it right away but you've got to make sure that everything is lined up and ready to be effective. And it's part of a larger strategy than simply selling Banno business outside the base. So yes we definitely are getting attention. We definitely are preparing to get sales out there actively selling outside the base. But it's part of that broader strategy that we talked about earlier because it goes with retail Banno as well. Greg Adelson : And a lot of that sales will not happen until next fiscal year. David Foss : Yeah. Cris Kennedy : Understood. Thanks for taking the questions. David Foss : Sure. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette : Great. Thank you so much. I know we talked a little bit about Payrailz and implementation, et cetera. But can you help us think about the time to revenue and how that scales? Like when does -- when do we start to see contribution from implementations? And then how long does it take to get that fully implemented and scaled within the P&L? Greg Adelson : Yeah. Well as far as implementations, I mean typically as we have with any of those type of bill pay and payment-providing products it really is somewhat dependent on the customer. We can actually install within 90 days typically. So some of it is dependent on the customer. Some of it is dependent on a core deal where an actual Payrailz may be part of that core deal so they're waiting to implement that. So some of those contracts could have longer tail before they're actually implemented. But as I mentioned earlier with the 100 that are actually on the platform now the 50 that we have in the implementation queue and the 20 that were just sold we have the ability to start moving the needle. As I mentioned earlier we are on track for the guidance that we gave in August for the revenue numbers which is again I think a substantial amount of drive. But again even those percentages obviously we started with a small number. So we're driving the ability to get the technology in place to get all the things that we wanted to do from a tech modernization strategy and driving that as part of -- while we're waiting for some of these contracts to go. But the technology itself is going to drive the longer-term part of this strategy not just the immediate parts that we're doing with the current Payrailz offering. Mimi Carsley : And let me just layer on there. James, good morning. Just as a reminder the payment sector which is 36% roughly of our total revenue of that bill pay let's call it about 15%. So this is really a reinvigoration of that iPay business that was pretty mature. And as so we won't be able to see Payrailz in and of itself but that together that combined business plus the added innovation of new features that neither existing platform has on their own you'll start to see over the upcoming quarters a reinvigoration that will help that total segment. James Faucette : Got it. Got it. Appreciate that. And then I want to ask on the competitive landscape. One of your competitors in at least an adjacent market announced a new product initiative targeting banks and credit unions that enables them to have more of a lightweight core for digital deposit products. And I think they're trying to go at it with a low price point. I know you don't compete on price. But just curious how you're thinking about the competitive environment generally for Banno especially as you kind of work to get that into the installed base and think about opportunities outside the installed base. David Foss : We refer to that as a side core. We've been doing that for years. So that's not a requirement of the digital banking application necessarily it's a requirement of having core functionality where you can actually process those accounts. We've been doing that for a long time. Certainly, we have that integrated with our Banno solution. But the nice thing about our offering is that if the customer simply wants to do it for deposit gathering we can do that. If they want to host a complete digital bank as they continue to grow it's the same platform it's the exact same solution. We can offer loans and GL and everything else through that offering. So that's not something new to Jack Henry. We've been doing that for quite some time. James Faucette : Appreciate that Dave. Thanks. James Faucette : Sure. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vance Sherard for any closing remarks. Vance Sherard : Thank you, MJ. As Dave mentioned next week on Tuesday the 14th, we hope you will join us either in person or virtually as we host our Annual Shareholder Meeting. Additionally we look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming investor events during November and December. In conclusion, we thank all Jack Henry associates whose efforts produce these strong financial results. Thank you for joining us today. And MJ will you please provide the replay number? Operator : Of course. Thank you, Vance. The replay number for today's call is 877-344-7529 and the access code is 2951710. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Jack Henry Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vance Sherard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Vance Sherard : Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today is David Foss, Board Chair and CEO; and Mimi Carsley, CFO and Treasurer; and Greg Adelson, President and COO. After my opening remarks, I will turn the call over to Dave for his comments on our business and industry outlook. After Dave concludes his comments, Greg will discuss his transition to CEO, provide commentary on our operations, including updates on our technology modernization strategy and other key initiatives at Jack Henry. Mimi will then provide commentary around the financial results and updated guidance included in the press release issued yesterday that is available from the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website. We will then open the lines for Q&A. As a reminder, this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to multiple factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to multiple risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures are in yesterday's press release. I will now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Vance. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for the quarter. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, total revenue increased by 8% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Operating income increased 11% for the quarter and increased 14% on a non-GAAP basis. Turning to the segments. We again had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue was up by 8% for the quarter on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment also performed well, posting a 6% increase in revenue this quarter on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We had another strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with a 7% increase in revenue this quarter and a 9% increase on a non-GAAP basis. As I mentioned in the press release, our sales teams again had an outstanding quarter with a number of notable wins. In fact, this was the best second quarter ever for sales bookings and second highest sales quarter in our history, trailing only our June quarter last year. In the second quarter, we inked 14 competitive core takeaways with four of them being multibillion-dollar institutions. Additionally, we signed 12 deals to move existing in-house core clients to our private cloud environment. We continue to see success with our card processing solutions, signing 12 new card processing clients this quarter. We also continue to see strong success signing clients to our Banno digital suite with 135 new contracts in Q2, including 56 contracts for our new Banno business offering. We also surpassed 11 million registered users on the Banno platform, which is a 25% increase over a year ago. I mentioned last quarter that our sales pipeline was at the highest level ever. It's logical to assume that it would be depleted after such a strong sales quarter in Q2. And However, we continue to add to our pipeline, and we ended the quarter on par with Q1, which projects very well for us for the remainder of the sales year. In late January, Cornerstone Advisors published the results of its annual survey of bank and credit union executives. According to that study, nearly 65% of banks and 75% of credit unions expect to increase their technology spending in 2024. This correlates with information we've seen from other sources, including bank director's technology survey last fall, in which a large majority of survey respondents said their bank's technology budget increased over the past year at a median rate of 10%. We are in the midst of conducting our annual Jack Henry strategic benchmark study and we'll share those results on our earnings call in May. We were pleased to have recently received two national workplace awards Newsweek's greatest Workplaces for Diversity and Computer World's Best Places to Work in IT. We also were named as one of America's most responsible companies by Newsweek for our corporate sustainability efforts. We are very proud of that recognition because we view corporate sustainability as a strategic investment for our stakeholders. I encourage you to read our 2024 sustainability report which will be published on March 29 on the Investor page at jackhenry.com. As you all know by now, a couple of weeks ago, I will retire from my current role on June 30 of this year. Greg Adelson will become CEO and President beginning July 1, and I will serve as Executive Board Chair effective on that same day. This transition plan has been carefully considered for some time and we are fortunate to have someone like Greg ready to step into the CEO role. As I said in the press release, it has been my immense pleasure to serve as CEO of this wonderful company for so many years. When I came into this role almost eight years ago, I had a number of large projects I wanted to address, and I'm happy that all of them have now been completed or are well on their way. I'm confident that Greg and the outstanding team we have in place today can continue our trajectory of strong growth, and I'm looking forward to working with them in my new role as Executive Board Chair. Of course, I'll be on the May earnings call, and I have a number of investor meetings scheduled between now and the end of our fiscal year. So, I look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming months. As we focus on the second half of this fiscal year, our sales pipeline is very robust, and we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our clients, our ability to expand client relationships, the spending environment and our long-term prospects for success. With that, I'll turn it over to Greg for an operational update. Greg Adelson : Thank you, Dave. I'm honored and humbled to become the next CEO of this great company in July. I do want to take a moment to acknowledge the outstanding job that Dave has done as CEO the past eight years. Since Dave became CEO at the start of fiscal year 2017, and Jack Henry has experienced outstanding growth with revenue and net income both up approximately 50%. In addition to driving organic growth, Dave has led 26 acquisitions during his 25 years with the company. The legacy Dave is leaving will be remembered for many years to come. On a personal level, I want to thank Dave for his mentorship and guidance for the past 13 years. He has prepared me well for this role, and I will continue to lead this company with an unwavering focus on our employees, clients and shareholders. As the next CEO, I will continue the strategic journey that we are on today and we'll execute our strategic priorities, which include continuing to enhance our exceptional culture continuing to advance our tradition of customer service excellence, cultivate a one Jack Henry mindset in all we do, drive technology innovation and execution at the speed and scale foster an open ecosystem, evaluate strategic acquisitions that will provide additional value to our clients and shareholders. Jack Henry has maintained a philosophy for over 47 years that starts with treating our associates as our first priority. Happy associates are more invested in ensuring we have happy clients and happy clients ensure we reward our shareholders. In short, you can expect continued focus on growing our company and delivering outstanding value to all of our stakeholders. Dave and I will continue to work closely to ensure a smooth transition in July, and I look forward to collaborating with him in his new role as Executive Board Chair. I'm also excited about continuing to work with the other great leaders at Jack Henry and specifically more closely with Mimi and Vance. Mimi has done an outstanding job since becoming CFO in September of 2022, and Vance provides tremendous perspective for all things Jack Henry. Before I speak to our operational performance, I want to go back to Dave's comments regarding our continued strong sales performance. Dave shared our strong success in winning competitive core takeaways as well as our robust sales pipeline. Additionally, we are beginning to see an increase in what has been historic low merger activity among our financial institutions, specifically with our core clients as the acquirers. Due to this increased demand, we are currently adding resources to both our banking and credit union core conversion teams. On the November earnings call, I promised an update on our technology modernization strategy. As a reminder, this strategy is changing how we deliver our solutions through a cloud-native API-first environment, utilizing several key benefits embedded in the Google Cloud platform, including cutting-edge security and business continuity advancements. The premise of this strategy is rebuilding traditional core and noncore functions into a flexible, cloud-native portfolio of services and solutions. Each component will integrate with other Jack Henry solutions and also with third-party fintech\u2019s via the Jack Henry platform. Our clients will be able to access everything they need to run their financial institution in a single platform with all the advantages that the cloud offers, including extremely high system availability, real-time processing, streamlined operations, rapid update, deployment, modern security standards and extensive scalability. As we have indicated previously, our approach to technology modernization has created more pipeline activity in the larger community bank segment as well as a couple of introductory calls with regional institutions. Another benefit we will realize over time is the shared services model that is at the forefront of our technology modernization strategy. Features or solutions that were once built several times throughout the organization are now developed once and use in multiple solutions. Our ability to develop and deliver more rapidly to our clients is an important benefit that will reduce development costs for each new or enhanced solution. The technology will allow us to share the same services with outside partners and competitors to create a better overall experience for all community and regional financial institutions. At Jack Henry, we are focused on execution and doing what we say we're going to do. So, everything I'm about to discuss is share with our clients through six-month road map visibility. Road maps are updated for all products, including the technology modernization strategy and published every February and August for our clients to view. We hold our teams accountable for road map execution as well. As a reminder, our technology modernization strategy already includes recently launched cloud-native solutions like PayCenter, Banno Business and Financial Crimes Defender. We now have over 250 clients using the real-time payments network and almost 150 using FedNow in our pay center application. For additional context, Jack Henry has approximately 60% of the live real-time payment clients and 35% of the live FedNow clients. We recently announced general availability for Banno business and continue to add both banking and credit union clients. We now have more than 90 clients live and over 70 clients in various stages of implementation. Financial Crimes Defender is also generally available, and we have seven clients live in more than 150 in the implementation queue. One new offering we haven't spoken about yet is our open banking solution that provides turnkey API access to the largest integrated banking data aggregators across the industry is an immediate answer to the industry and regulatory pressure to remove screen scraping and share credentials. By creating direct API connections with clients, Jack Henry is making it easier for consumers to connect financial accounts securely and reliably without the need to share user names and passwords. This offering is generally available today and has received a great deal of interest from both Jack Henry core and noncore clients. I also want to update you on some of the key functions we are building on the Jack Henry platform that are already in beta or planned to go in beta in calendar year 2024. I'll start with the incoming and outgoing wires, which we have talked about on previous calls. We plan to be generally available with our domestic wire solution over the next few months and move into beta with international wires by the end of this fiscal year. We are building a general ledger component that will support the common base functions of a financial institution's back office and enable deeper insights on transactions and advanced fraud detection. We plan to be in beta by the end of the calendar year. A key advantage of the Jack Henry platform is our clients being able to easily access their data. Our new data broker solution, which is currently in beta, will enable clients to access all of their Jack Henry data in a single repository with innovative AI intelligence capabilities. To complement the data broker solution, we are creating an executive dashboard with real-time event monitoring to help our C-suite clients make informed dynamic decisions throughout the day based on metrics they customize and update. I will now provide some context to the pricing philosophy will be used to deploy these components. Our go-to-market strategy centers around bundling key components that complement each other and provide enhanced financial and operational benefits like time to deploy new feature enhancements, enhanced security, improved uptime, et cetera. For example, a bundle may include wires, general ledger and data broker. Our pricing model strategy will incorporate elements from our industry-accepted pricing models such as license and/or per seat fees, consumption-based and per account pricing. We will encourage engagement with any combination of our solutions and further reward those who consume more components. Ultimately, the value proposition becomes evident as clients recognize the benefits of additional modules as well as the compelling features of the Google Cloud Platform. One last topic from our November call is our plan to offer several key solutions outside of the Jack Henry core base by the end of calendar year 2024. We remain on track to begin selling Banno Business, Financial Crimes Defender, various payment solutions and available components from the Jack Henry platform in our fiscal year '25 sales year. We have targeted several competing cores that we believe bring the best mutual value and have a need for premier digital fraud and real-time payment solutions. I will continue to keep you updated on this strategy. In closing, I am passionate about accomplishing our strategic priorities and moving our company forward through innovation and execution. I am grateful for the opportunity to lead this finest group of talented and dedicated professionals in the industry. I want to thank all of them for their tireless effort and commitment. I will now turn things over to Mimi for some detail on the numbers. Mimi Carsley : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Our continued focus on serving our community and regional financial institution clients, investing in our joint future and delivering shareholder value led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. I'll begin with the details driving our as expected strong second quarter and year-to-date results, then conclude with our full-year guidance update. Second quarter GAAP and non-GAAP revenue increased 8%, a continuation of the strong start to our year and keeping us on track for a tremendous fiscal 2024 as year-to-date growth was 8% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Deconversion revenue of $4.9 million, which we pre-released last week, was down approximately $1.5 million, reflecting minimal financial institution consolidation. Year-to-date, deconversion revenue is $9 million, $1.9 million less than the prior period. As a reminder, effective September 1 onward, Payroll's results are included in both GAAP and non-GAAP figures. Now let's look more closely the details. Cap services and support revenue increased a healthy 7%, while non-GAAP increased a more robust 8%. The first half increased 7% for GAAP and 8% for non-GAAP basis. Services and support growth during the quarter was the result of increases in data processing and hosting and the timing of user group revenues. We continue to experience robust growth in our private and public cloud offerings which again increased 10% in the quarter and for year-to-date. This reoccurring revenue contributor has long been a double-digit growth engine. Shifting to processing revenue. We saw consistently positive performance with 9% growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and first half from this reoccurring revenue source. Similar to recent results, drivers included a combination of higher card and other payment processing with strong digital demand. Next, moving to expenses. Beginning with cost of revenue, which increased 5% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis during the quarter, 7% for GAAP versus 6% non-GAAP year-to-date. Drivers for the quarter included higher direct costs consistent with increases in related revenue and internal license and fees. Growth in cost of revenue was limited to 5% due to active cost control and the timing of merit increases. Next, R&D expense decreased 3% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter. The decrease was due to lower personnel expense, net of capitalization and inclusive of benefits. For the first half, R&D expense increased 4% on a GAAP basis and 3% for non-GAAP. And lastly, on a GAAP basis, SG&A rose 24% for the quarter, 21% on a non-GAAP basis, primarily due to the shift in our customer conference from Q1 to Q2 and was higher personnel and related costs. Year-to-date, SG&A expense increased 31% on a GAAP basis and 9% non-GAAP. The primary difference is the $16.4 million in one-time costs related to the voluntary early departure incentive program need in Q1. We remain focused on generating compounding margin expansion and the quarter delivered 111 basis points in non-GAAP margin at 21.3%. Non-GAAP margin benefited from operational performance, and a one-time shift in our merit increases from Q2 to Q3, offset slightly by the timing of our customer conference. These strong quarterly results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.26 and up 14%. Breaking down the results into the three operating segments, we're pleased by the consistent solid performance achieved. Our core segment revenue increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis, with non-GAAP operating margins increasing 166 basis points, benefiting from private cloud trends and strong cost controls. Year-to-date, non-GAAP revenue growth was 8% and the associated margin increased 80 basis points. Payments segment revenue increased 6% on a non-GAAP basis. This segment had impressive non-GAAP operating margin growth of 128 basis points. This was due to the strong growth in our EPS business, moderate card growth coupled with our scalable operating model and disciplined cost control. Year-to-date, non-GAAP revenue growth matched the quarter at 6% with 94 basis points of margin expansion. It should be noted that card revenue growth has been negatively impacted by lower card production among other non-processing revenue items. Excluding these impacts, processing-related revenue increased 8% for the quarter and 9% year-to-date. Finally, complementary segment non-GAAP revenue increased 9% with flat margin. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue also increased 9% with 25 basis points of margin expansion. Growth year-to-date was driven primarily by digital, recently released solutions and overall product mix. Quarterly margins faced headwinds from direct support costs, amortization of new products and licenses and fees. Now let's turn to a review of cash flow and capital allocation. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $239 million, a $48 million increase over the prior period, producing free cash flow of $129 million, slightly more than the $119 million last year. Excluding asset sale impacts of $1 million and $28 million from the current year-to-date and prior period, respectively, free cash flow was $37 million higher through the first half of our current fiscal year. Additionally, the timing of tax payments this year represented a $15 million headwind to free cash flow. Our consistent dedication to value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 20%. Additionally, I would highlight other notable return of capital metrics for the first half of our fiscal year, including $20 million in share repurchases offsetting annual dilution, $20 million in debt reduction and $76 million in dividends. As we head into the second half of fiscal 2024, I will conclude with guidance highlights. As you are aware, yesterday's press release included updated fiscal 2021 full-year GAAP guidance along with a reconciliation to non-GAAP guidance metrics. As a reminder, we filed an 8-K on August 3. It describes how starting in the current fiscal year, we are using a revised approach for deconversion revenue, guidance. Based on current trends, we expect to see similar acquisition levels of our core customers for the second half of the fiscal year. As such, we're reiterating our full-year deconversion revenue guidance of $16 million. Based on positive year-to-date results from strong execution and near-term visibility, we are tightening our revenue growth outlook around the current midpoint. We now expect to generate full-year non-GAAP revenue growth of 7.4% to 8.0% compared to the 7.2% to 8.2% provided on the November call. This corresponds to an increased full-year GAAP revenue guidance of 6.6% to 7.2% for fiscal '24. In tandem with our revenue outlook, we now expect an increase in annual non-GAAP margin expansion of 35 basis points to 40 basis points compared to the 30 basis points to 35 basis points previously provided. The full year tax rate is now approximately 23.5% with potential bias slightly higher. Incorporating the noted positive updates Full year guidance for GAAP EPS is revised upwards to $5.09 to $5.13 per share from previous guidance of $4.98 to $5.04 per share. As a reminder, the guidance for deconversion revenue compared to actual fiscal 2023 deconversion revenue, VIP severance-related costs, and nonrecurring gain on asset sales resulted in an approximate $0.37 headwind for fiscal 2024 GAAP EPS. Lastly, some additional modeling commentary. We are comfortable with the current level of huge consensus for revenue growth, operating margin and GAAP EPS. Our full year guidance of 60% free cash flow conversion is reiterated. However, the legislation that passed the house last week would have a material beneficial impact on fiscal 2024 free cash flow and beyond. We are monitoring legislative progress and are hopeful for a swift and positive outcome. Based on the current bill language, it past our free cash flow conversion would rebound to historical normal levels either in fiscal '24 or fiscal year '25, depending on the timing of certain items. In conclusion, Q2 reflects the strong performance we've seen consistently in the first half and expect the remainder of our fiscal year. We are exceptionally positive about our ability to deliver innovative and in-demand solutions, the resilience of our clients and our focus on execution and shareholder value creation. We appreciate all the contributions of our hardworking and dedicated associates that drove these strong results. We thank all Jack Henry investors for their continued confidence. Laura, will you please open the call for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from John Davis of Raymond James. Please go ahead. John Davis : Maybe just wanted to follow up on the free cash flow comments that you just made. Getting back to historical levels, I'm assuming you mean kind of right around 100%. So that would imply kind of 40 points of headwinds that will get reversed. I thought before it was maybe 25 points or 30 points. So just, a, I just want to make sure when you say historical levels, you're talking in and around 100%. And is it kind of 40 points of headwind this year? Mimi Carsley : Great question. I think premature to see the timing and the impact as to when to whether that hits 2024 or 2025. that I would say certainly, our historical norm range of 80% to 100% is where we believe we would revert back to. It just depends on the timing. John Davis : Okay. No, that's helpful. And then just on second half margins, I think the guide implies margins will be down year-over-year after being up over 100% in the first half of the year. So maybe just talk a little bit about some of the headwinds that you do face kind of in the back half of fiscal '24. Mimi Carsley : Yes. So, we manage the business on a full year basis, JD. And so, as we think about it, we're pleased to have the additional margin expansion in the guide that we provided yesterday and today. Just in terms of the actual timing and seasonality of it, it just depends on when certain events like personnel-related costs, licensing costs in any particular quarter from a climb over perspective. As you know, our first quarter is usually the highest margin of our year. And then typically, the endpoints are less or so. So, I wouldn't say read anything more into the seasonality, and we're just basing it on a full year guide. John Davis : Okay. Great. And then, Dave, one for you, but also congrats on your retirement, your move to Executive Chair. And Greg, congrats on the CEO role. But Dave, you talked a lot about the competitive environment being fairly favorable. We continue to break records on the sales front, pipeline is robust. Maybe you can talk a little bit about what specific products or is there a segment of the market that you're having outside of success the top line results and the sales have been very, very good over the last 12 months. And just maybe a little bit more color on what exactly is driving that. David Foss : Sure. Thanks, JD. So, as I've said previously, it's amazing. We're 47 years into our run as a core provider and yet core continues to be a really strong driver. I just quoted to you 14 wins in the quarter. four of them, multibillion-dollar banks. That definitely leads the industry by far as compared to anybody else in the industry. So, core is still a key driver for us. But then oftentimes tied to the core, but sometimes not, and we have these other best-of-breed solutions, and we talked about many of them on the call before Banno. The retail Banno solution has been a key driver for us. Well, now we have Banno business in the equation. And you heard me quote the 56 contracts that were just signed in this quarter for Banno business, there is a real demand for a solution like that modern digital brand-new digital banking solution like that for small and leading business clients. I've talked in the past about our treasury solution. Again, a modern digital treasury solution for large commercial clients. So of course, it's not the bank that uses that. They're a large commercial customer that uses that hasn't been a brand-new ground-up treasury solution and certainly no digital-first treasury solution written in many, many years. So that continues to be a driver for us. Fraud, Financial Crimes Defender, Greg just quoted the numbers to you as far as Financial Crimes Defender. We have seven live, but we have a whole bunch of them now in the backlog because it's a brand-new ground-up developed fraud solution to deal with fraud in today's environment. And so, it's many of those things. And the thing -- the correlation, I think you need to make is every one of those that I just talked about has been written brand new in the last two years, five years by Jack Henry. So, these are not things that we acquired that we had to try and figure out how to make them modern. These are things that Jack Henry has innovated we paid a lot to do the development work. But when you get done with that, you have something that is a best-of-breed solution centered around digital, many of them centered around a public cloud, and there is a huge demand today for those types of offerings. And so, I don't see this slowing down at all. We're really well positioned today, and we're continuing to innovate as a key technology provider in our space. Operator : And the next question will come from Nik Cremo of UBS. Nik Cremo : Thank you for taking my question. Congrats, Greg and Dave. First, I just wanted to follow up on the Payment segment. When can this segment get back into the 8% to 9% growth range? I know there was a few puts and takes called out, which is lower card production, but we also have Payrailz, which supposed to double this year. I'm not sure if that is still on the table, but just be curious to hear your thoughts there. Mimi Carsley : Thanks, Nick, for the question. So, I would really point to you on the card within card within payments, the processing related. So that's the reoccurring nature of within that segment, and that grew strongly at 8%. And so that is an indicator of the overall success of that segment and our ability to get back to what we view from the growth algorithm, the prospects for that segment. So, I would say some of the non-processing related, the pass-through of the card production is more temporary and expect that the processing engine will continue to drive the strong growth Nik Cremo : Thank you. And then for my follow-up, maybe a more medium-term question, but you just discussed the opportunity you see for generative AI on the revenue side, but also, more importantly, on the cost side, just relating to any of the benefits that you could see from increased software engineer productivity with these AI tools and call center automation. David Foss : So, do you want me to start with that one or do you want to? So, I'll start and then Greg will chime in here because this has been a -- as I'm sure you can imagine, a big topic of conversation for months around Jack Henry and lots of opportunities for us -- so on the per site. So. One thing I should be clear about. So traditional AI, it's a machine learning and robotic cross automation, Jack Henry has been in that business for years. So traditionally, we've been doing that for a long time. Generative AI, which is specific to your question, Nick, lots of opportunities there on the development side. The trick on the development side is our primary value is through our IP, right, our intellectual property. And so, when you're using generative AI to write code, you have to be really, really careful that nothing that you're doing becomes part of the public domain. And so, we're being very careful about what are we doing and how are we doing it, but we are active today with our development teams using generative AI, you pointed out customer service offering. So that is an area that we're focused on internally, and I'll let Greg touch on that. But we also rolled out at our client conference in October, a generative AI offering for our customers to serve their customers and that was well received at our client conference here in the fall. And then if you think about all the processes that we do within Jack Henry that have are not customer service and are not software development, just automating things we do within the company is another big area of focus.  And I'll let Greg add his thoughts. Greg Adelson : Yes. No, I think -- I mean, I think the other thing I would add is that we're also making sure we have strong governance around what we do. And so, we're taking a lot of time to make sure that we're evaluating. We're partnering with Google and a couple of other folks that we have some solutions with to kind of test some models. We're using opportunities here, not only in the contact center, as David mentioned, but also in a couple of other products. I did mention the AI assist kind of module that we would use in some of our data analysis that we call executive dashboard for the C-suite folks. And so, there are several opportunities that we're still evaluating. But again, we want to make sure that we get this right and that we're building it with the right guardrails and things along that line. But you'll continue to hear more about where we're going with that in the coming months. Operator : Our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jason Kupferberg : I wanted to come back to some of the pipeline comments, certainly seems encouraging that you've got some real solid stability in the pipeline despite having a really strong quarter of bookings. So, can you talk about how the composition of the pipeline has changed in recent quarters in terms of, say, customer size, product mix and if there's any numbers you want to share around that, just in terms of helping us understand the composition of the pipeline, that would be great. David Foss : Sure, Jason. I wouldn't say that there's a significant notable change in the composition of the pipeline. It's -- we have a number of core deals. So again, we just signed 14 -- or announced 14 deals here. That is not slowing down. I would say that the size of those core opportunities, meaning the size of the institution, has gone up and is continuing to go up. So, we're being recognized among the larger community and regional bank space as being a real player. And so, I think the overall size of the institutions bank and credit union has gone up. But then if you look at the rest of the mix, most of it are the things that I highlighted when I was kind of going through with JD, the hot topics today, what's driving that success. It's this all this brand-new technology that we have -- that we're offering today. So, two years ago, almost nothing of those except Banno was on the list. But now all these things have been rolled out in the last couple of years, and they are dominating the sales process today because they're brand-new technology, people have been hungry for these things, a Banno fraud solution that uses AI, I mean everybody is dying for that type of technology. And so here we are, we've just gone live with Financial Crimes Defender. And so much of it is because of these brand-new things that have been rolled out in the last year or two or three that's what's dominating a lot of the sales conversations today, and that's what's driving a lot of the strength in the pipeline because you look at what's happening with our competitors in the space, there's really nothing innovative that's been coming out in the last couple of years. And here, Jack Henry has a long list of brand-new innovative solutions. Jason Kupferberg : And then on competitive landscape in core, are you guys seeing a broader range of competitors as you continue to move a little bit further up market? Maybe others are trying to move a little bit more down market? Just how are competitive dynamics in core evolving? David Foss : Yes, I'd say no change at all. There's we compete against the traditional players. We've competed against the traditional players forever. There have been upstarts, trying to either come into the U.S. internationally or start from scratch, and none of those are really even showing up in RFPs with the exception of once or twice a year. So, I wouldn't say there's any change of any kind on the core side as far as the competitive landscape. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Just a housekeeping one for Mimi on free cash flow. I know you're maintaining the guide. I'm assuming no changes in legislation. But fair to say that Q3 would be fairly subdued and then followed by a stronger Q4 just based on typical seasonality. Mimi Carsley : Yes, I think that's fair to say. And I think if anything, we're reiterating the guide, but there's probably a little bit of upside there, even without legislative change. Operator : And next, we have a question from David Togut of Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning, and congratulations to you both, Dave and Greg. Dave, I know when you initially became CEO eight years ago, one of your major priorities was the card migration platform, moving your kind of back-office processing of debit cards over to the back office of what was then First Data now Fiserv First Data and then obviously, adding the capability to do credit card processing on top of that. Where do we stand overall in this initiative in terms of the cost savings that's delivered to Jack Henry? And then where are you in terms of the uptake of the credit card processing offering? David Foss : Yes. So, I'll start, but I'll ask Greg is a lot closer to the details as far as where we are today. So, from my perspective, this has been a wildly successful initiative for Jack Henry. And at the time, I've been in this business a long time. And the idea of bringing three companies together to deliver a solution that's going to replace two different platforms all to one platform was a very, very big daunting project. But now looking back on it, it's been incredibly successful for our company as far as hitting the targets that we expected to hit financially for Jack Henry as far as the sales opportunities that it's created, which have been very significant over the past few years. So, I look back on that project as a really significant success. Now the thing I will emphasize before I ask Greg to chime in here, I said all along, you are not going to see the credit card side of this business become anywhere close to what the debit cards had side is we were doing. We were focused on the credit card side because we had certain customers who said, we want to process both debit and credit with the same provider, and we want to make sure that we have that option for them. And so, I'll ask Greg just kind of talk about where we are today. Greg Adelson : Yes, specifically on the credit card. So, we -- roughly between full-service card, agent card in-house card. We have roughly over institutions. And so -- and I think part of the challenge is some of the smaller institutions which is why we came out with an agent program was they really didn't want to go in with the full service just based on resources and some of the risk and things like that. So, I think we have done -- the team continues to sell it. We continue to have the number of deals come in just not to the same level as debit continues to grow. But also, we're continuing to add feature functionality to the services. As Dave mentioned, it is a tri-party relationship, and we continue to work with the other two parties to make sure that we stay innovative and ahead of the game. So, the relationship has actually gone well, which has actually contributed to the fact that the growth has been significant as well. So, both from a service side and a transaction processing side. David Togut : And just as a follow-up, Jack Henry outperformed on gross margin versus our model. And I know you initiated a media program a few quarters ago, which Mimi, I think you described. To what extent did VEDIP uptake actually helped gross margin in the quarter? So, like stripping out any onetime charge benefit focusing more on like sustainable reductions in cost of labor. Mimi Carsley : Yes. I wanted to say that it had a significant impact. That was a one-time charge related to kind of severance and the program. As we said, we didn't do it for kind of in-year savings. This wasn't a sneaky kind of design risk plan. This was a very talent-focused plan to ensure that we had the type of talent for the future needs of the organization. And in fact, the majority of those roles have been backfilled with rising talent in the organization, some at lower levels in the organization as we zero-base budget every position the majority of those roles have been filled. So, I wouldn't say it was a significant reason for the margin expansion or the expense savings this quarter. David Togut : Understood. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Vasu Govil of KBW. Vasu Govil : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I want to add my congratulations to Dave and Greg. My first question is on Banno. It seems to have had an outstanding quarter in a number of new wins. And I caught that Banno business was a contributor there. But even without that, it seems like the number of wins were significantly higher than the quarterly average. Any call-outs on that? And apologies if I missed it, but did you give us the number of customers in millions that you usually give every quarter? David Foss : The number of customers that we signed. Is that what you're asking, Vasu? Vasu Govil : Within Banno, I would just [indiscernible]. David Foss : Yes, 11 million. Yes, we surpassed 11 million at the end of the quarter, so I quoted that 11 million. And so no, there's nothing -- I think part of what happened here is I quoted the number for the Banno business wins. And then beyond Banno business with the regular Banno platform, that number was up. I think the reason for that is because there were people out there waiting for Banno business before they would also sign to go at the regular Banno platform, which includes retail. And so that's the significant point now that Banno business is in market generally available, we had customers who said, \"Okay, I've been holding off because I want to do both at the same time, both Banno business and regular Banno.\" That would be the only callout that I would have as far as the size of the wins. Vasu Govil : And just in terms of relative revenue opportunity, if you're just selling Banno regular versus Banno business? Is it a 2x opportunity? Is it greater on the Banno business side? Greg Adelson : Yes. So, I think one thing that just to make sure that we clarify. So, you have to have Banno Retail to have Banno business. So, one of the things that Dave was just alluding to is that some of the folks who are waiting to get Banno business -- or Banno retail is because they're waiting on Banno business and they wanted them at the same time. You can buy Banno retail without buying Banno business, but you have to have retail to get the business side. So back to the 2x comment, I don't think it's a 2x component. It is an additive component to ensuring that, one, that we get the retail and we continue to add fee structures to that based on how we model that. But I wouldn't call it a 2x. Vasu Govil : Understood. That's helpful. And then a quick one for you, Mimi. I appreciate that the midpoint of the revenue guide didn't change, but it does look like you took off the top end just a little bit. And I know you called out the card production slow down. Was that the bigger driver or any sort of other callouts on how you see that evolving? Mimi Carsley : Good question, Vasu. I think generally, the tightening was more so based on our confidence as we're now halfway through the year with strong results in already banked in the ability to really center around that guide. So, I think it's more that than thinking about the top end coming down, just feeling more and more confident about that midpoint. We still have a second half to do here and a decent amount of growth that we have anticipated in our plans, especially in Q3 and Q4 around processing around card, around our payments business. So too early yet to say it's going to be higher than that, but very confident in our ability to deliver. Operator : The next question is from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Steve, you've commented a lot on core and obviously, Jack Henry is doing well. But as you look at the market, what would you anticipate in terms of a number of core deals? I know when COVID happened, it\u2019s kind of flipped and then we went back to kind of normal. So, as you look at 2024, what would you anticipate the number of deals that might show up in the marketplace? David Foss : Well, it's a pretty predictable number. Every year, it's somewhere around 100 deals in total that happened per year as far as somebody leaving whoever is their current provider and going to a different provider. That's not, hey, I'm staying with my same provider and switching to another system. It is going to a different provider. Normally, about 100 deals a year is a good number to use on average. Kartik Mehta : Perfect. And you've talked about, obviously, the sales pipeline being very strong. I think Greg talked about maybe hiring more people. And as you look at your sales pipeline kind of look out forward, how much confidence can you look at that revenue that's going to come up in terms of the number of quarters you feel good that as that revenue converts that you'll be able to put up kind of this high single-digit revenue growth? David Foss : Yes. On the core side, we have very accurate predictability. We have -- we go through this monthly the chart as far as the core conversions that are slotted, whether it's a new core customer coming in, it's a customer moving from in-house to our private cloud environment. Or if it's a customer who's acquiring another institution, and we're merging them in. We have all those things. We have great dashboard tools that we use at Jack Henry. So, it's very predictable for us. Mimi Carsley : Kartik, if I can add on. The only add-on I would say, is we look at that on an annual basis. So, in any one quarter, depending on prior year, the comp of the size of the organization that was being implemented or migrated versus this year, the size of an organization still feels confident in that number, but it can vary quarter-to-quarter depending on just the roster of slots and the profile of those customers. So that's the only color I would add. Kartik Mehta : Just one last question, maybe for you. You talked a little bit about free cash flow and let's assume that the legislation doesn't pass, but you still seem confident that maybe there's upside to the original guide on free cash flow conversion. And I'm wondering maybe what's behind that or what's changed since the original guide to give you confidence that maybe it will be better. Mimi Carsley : Yes. I think a couple of things that are coming in. One is just the certainty of the results that we have year-to-date. The other is, as we lowered the tax rate as part of the guide, that helps from a cash flow as well. So, there's just a couple of small components as we fine-tune the free cash flow forecast for the remainder of the year that makes me feel comfortable about there being upside there. Operator : The next question comes from Cris Kennedy of William Blair. Cris Kennedy : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Congratulations to Greg and David. Regarding the technology initiatives, is there a way to think about the revenue opportunity associated with that? And if you could maybe frame it against the private cloud transition that you guys have been going through for the last 10 years or so. Greg Adelson : Yes, I think it's -- you have to think about it differently than the private cloud transition because that was truly pulling, as Dave has alluded to many times, pulling a customer out and it was typically a 2x kind of thing. I don't think that when you look at the tech modernization because depending on the number of components that are purchased and really the advent of the timing of some of that, it isn't a take everything we have today and move it over. So, it isn't that same level of, I think, revenue growth. But the part that is exciting for us is the ability to take these components drive again, an additional wedge into the relationship and create that opportunity for larger customers or smaller customers to dip their toe into the public cloud. And as Dave has said many, many times, I mean, there's a lot of our customers that aren't ready to do this. There are some that are already and part of our beta process today. So that's going to be a constant evaluation of the timing of when that big hit comes. But we do know that it's coming based on the feedback that we're getting from some of the larger institutions that we've been speaking to because they're more apt to do this sooner than later. And so just continued growth in that path. But there's still some time to be taken before we can give much certainty or what I would say, certainty on some of the revenue parts of this. David Foss : The other thing I'll add to this, Cris, it's important to keep in mind, there are components that will be offered now. This is not an apples-to-apples comparison of the old core versus new core. The way we used to think of core and now it's just the same thing, it's not a different platform. There are components that we'll be offering with this that nobody has ever offered before. And Greg alluded earlier to Data Broker. That has not been an offering. That has not been a thing as far as the industry is concerned. That's brand-new opportunity, brand-new revenue. It's part of the core offering, if you will, in the future, but there are several other examples like that, that create revenue upside opportunity, but it's not -- you just have to think about it differently than the way we've thought previously about converting a core from one platform to another. Greg Adelson : Yes. And I think 1 thing I do want to add is that we'll get to a point where we talk about platform as really the driver of what sits on that platform. So, data broker or executive dashboard or open banking solutions, other things, like we already mentioned, Defender, Banno, all those components are all going to sit on the platform and will drive additional revenue. Cris Kennedy : Understood. And then just following up on -- in the press release, you talked about 28.5% growth of digital revenue in the first half of the year. Is there a way to think about the contribution from digital within the services and support revenue? Mimi Carsley : Yes. Let me get back with you on that detail. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Schmidt of Citi. Andrew Schmidt : Dave, Greg, Mimi, thanks for having me on the call. So, a quick question on just the core win side of things. You mentioned the funnel, the number of RFPs being relatively consistent. But I'm curious if there's been any changes in win rates just given what you're seeing in the competitive environment? It seems clearly advantageous from a competitive perspective. So, I'm curious if there's any changes on the win rate front. David Foss : Yes, Andrew, I don't think there's anything notable. Again, with only 100 deals happening per year, we're in the 50 to 55 or have been down for a while, 50 to 55. So, we're winning more than half of those opportunities per year. I don't know that there's anything -- getting to 60 is a big deal for us. But from a percentage basis, that doesn't look real huge. So, I don't think I would call out anything as being significant. Our challenge and our job is to make sure we maintain that rate because, as I said before, we are by far leading the industry. And as long as we maintain that rate, that bodes well for us as far as our algorithm -- forward-looking algorithm of revenue growth and so on. So, nothing significantly notable there. Andrew Schmidt : Got it. Makes a ton of sense. And then if you talk about just the views on acceptance of the public cloud, you're hearing that it's slow, but obviously, attitudes are changing towards more comfort with having things like the general ledger in the cloud. Maybe you could just talk through the process that FIs have to work through for themselves to be comfortable with hosting things like general ledger in broader core components in the cloud, that would be great. David Foss : Yes. It's an interesting question, an interesting topic, frankly. I've been doing this for a long time and kind of listening to and talking to all the financial institutions that we talk to, they all want to get there. They're all trying to figure out how do we get there. They just -- many of them are not quite sure how to get there. And with the regulatory environment that we live in, regulators are not saying, \"Hey, we think you should go do this.\" So, there's a lot of walk before you run happening where people -- and that's part of where our Jack Henry platform strategy really, really positions us well because our strategy allows people to do is adopt a modularized approach. I'm going to do wires in the public cloud and kind of see how that goes and make sure I don't have a regulator knock on my door and say, \"What are you guys doing?\" So, they can kind of ease into the public cloud environment. But we have several of our noncore solutions today, fully public cloud. Savanna was there, Financial Crimes Defender, some that we've talked about today. But as far as the core functionality, this whole strategy allows people to walk before they run, and that is appealing to a lot of folks that we're talking to. And so, we think that's going to help with the question that you're asking. Operator : And our next question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Great. Greg and Dave extend my congratulations to both of you. I want to ask just in terms of the implementation resources. I think you've talked about 150-plus clients in implementation for Financial Crimes Defender and another 70 for Banno business. I'm just wondering if there's any benefit or should we think about potentially increasing committee increasing resources to accelerate those implementations a bit? Or do you feel pretty comfortable with the pacing that you've got right now? David Foss : No, that's a great insightful question. So, we do that on a regular basis. So, we meet with the team on a monthly basis based on installation queues. So, we do look at what the time is to do an implementation for a particular product. Can we add resources that will add value in getting those -- that revenue on the -- into the company faster? So, to your point, we do that on a regular basis for all of our products. James Faucette : Got it. Got it. Greg Adelson : Some of it, James, is also tied to just the timing of the -- like Dave just mentioned a lot of sales. So, some of it is the timing of that as well. James Faucette : Okay. Got it. Got it. But for now, we should think about you feeling like that you're in pretty good shape from what you're spending off from an implementation standpoint, et cetera. David Foss : That's correct. James Faucette : Okay. And then just thinking about -- I know this topic that's been talked about for a long time, but any change in the overall environment around M&A? And it seems like there continues to be at least pull down of private valuations, et cetera. But I'm just wondering what you're seeing in that market and if their potential assets that are particularly attractive, especially from a technology perspective. Just taking your temperature on potential for M&A? David Foss : So, you know well, you followed us for a long time, James. You know well, how much we love to love to be involved in deals and we love to do deals. I will just tell you, we don't have a single deal sitting for review right now at Jack Henry. It's there's still a slow, slow time. There are certainly companies out there that we'd be interested in, but not a single deal on the table right now. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Koning of Baird. Dave Koning : Just a couple of quick ones. First of all, EPS guide, at the midpoint, it was raised by about $0.10. And it looks like maybe $0.01 to $0.02 on EBIT is higher, a few cents on tax, but it seems like there's about $0.05 I can't reconcile, where might that be? Mimi Carsley : So, on the EPS, I would say it's about $0.01 or $0.02 for operational. And then the remaining split is about 50-50 is the difference in the tax rate plus interest -- net interest income that we're earning based on higher interest rates. Dave Koning : Got you. I'm sure you know of many banks that will pay good rates. So -- and then I guess, secondly, just on January payments volumes, many kinds of competitors and the industry participants called out the first two or three weeks being pretty slow. It sounds like maybe the back part of January got better, but what have you seen kind of through January and maybe even into early February, just in payments volumes. Mimi Carsley : Yes. I would say, overall, our volume transaction nears Visa and Mastercard domestic, pretty similarly, we did see the same experiences that they have talked about publicly about January weather and who knows right now is all the rains in California of that. But what we saw typically by the end of January with some rebounding from those very temporary lows. Operator : The next question is from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Thanks for everything, Dave, and looking forward to working with you, Greg. I guess we've been talking to investors in your quarter since the management team change announcement. And Greg, talk about what you've learned under Dave and being a part of the Jack Henry team over the years that should give investors\u2019 confidence that the new management team, including Mimi, who's done a great job, obviously, since her start, we'll continue executing with the same consistency in the years to come. Greg Adelson : And I think it just starts with a culture that we've built for 47 years here, and it's a very collaborative approach. We work very tightly together. And between my time with Dave, I've done a lot of -- I was heavily involved in the card work that happened years ago. Obviously, if some of the M&A that we've done in the Payments group when I led the payments group. And just I think from a philosophy standpoint, Dave and I are very much aligned on how we look at things, how we evaluate what we do for our three pillars of success that we always talk about our associates, clients and shareholders. And so, I don't think you're going to see very much change at all. A lot of the same level of consistency on how we think and operate there'll be some nuances and opportunities where some things that I have in my background and what Dave had in his background, so I'm hoping that those will all be things that we can add to. But the reality is that I spent 13 years at this company, and all 13 have been working for Dave directly. So, I would say there's a lot of consistency that you should look forward to. David Foss : Greg is a snappier dresser than I am. Dominick Gabriele : And then if maybe if we could just dive in a little bit deeper on the guidance, I was just looking at the slides from this quarter to last quarter. And it looked like there was a rise in the non-GAAP revenue expectation, but a lowering of the high end of GAAP revenue. I was just curious on what would cause that debt deviation since the deconversion fees are versus stable? Mimi Carsley : So, I just want to make sure I understand your question, Dom. You're saying you're seeing a greater change in non-GAAP? Or you're saying you're seeing a greater change in GAAP? Dominick Gabriele : It looks like from what I saw that the range was a little higher in -- on the growth in non-GAAP revenue, but then you took down the high end of the GAAP revenue, maybe I don't have that right, but I. Mimi Carsley : Yes. Let me look further into it, but I have nothing that comes to mind. It should be more of a flow-through because we're keeping the deconversion guide for the full year at 16%. So, there's not much that's changing there. So, you should see a similar pattern non-GAAP and GAAP. Dominick Gabriele : Excellent. That's what I would have thought. Okay. Perfect. And then maybe just one last one. If you guys could just talk to us about your business investment strategy in terms of expense dollar allocation as you look forward. We've obviously -- at least versus my model, the expenses were much better than what I was expecting for the quarter. And I know there's some seasonality, but talk about the expense investment versus accelerating revenue strategy. Mimi Carsley : So, Dom, I would say a couple of things this quarter and that will also impact the full year and therefore, the guide. 2 things. One is the -- not just the timing of the Connect conference, but the Connect conference was even more successful than last year. So, from a profitability perspective, that helped for margins and expenses being lower. The other is the decision we made around a onetime change in the change in timing of our merit for our associate population. And so that also helps from a straight through to the bottom line from an expense perspective. But as always, and with consistency, we not only zero-based budget, but we look and think about the investments, the amount of spend going to our top projects and top products, the amount from a capitalization in R&D. You saw the consistency of the 14% of R&D spend. So, we're always thinking about how to invest for our future, thinking about what those business plans look like and what that ROI looks like and the bandwidth of the organization. So, I think there'll be more consistency from a spending towards future that you've seen in the past. And I think some of the margin expansion was just due to a heightened focus on cost control, and that some of the changes that we've made from the merit timing. Operator : And next, we have a question from Ben Varga of Autonomous Research. Ben Varga : I just wanted to echo everyone else's congratulations on the leadership transition. My first question is about Banno business. It's great to see the initial client interest, I guess. In terms of the implementations that you have in the Q, how long does it typically take until those opportunities start contributing to revenue? David Foss : Yes, it's really a timing thing based on the client themselves. Honestly, an implementation of Banno business is less than 60 days. So, some of those are tied to core deals. Some of those are tied to other product implementations. So really, it's dependent more on the client than it is on Jack Henry. And kind of back to the question earlier, that James had related to that. So, some of that is really -- we try to push the clients along, but it's not necessarily a Jack Henry lag as it is waiting for the client. So -- but it's 60 days or less if they're ready to go. Ben Varga : Got it. That makes perfect sense. And then as we think about the growth opportunity for Banno Retail, are these wins coming from greenfield opportunities for the most part? Or are you also kind of bumping up against some of the other digital banking providers? David Foss : Yes, absolutely. No. We have a lot of competitive takeaways from the other providers. There are some opportunities within both the core base. We've talked about taking it outside of the Jack Henry core base and where we're going with that. But right now, there's probably an equal mix of opportunities from a handful of the larger digital banking providers today that we're winning some deals from and as well as our existing core base. Greg Adelson : And I think it's fair to say there is no such thing as a greenfield opportunity at any point. So, everybody has something. We're displacing something every single time. David Foss : Yes. That's a fair point. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vance Gerard for any closing remarks. Vance Sherard : Thank you, Laura. We look forward to speaking further with many of you at investor events in the coming weeks. On behalf of the management team, I would like to express our appreciation to all the Jack Henry associates whose efforts produce these outstanding financial results. Thank you for joining us today. And Laura, will you please provide the replay number? Operator : The replay number for today's call is (877) 344-7529 and the access code is 9025867. The conference has now concluded.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vance Sherard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Vance Sherard : Thank you, Alan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry third quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me on the call today is David Foss, Board Chair and CEO; Mimi Carsley, CFO and Treasurer; and Greg Adelson, President and COO. After my opening remarks, I will turn the call over to Dave for his comments on our business and the industry. After Dave concludes his comments, Greg will discuss our recent strategic benchmark survey recent success metrics for multiple solutions, our strategic focus on AI plus other key initiatives. Mimi will then provide commentary around the financial results and updated guidance included in the press release issued yesterday that is available from the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website. Concluding our prepared remarks, Dave will add some closing comments. We will then open the lines for Q&A. As a reminder, this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to multiple factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to multiple risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled risk factors and forward-looking statements. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures are in yesterday's press release. I will now turn the call over to Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Vance. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin today's call by remembering Jack Henry Board member, Laura Kelly, who passed away unexpectedly on March 15. Laura served on our Board for over a decade and was a cherished colleague and friend to all who had the privilege of working with her. With over 30 years of experience in senior leadership roles, she brought invaluable insights, wisdom and financial expertise to our organization. Beyond her remarkable professional achievements, Laura was known for her kindness, generosity and unwavering dedication to making a positive impact. Our thoughts and deepest condolences go out to John and Jake and the rest of Laura's family during this incredibly difficult time. Let's now transition to our quarterly results. We're very pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue growth and overall business performance. As always, I'd like to thank our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for the quarter. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, total revenue increased by 6% for the quarter and increased 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Operating income increased 3% for the quarter and increased 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Turning to the segments. We again had a strong quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue was up by 7% for the quarter and increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment performed very well, posting a 5% increase in revenue this quarter and a 6% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a solid quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with a 5% increase in revenue this quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis. As I highlighted in the press release, this was our best third quarter ever for sales bookings. During the quarter, we inked 11 competitive core takeaways with one of them being a multibillion-dollar institution. For the year, we've now signed six multibillion-dollar institutions topping last year's full-year total of five. Additionally, we signed seven deals to move existing in-house core clients to our private cloud environment. We are seeing strong interest in our new Financial Crimes Defender solution with 11 new contracts in Q3. Additionally, we signed 45 new contracts for our new Financial Crimes Defender fraud module, for the Zelle, FedNow and RTP payments networks that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect fraud and money laundering in real time. We continue to see success with our card processing solution, signing 14 new card processing clients this quarter. Our Banno digital banking platform remains very popular with 69 new signings in Q3 including 37 contracts for Banno business. We now have over 11.6 million users live on Banno and we're continuing to add approximately 200,000 users per month. Even with our strong sales success in Q3, we continued to replenish our sales pipeline and keep it near an all-time high. As we look towards the end of our fiscal year, we remain very optimistic about the industry, the demand for our solutions our ability to deliver outstanding service and our long-term prospects for success. With that, I'll turn it over to Greg for more detail on our solutions and businesses. Gregory Adelson : Thank you, Dave. As some of you have seen, we recently released the 2024 results from our Annual Strategy Benchmark survey. This survey offers insight into concerns, opportunities and technology priorities from bank and credit union CEOs. The survey indicated that 80% of bank and credit union CEOs plan to increase technology spending over the next two years. Of those, the largest segment, 35% plan to increase investments between 6% and 10%. We also inquired where they plan to invest over the next two years. The top four areas for planned investment were fraud detection, digital banking, data analytics and automation, all areas where Jack Henry has been investing and executing with innovative solutions through our technology modernization strategy. As previously announced, we recently launched our cloud-native AI-powered Financial Crimes Defender fraud detection platform. We now have 16 clients live and another 175 clients in the implementation queue. In addition, we announced in March the Financial Crimes Defender was named the best fraud prevention platform by fintech breakthrough, an independent market intelligent organization. Dave mentioned earlier that we have more than 11.6 million registered users on our cloud-native Banno digital banking platform. We continue to see strong interest in our recently launched Banno business solution that provides a modern banking experience for small and medium-sized businesses. As of March 31st, we had 124 clients live and about 70 additional clients in various stages of implementation. In terms of data analytics, we continue to make progress on our data broker and executive dashboard solutions. Both are part of the cloud-native API first Jack Henry platform. Data broker, which is currently in beta will eventually provide access to all of a client's Jack Henry data in a single repository with innovative AI intelligence capabilities. To complement the data broker solution, we are developing an executive dashboard with real-time event monitoring to help executives at our financial institutions make informed dynamic decisions throughout the day based on metrics they customize. Related to automation technology, one new Jack Henry platform offering, we haven't spoken much about yet is our cloud-native online deposit and loan account opening solution. This integrated solution will provide a seamless digital account opening experience for our clients that enables them to streamline processes, automate workflows and better serve both retail and commercial loan clients. We plan to begin the beta phase with clients in early calendar year 2025. The survey also found that 96% of our clients plan to add payment services over the next two years. We continue to offer a full range of payment solutions in our pay center application as well as other areas of our payment groups. As of March 31st, we had 312 clients using Zelle, 275 clients using RTP, the real-time payments network, which represents 48% of the live RTP clients and 190 clients using FedNow, representing 29% of the live FedNow clients. One final point on the survey findings. They were consistent with what we heard from our clients at our Annual Strategic Initiative Symposium in late April. While financial institutions are concerned about the increasing cost of deposits and impact to interest margins, there is a general feeling of optimism and less concerned about an economic slowdown this year versus what we heard a year ago. One topic we spent a lot of time discussing that the strategic initiative Symposium is artificial intelligence. We presented in detail Jack Henry's framework for building the necessary guardrails, education, training, use of acceptable tools, et cetera. We continue to actively identify opportunities to leverage AI, aiming to enhance client solutions and optimize internal process and work streams. Incorporating AI into select client solutions like financial crimes defender, data broker, executive dashboard and Banno conversations is part of that strategy. We are approaching AI deployment thoughtfully, ensuring it benefits our clients and associates and aligns with our commitment to data privacy, protection and security. Our strategy ensures we are responsibly bold and balanced. It's been about 18 months since our corporate rebranding initiative to retire the Symitar, ProfitStars and Jack Henry banking brands as we now simply go-to-market as Jack Henry. As we said at that time, uniting the brands reflects Jack Henry's role as a well-rounded financial technology provider and enables us to speak from a single consistent brand voice, one Jack Henry. We recently received results from an independent brand study that showed that Jack Henry's brand equity has increased by nine points in just 18 months. We specifically saw significant improvement with large regional financial institutions and millennials. This is important as we continue to execute on our strategy to provide innovative technology solutions to larger financial institutions beyond what we already provide today through both our payment and complementary groups. And millennials are a critical audience because they are taking on larger leadership roles at these financial institutions and having more influence and technology buyer decisions. Speaking of brand equity, hopefully, you all have seen the new corporate sustainability report that we published on March 29th. We believe the 2024 report is an excellent representation of the key initiatives and accomplishments we've been working on over the past year. This year's report details how we are, we're supporting local communities with a focus on financial wellness through both our investments and innovative technology in a variety of philanthropic efforts. We also continue to further our commitment to valuing people with disabilities with the launch of a new associate-led business innovation group focused on awareness of visible and invisible disabilities. The report also highlights some of the public Best Places to Work recognition we received from organizations like Newsweek, Computer World, and USA Today. As part of our planned organizational changes, we recently announced the promotion of Shannon McLaughlin, who is currently President of Jack Henry Credit Union Solutions to Chief Operating Officer effective July 1st. Shannon has been with Jack Henry for nine years, but has close to 30 years working with both banks and credit unions and senior technology and operational roles. Shannon is a strategic visionary leader who has significantly contributed to our company's overall success, and we'll continue to do so as the next Chief Operating Officer. I want to close by recognizing Dave for the exceptional job he has done as CEO over the past eight years. Under Dave's leadership, Jack Henry has experienced outstanding growth both organically and through strategic acquisitions. I also want to thank Dave for his mentorship and guidance. He has prepared me well as I step into the CEO role on July 1st, and I'm honored to continue leading our company with an unwavering focus on our associates, clients and shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Mimi for more details on the numbers. Mimi Carsley : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Our continued focus on serving our community and regional financial institution clients, delivering shareholder value led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. I'll start with the details driving our third quarter and year-to-date results, then conclude with our full-year guidance update. Q3 GAAP revenue increased 6% and non-GAAP revenue increased 7%, a continuation of consistently solid performance and keeping us on track for a strong fiscal 2024. Year-to-date growth was 7% on a GAAP basis and stronger on non-GAAP at 8%. Deconversion revenue of approximately $800,000, which we pre-released last week, was down approximately $5.3 million, reflecting minimal financial institution consolidation of our clients. Year-to-date deconversion revenue is $9.9 million, $7.2 million less than the prior period. Now let's look more closely at the details. GAAP services and support revenue increased 4%, while non-GAAP increased a more robust 6%. Year-to-date, the increase was 6% for GAAP and 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Service and support growth during the quarter was the result of increases in data processing and hosting revenues. We continue to experience robust growth in our private and public cloud offerings, which again increased 10% in the quarter and for the year-to-date. This reoccurring revenue contributor is 32% of our total revenue and has long been a key to double-digit growth engine. Shifting to processing revenue, which is 43% of total revenue and another key component of our long-term growth model. We saw positive performance with 8% growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and year-to-date delivered 9% for both. Consistent with recent results, drivers include positive demand for our digital solutions, card processing, other payment processing and other processing revenues. In closing out revenue commentary, I would like to highlight total recurring revenue exceeded 91%. Next, moving to expenses. Beginning with cost of revenue, which increased 7% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and 7% for GAAP versus 6% for non-GAAP year-to-date. Drivers for the quarter included higher direct costs consistent with increases in related revenue, higher personnel costs and increased internal license and fees. Next, R&D increased 4% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter. The increase is primarily due to cloud consumption costs net of capitalization. For the year-to-date, R&D increased 4% on a GAAP basis and 3% for non-GAAP. And lastly, on a GAAP basis, SG&A rose 7% for the quarter and 8% on a non-GAAP basis primarily due to higher personnel costs. Year-to-date SG&A expense increased 23% on a GAAP basis and 9% on a non-GAAP basis. The primary GAAP differences are the $16.4 million in onetime related costs related to the voluntary early departure incentive program. [indiscernible] in Q1 and prior period $7.4 million gain on asset sales. For non-GAAP, the difference is primarily due to the higher personnel costs and absence of gain on sale of assets. We remain focused on generating compounding margin expansion and the quarter results delivered 30 basis points of increased non-GAAP margin, which was 20.8%. Non-GAAP margin benefited from focused process improvements and disciplined management of our workforce, while retaining key talent. These strong quarterly results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.19, up 7%. Separating results into the 3 operating segments, we're pleased to see across the board positive performance. Our core segment revenue increased 8% for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis, with non-GAAP operating margins increasing 216 basis points. We continue to benefit from private cloud trends and strong cost control. Year-to-date, non-GAAP revenue growth was 8% and the associated margin increased 124 basis points. Payments segment revenue increased 6% on a non-GAAP basis. The segment had impressive non-GAAP operating margin growth of 121 basis points. This was due to continuing growth in our EPS business, and moderate card growth consistent with U.S. consumer spending trends and a slightly tough comp combined with the focused cost management. Year-to-date, non-GAAP revenue growth matched the quarter at 6% with 103 basis points of margin expansion. And finally, complementary segment, non-GAAP revenue increased 8% with 33 basis points of margin expansion. Year-to-date, non-GAAP revenue also increased 8% with 28 basis points of margin expansion. Growth year-to-date reflects digital solution demand and beneficial overall product mix. Segment quarterly margins were impacted by moderate headwinds from direct support costs and license and fees. Let's now turn to a review of cash flow and capital allocation. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $336 million, $129 million increase over prior period. Excluding proceeds from the sale of assets, free cash flow was $172 million, significantly more than the $54 million last year. Our base case entering the year included an elevated level of cash tax payments based on the Section 174 impact. Based on legislative clarity and internal efforts, we were able to meaningfully lessen the impact. The net result was lower cash taxes equating to an approximately $29 million overpayment last fiscal year, as well as improved cash tax outlook this fiscal year. Our consistent dedication to share value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 19%. Additionally, I would highlight other notable return on capital metrics for the year-to-date period, including $20 million in share repurchase offsetting annual dilution, $25 million in debt reduction and $116 million in dividends. With three quarters of the year complete, we're nearing the conclusion of our fiscal year, and therefore, I'll conclude with guidance changes. As you're aware, yesterday's press release included updated fiscal 2024 full-year GAAP guidance along with a reconciliation to non-GAAP metrics. As a reminder, we filed an 8-K on August 3rd that described how starting in the current fiscal year, we're using a revised approach for deconversion guidance. While we reported third quarter deconversion revenue of approximately $800,000, we are reiterating our full year deconversion guidance of $16 million. We are reiterating both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue growth and expect non-GAAP growth to potentially have a bias towards the lower end of our 7.4% to 8.0% growth range. Due to the continued positive operational results and a focus on cost management, we now expect an increase in annual non-GAAP margin expansion of 45 to 50 basis points compared to the 35 to 40 basis points previously provided. The full-year tax rate estimate remains at 23.5%. Incorporating the noted positive update, full-year guidance for GAAP EPS is revised upward to $5.15 to $5.19 per share from the previous guidance of $5.09 to $5.13 per share. As a reminder, the guidance or deconversion revenue compared to actual fiscal 2023 deconversion revenue, VEDIP, severance-related costs and nonrecurring gain on asset sales results in approximate $0.37 headwind for GAAP EPS for fiscal 2024. Due to the better than initially anticipated cash tax payments, improved margins and contributions from favorable net interest, our full year guidance for free cash flow conversion has increased to 70% to 75% from the previous commentary of 60%. In conclusion, Q3 results reflected continued momentum of the strong execution we've seen thus far this year and we expect a solid finish for the remainder of the fiscal year. We remain exceptionally positive about our ability to deliver innovative and in-demand solutions, the resilience of our clients and our focus on execution and shareholder value creation. We appreciate the contributions of our diligent and dedicated associates that drove these strong results in Jack Henry investors for their continued confidence. Before I turn the call back over to Dave for closing remarks. While I haven't had the pleasure of working with Dave as long as others, I cherished our time together. I want to thank Dave for giving me the opportunity to work for this amazing company for being so incredibly generous with his wisdom and support for so many small and meaningful pieces of guidance over the past two years. He is a role model of service, leadership and doing the right thing. We are fortunate to have him lead the Jack Henry Board, and I look forward to this continued journey together. Dave? David Foss : Well, thank you, Mimi. As you are all undoubtedly aware, this marks my final earnings call as CEO before my transition to Executive Board Chair on July 1st. Reflecting on my career at Jack Henry, this has been an incredibly humbling journey for me, both personally and professionally. And I'm beyond grateful to have had the opportunity to lead this great company for the past eight years. As we move forward, I have the utmost confidence in Greg and the rest of our exceptional team to sustain our reputation for great technology and service as well as our strong financial performance. I've cherished the opportunity to get to know all of you over the years and appreciate your insightful questions and thorough analysis. I thank our investors for their trust in Jack Henry and our clients for allowing us to serve their needs. And lastly, I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to our associates. It is their dedication and unwavering commitment to supporting our clients and each other that drives our success and makes this company special. With that, we'll open up the floor for questions. Alan, if you would, please open the line. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Kartik Mehta : Well, Dave, it's been good talking to all these calls. We'll miss speaking with you in the future, at least on the calls anyways. David Foss : Thank you, Kartik. Kartik Mehta : Dave, I wanted to get your perspective on maybe just the backlog. I know, Mimi, you said, as you're expecting maybe the lower end of the non-GAAP revenue for fiscal '24, and maybe backlog is a wrong word to use. But just your perspective on based on what the sales pipeline looks like, and how good you feel about as we move forward, the ability to predict revenue and maybe why the lower end of the guidance. David Foss : So I'll give you my perspective, and then I'll ask Mimi to comment. So first off, I mentioned in the release and in my comments that this was a -- the best sales quarter we've ever -- best third quarter sales quarter we've ever had. And I also highlighted the fact that the sales pipeline has been replenished almost to that same record level that it was at last quarter. So as I see what's going on in the sales pipeline, but even more importantly, as I see what's happening here in the quarter that we're in right now, which, of course, we're not here to announce, I feel really bullish about the future opportunity as far as sales at Jack Henry and our ability to continue to deliver. So that's a sales perspective. I'll ask Mimi to go -- oh, did you want to say something. Gregory Adelson : Well, let me just add this. So I think the other thing is that we've had unbelievable sales success this year. But as we've highlighted many times, the deals that we're selling this year, for the most part, don't actually become revenue opportunities until future years and future quarters. So I think part of this is, yes, there are some things that are in an implementation queue and we're working through all those as we always do. But there isn't really anything that is signaling anything other than hopefully future success based on what we've seen. So I just want to make sure that you understand that all of the sales success we're seeing right now will be in future quarters. Mimi Carsley : Yes. The only thing I would add, Kartik, is that we feel really good about all three operating segments revenue. The total revenue is still very much in line with our long-term algorithm and what we thought about at the beginning of the year. There is a part of our business that does relate to economic factors in U.S. [indiscernible] that's the card business. So I think as we look out for the year, we feel really confident about our ability to hit that range. Kartik Mehta : Perfect. And then, Greg, just you talked about AI and maybe the opportunities in there. But I'm wondering for Jack Henry, is there an opportunity for you to use it internally and could that lower cost? And if so, is there an upfront cost that you're dealing with in an effort to implement that? Gregory Adelson : Yes, it's a great question, Kartik. So the short answer is we are spending a lot of time on internal operational efficiency opportunities throughout our entire organization. In fact, we most recently had a corporate leadership team meeting where each of the individual business units and nonoperating business units all presented their ideas for utilization of AI and specifically generative AI. And so we're going through prioritization. We've done a really good job of spending time making sure that we're focused on building the efficiencies first. Getting the learnings and all the other stuff. We've just approved a couple of utilizations for the Microsoft copilot for internal use and the GitHub codeveloper stuff for the developers -- or copilot, sorry. And we're actually in the process of going through all of those things and looking for ways that we can continue to build efficiency and effectiveness first as we're actually doing some other things within some of our products that I announced as well. Mimi Carsley : The only thing I would add on there as Greg said, responsibly bold and balance is our approach, and that covers both the usage as well as the investment. And so we're using the internal existing policies and processes to prioritize, to develop business cases, to think about the benefits, not -- this isn't just a curiosity. There has to be business cases. And so all of that will still sit within our planned budget and R&D and internal expense policies. Kartik Mehta : Perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Schmidt of Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Schmidt : Hi, Dave, Greg, Mimi. Thanks for taking my questions. And Dave congrats again on the transition. David Foss : Thank you. Andrew Schmidt : Want to start on the margin front. Good performance here. Mimi, maybe you could put a finer point on this. I know that there were some -- you mentioned some operational efficiencies that drove this maybe some mix factors as well. But maybe a finer point on that. And then as we think about the go-forward margin trajectory, it seems like you're above this year, kind of what you've outlined for the longer term. So how does this -- this year's margin performance kind of inform the view on the longer-term margin progression? Thanks a lot. Mimi Carsley : You're welcome. So Andrew, I would say for this year, it came down to strong execution, operational focus, it's a bit of product mix as well, but we're being very diligent around headcount, around spending for the year. There's also some timing around products and how that amortization impacts us as well, which is also something that we're just going to be thoughtful about for next year. It's really early still in our budget planning. Our teams are getting together and thinking about the prioritization I would say at this point, still thinking about that long-term range we've given versus an elevated state, but we're always trying to deliver shareholder value. And so that's going to always be a focus for us. Andrew Schmidt : Perfect. And then maybe just digging into the average contract size of recent cohorts. I know the attach rates have gone up over the past few years, but maybe you can put just a finer point in terms of what you're seeing in terms of just a complementary product adoption and just average contract sizes perhaps recent periods versus maybe a year or two years ago. Thank you very much. David Foss : Andrew, it's Dave. So one of the challenges in this, whenever we have a conversation like this is there is no such thing as average when it comes to our contracts. You're correct. The attach rates tend to be high with our core clients. But remember, we sell a lot of solutions that are outside the core base and the variety of solutions that we sell roughly 300 different solutions. They range from very small ticket price to very large ticket price. Most of the solutions -- almost everything we sell today is hosted. So it's rare for us to sell a licensed version of a solution. Well, then in the hosted contract or are they going to be hosted for three years or 10 years or so they're trying to talk about average is pretty challenging. The best indicator because we have used the same measurement approach for sales quota attainment for many years now, the best measure is the fact that, as I just mentioned, Q3 was the best Q3 we've ever had. That's the most significant indicator of sales success is the fact that -- we've used the same way of measuring contracts for many years. And so it's a good relative performance indicator for our sales organization. and sales overall are up. So I know it's frustrating to not be able to talk about averages, but it's just really not a practical thing to try and do in our world. Andrew Schmidt : No, it makes sense, yes. A lot of different shapes and sizes that they're [indiscernible]. Congrats again, Dave. Thank you very much. Gregory Adelson : Thank you. David Foss : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Darrin Peller : Thanks. And Dave, I want to -- also my congrats as well. [indiscernible] so always appreciate the help. Guys maybe just start off on a free cash discussion. If we could just revisit, it obviously has gone through its periods of strength above 80% and below 60%. Now you're saying back to 70%-plus. Maybe just give us a sense a little more on what the driving factors are and the sustainability of it now and -- maybe just help us understand if we're back to 80% going forward in the next couple of years? Mimi Carsley : Darrin, it has been a bit of a roller coaster ride. And in part, that was due to the lack of clarity from a legislative front. As we said on last quarter's call, we were hopeful the progress on Congress addressing the Section 174 R&D-related impact on cash taxes would go through -- we were optimistic, but not betting on that. But even in the absence of that, the clarity that the treasury to IRS our outside consultants, our incredible tax team here, Jack Henry have had has really helped us from being able to discover savings from a cash tax perspective that impacted effectively last year a benefit so that would mean less cash tax paid this year. And so even if that legislation does not get fully addressed, I think we're in an improved position versus where we thought earlier in the year. We're still hopeful that it will be addressed. But that's the biggest driver that represents over $29 million in last year's impact alone, let alone some additional for this year. So that's a biggest impact for the free cash flow. And I think that's a sustainable for the Dave board. Darrin Peller : Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. Greg maybe just on your side, if you just talk about what you're seeing in the market more specifically around demand for core commercial use order. Obviously, the cloud discussion we've had for some time now. Again just inflections you're seeing for specific products or offerings or maybe vice versa anything that's weaker? Any more color would be great. Thanks. Gregory Adelson : Yes, sure. So I think a couple of things as part of our survey and even just obviously with our regular conferences and conversations with our clients, deposit growth continues to be a big driver. Operational efficiency continues to be. And that's why we really highlighted some of those key products that we're already focused on and fraud being a big one, things that we're already focused on and driving out in the market set and we're continuing to see some nice pickup in all of those. So those continue to be big ones. I think related to the tech modernization and what we're doing with our modules. We're continuing to have a lot of success on the execution side of that. We'll continue to talk more about that in future calls. But right now, we're really excited about what we've done with data broker and executive dashboard. We think those are some products that really are not out there in the space today and we'll continue to create an opportunity for us to show the advancement of what we're doing in our cloud native technology and utilization of generative AI as part of that. So all of those will kind of tie in to what the demand has been around deposits, fraud opportunities, operational efficiency as the three big things. Darrin Peller : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Vasu Govil of KBW. Vasundhara Govil : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess first quick one for Mimi. I know it's a little too early to talk about the '25 outlook, but just based on the new sales momentum that you've had this year, it seems like you're setting up for stable, if not accelerating revenue growth into next year. Any reason to think that may not be the case? And then Mimi if you could also specifically comment on the payment segment, trending slightly softer than we would have thought, just how it performed relative to internal expectations and what you're expecting for the go-forward trend line there? Mimi Carsley : So Vasu, I wish I could tell you with more precision the next year targets, but it's just a little too early. We're still during the budget process. But there's no reason to have any other expectation than grow the algorithm at a high level. There are some things that present challenges each year from a grow-over perspective that even though we're having tremendous success with the sales pipeline, there's lower convert merge that impacted this year. You just never know from a grow-over perspective. But I think the growth algorithm is a pretty good framework to think about for next year. As it relates to this year and the payments question, I would say that, that really -- to categorize it, we saw slower transaction growth broadly slower growth in debit. And that was in line with all of the major card network providers and U.S. trends we've seen and a tough comp, but we're reiterating the full-year guide, and we feel comfortable in that 7% to 8% growth algorithm is still an appropriate level. Vasundhara Govil : Thank you for that. And then, Dave, I want to add, I've really enjoyed working with you the last few years, and you will certainly be missed. One high-level question for you. Three big players that have the majority of the share in the industry, but the number of Fintechs that are going after the opportunity is larger today than it probably was a few years ago. So how do you see the competitive landscape evolving over the next three to five years? David Foss : Yes. So first off, thank you, Vasu. It's been fun. So it's interesting. These people trying to come into the U.S. market and provide competing services to players like us has been going on for quite a while now. And the challenge for many of them is approach it from a technology point of view as opposed from a banking point of view. And so they come in thinking, \"Hey, I can deliver a greater user experience, something that's cooler and more fun\", but they don't realize how really difficult it is to do the heavy lifting that behind the scenes that you don't see. It's the work that's not sexy, but it's the work that has to be done for a bank, you need to be successful. And so we've seen many come into the U.S. market trying to deliver a solution, don't understand the regulatory environment, don't really understand all the heavy lifting that happens underneath. And then they kind of back away and maybe turn their solution into a digital banking solution or something like that. And so I don't view what's going on today is really any different from that. There are people out there, and they're smart people, but I think the complexity of all the things you have to do to keep a bank or credit union operating and in balance and all those important things is often times overlooked. So we have our eyes wide open, we are not pretending that nobody is a threat. And we follow a lot of different companies. But today isn't really in my mind any different than it was five years ago where a lot of people were talking, a lot of people were trying to figure out how to really take a foothold in this industry. And it's just really difficult to do all the things that we do. So I don't see that changing anytime soon. Vasundhara Govil : Thank you for the color. Operator : The next question comes from Tyler DuPont of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Tyler DuPont : Hi, good morning. This is Tyler on for Jason. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start by asking about the progress in rolling out some of the complementary solutions such as that a business financial tenders outside the core. Can you maybe just level set where we are today with that rollout. If I remember right, the target was some sort of implementation by the end of F '24 and just sort of when you think this might be needle moving going forward? Any clarity there? Gregory Adelson : Yes. This is Greg. So I'll take that one. So as far as execution, we're moving forward. We had talked about being able to sell it at the end of this calendar year, and we'll be able to start doing that in Q4. Execution and planned implementation will be in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year '25 -- second year -- or second quarter of the calendar year '25. That will be the planned implementations. As we mentioned earlier, we were going to take this in a very strategic fashion going after just a handful of competitive course. We're focused on working through one right now. You have to get some level of cooperation to do some of what we're doing as well. So some of that gets kind of in the documentation and working through some of those kind of idiosyncrasies that what you need. But as far as our plan is on track to have Banno business, our CPS card product and Financial Crimes Defender, all three of those products that today that do not go outside of the Jack Henry core base to be available all at the same time and offer the first specific core that we're targeting and then we'll be working through the other things. So as far as answering your question of when it will have any significant impact it will be a little while for that to happen. And -- but the reality is we think the stickiness of what we're doing with those particular products will help us with some other things in selling other solutions and other opportunities. David Foss : Can I offer just one clarification to your question, Tyler, just to make sure we're on the same page here. So what Greg has talked about is these brand-new solutions that we're rolling into outside the base. But we have thousands and thousands of deployments of other solutions to non-Jack Henry core customers. So I just want to make sure there's no confusion about we've been selling outside the core base for many years, thousands of -- in fact, I think we have more customers, more banks and credit unions running our bill pay solution who are not Jack Henry core customers than who are Jack Henry core customers, and that's true for a number of other solutions. So I just want to make sure we're clear on the fact that we know how to sell outside the base. it's just the strategy around these brand new solutions that we've been really kind of talking about and thoughtful about. Tyler DuPont : Okay. Understood. I appreciate the clarity there. And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to jump off of the previous competitive positioning question but from a slightly different angle. Can you discuss any signs of success you're seeing or any trends you've seen with moving a little bit more into the mid-market financial institutions playing field, if you will, sort of what trends you're seeing there, if there's any different go-to-market that you need to implement? I know you mentioned that there was a couple of multibillion-dollar signings over the past several quarters, but just any update there? Gregory Adelson : Yes. Sure. This is Greg again. So I'll take that. So as we've mentioned previously, and there's still all in the queue, we have three $20 billion plus opportunities in our current pipeline, and we continue to work those and continue to make progress on those. But I would say that even in the multibillion space, let's just call it the $5 billion to $15 billion we're continuing to see more and more opportunities in there. And I would say the biggest drivers really are the technology modernization strategy that we have articulated and what folks are seeing for the future. And more importantly, what we've already executed on as you can imagine, most people want to see that it's not just a sales pitch. It's some level of execution, and we continue to show advancements on what we've done, where we're going. And things along that line. So that has really helped us continue to move and progress in the sales pipeline with many of these larger opportunities. So I think what you're going to continue to see is what we're doing on the technology side, what we've always been known from the service side continue to create those opportunities. Tyler DuPont : Great, thanks Greg. That is very helpful. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Koning of Baird. Please go ahead. David Koning : Hey guys, congrats, Dave. Great career. And I guess, First of all, I guess, just kind of two kind of cleanup questions. Corporate revenue was lower than normal or than recently. I think as the conference wasn't in the quarter, but then cost -- corporate costs were higher than usual. What's just the dynamic there? And do those go back down in the coming quarters? Mimi Carsley : Yes, I think I wouldn't read anything into just like a one quarter. We did have -- relative to last quarter, we talked about that the annual merit increase is hit in Q3. So from a cost perspective, that's where you saw personnel cost go up. The revenue it could just be hardware or as you mentioned last quarter was the conference, but I would not read too much into that. David Koning : Okay. Okay. And then one other one. I think you had a negative term fee in complementary. And then I think you actually had a small EBIT loss on term fees. Both of those, I don't know if you've ever seen those dynamics before either of those. And maybe just -- I know it was such a small term few quarter anyway, but just describe kind of how that happens and if that's one-off. Mimi Carsley : Yes. This is certainly a one-off. So as you know, for deconversions, we do get a little bit of notice once they start the file transfer process. So we were informed that a financial institution had planned to deconvert and then later postpone the timing and delay. And so there was a bit of a reversal on that transaction. David Foss : And this is something Dave -- I mean, I've been doing this a long time. I don't remember the last time I saw this, but this was essentially a customer that was recruited away by a competitor, and they had a failed conversion and so decided that they needed to back out of that and come back to Jack Henry. So I don't ever remember that happening and certainly haven't seen a failed conversion in our industry for many, many years. So this was a real unique situation. David Koning : That's great to hear. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette : Great, thank you very much. And I also want to extend my thanks to Dave for all the hard work you put in on behalf of Jack Henry over the years. I wanted to quickly maybe take advantage of Greg and Dave being here and dig in a little bit on your commentary about customer sentiment. I'd love to get your thoughts on the regulatory scrutiny that banks are going through right now, which seems to be picking up as several of the banks have alluded to plans to adjust their capital liquidity and CRE concentrations over the next several quarters. That doesn't seem to be impacting your bookings and sales performance, but curious if the topic of greater regulatory scrutiny is coming up with customers and how you're thinking about what you can do to help those customers as they deal with that. David Foss : So greater regulatory scrutiny is absolutely in the conversation very regularly these days. And really, since the -- like that's May of last year, the period where there was all this consternation on what was happening in regional banking space. Since that time, the regulatory environment has changed pretty dramatically for, I think all of our customers on the banking side. And so there's a lot of conversation about that. It is interesting, however, that has not had any impact on bookings. And one of the things that I say regularly now is if you're running a bank or credit union, almost any challenge you have, almost any problem you need to solve in this day and age in 2024, the solution involves technology. It doesn't involve usually people because they're trying to figure out how to automate or how to use technology to either mitigate risk or grow the franchise or something like that. And so I think because of the world we live in today where technology is almost always part of the solution, that's why, regardless of what's going on with the regulators there is an opportunity for us to help them using some type of technology solution, either like I say, to grow the franchise or to mitigate risk or deal with fraud or whatever it is. So I haven't seen any or heard and we just did a client conference in Kansas City about three weeks ago, no discussion about backing off on spending on technology or things like that in fact, the survey that Greg just cited, there was an expected increase in tech spending for the coming year. And so those would be my observations, but I'll refer to Greg, if you want to. Gregory Adelson : No, I think you were pretty complete. I think the part that I would say is that the technology component really is the driver here is that more and more folks are recognizing for them to continue to be able to punch above their weight, especially in the community bank space is that they're looking for technology to stay to the level of relevancy that they need to be. And that's why we've been so adamant on our focused execution on getting these products out and giving us and our institutions an opportunity to do that. James Faucette : Got it. Thank you for that. And then I want to turn quickly, Greg, to implementation, and you mentioned implementation cues. How are those trending broadly? And how are you thinking about the puts and takes between margin expansion you're delivering versus the potential for additional resource allocations to speed up those implementations? Just walk us through the thought process and what you're dealing with from a current demand perspective there? Gregory Adelson : Yes, it's a great question. And it is absolutely something that we look at truly every month with our teams through -- we go through a very detailed financial analysis and variance reviews with each of our business unit leaders and those discussions always take place. And so Mimi already referenced the kind of business cases. And so we actually take a business case approach where we look at what we may need to add relative to enhancing the implementation queue, what kind of value are we able to provide both from an immediate revenue standpoint, helping kind of relieve some pressure on the sales side, things along that line. So we actually have done that multiple times this year where we've added resources to accelerate queues or to do things differently. We're also constantly looking at process improvements that we can do both from a systemic standpoint or just general process improvements, obviously, the questions that were asked about AI earlier, we're looking at ways that AI might be able to help us with some of those. But to answer your question, we are constantly evaluating both sides, but we also recognize as long as we can continue to move that queue forward and it makes sense, then we're going to add people to make sure that, that happens. James Faucette : Great. Thanks for that, Greg. Gregory Adelson : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Nabhan of Stephens. Please go ahead. Charles Nabhan : Great, good morning. And thank you for taking my question. And I just want to echo everybody's gratitude and congratulations, Dave. It's been great working with you. I just want to wish you all the best. So I wanted to follow up with the earlier question on some of the progress you've made in the middle market and just get a better understanding of how we should think about some of those larger relative banks from an ARPU standpoint as well as their product consumption in terms of like what products there -- how it compares to some of your -- the smaller banks in your customer base, what they're buying, what they're not buying, and what's helping you win those deals as well. Gregory Adelson : Yes. So I'll go ahead and take this. This is Greg. So I think as far as the deals that we've won, so the six multibillion that Dave referenced this year, I'd say there hasn't been a significant alternative to any of the solutions that we typically sell. What's helping is what I described earlier, not only the strategy for the future, but what we've executed on the present, which is around Financial Crimes, around Banno and specifically Banno Business, what we've done in our payments markets and things along that line. So those continue to be huge drivers of opportunity and maybe even more specifically than what we see just specifically in a core offering because those complementary products really help drive the core decisions, to be honest with you. As we continue to go to the larger ones, so the $20 billion plus that I've talked about, still a lot of the same interest. The question will be is, where are they in some of their current relationships. More importantly, they buy -- tend to buy a little bit fewer products. They tend to not do everything with one particular vendor. So as we're working through the dynamics of specifically those three larger ones that I've referenced, but we're also seeing some larger ones where a product or two of Jack Henry, especially as we start to look outside of the Jack Henry core base and be able to take some of these products, we're getting one-off opportunities and two-off opportunities from larger institutions that are more than the $50 billion that we have today. So I think you'll continue to see that evolution as we continue to drive things outside of the Jack Henry base. But as we've referenced before, we have complementary and payment products today in institutions that are as large as $200 billion. So that's not foreign to us. Charles Nabhan : Great. Thank you. And as a follow-up, I just wanted to get your general thoughts on M&A and consolidation in the bank space. There's been a handful of deals announced in the past month. And it seems like the regulatory scrutiny that you had alluded to could be a catalyst for consolidation. But as you think about the next year or two, I just wanted to get your general thoughts on M&A in the bank and the credit union space? Gregory Adelson : Yes, another good question. So we are continuing to see that. As we've referenced, I think in our last earnings call that we have started to add some staff relative to that, especially on the credit unions side, where we've seen even more of that -- of those opportunities. But we're seeing more on the banking side than we did just a few months ago. Part of the challenge though is the timing of when those are expected to be completed. So we've actually had a couple of our institutions that have acquired other institutions -- competitive institutions for that matter. And -- but there -- the ability for them to be able to complete those have been delayed by regulatory challenges. So in some cases, five and six months. So will that continue to be a challenge? That remains to be seen. But I think what's happening right now, especially in the market with -- and especially we'll see what happens with the election. But we're continuing to see some challenges with the timing of when those things can be completed, not necessarily the interest in doing them. Mimi Carsley : I would just add on that, that creates a little bit of a headwind for us this year. We talked about the lower deconversion revenue of people leaving that also impacts us from the convert merge. And in Q3, we saw approximately $3.5 million less year-over-year in convert merge revenue. Gregory Adelson : I will just finalize with one last comment is that you are absolutely right that when we have our conversations with our institutions as well as what we just had in Kansas City, the interest level in continuing to look at M&A opportunities is very, very relevant in part of their overall strategies. Charles Nabhan : Got it, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Davis of Raymond James. Please go ahead. John Davis : Hey, good morning guys. And Dave, I'll echo my congrats. You'll be missed. But maybe before you go or maybe Greg can hop in here. But just thoughts on capital allocation. We're talking about free cash flow conversion going up. It looks like you guys haven't bought back stock in a couple of quarters. balance sheet is in good shape. So just broader thoughts on capital allocation, maybe more specifically, buybacks. David Foss : You've heard me talk about the capital allocation 1,000 times JD. So I'll defer to Greg for that one. Gregory Adelson : Well, I think we continue to look at opportunities to buy back. And I know Mimi has done a great job of presenting use cases and timing. So we're continuing to look at that. Obviously, we're focused on free cash flow and the opportunities of continuing to improve that. So the opportunities are closer to that than they were in the past. Mimi Carsley : Yes. And J.D., I would just add on, we always look to, first, is there investments within our own business to accelerate growth. We've been at that 14% R&D for quite some time, but we're always open to think about ways to accelerate our strategy and where we can continue to serve our clients through investments in technology. So that's always a prioritization. And then the other is we're expecting to pay down the debt substantially. So one thing I would note just from a call out for folks for modeling purposes, you'll see in the next quarter, a reclassification of our debt. The term loan A goes current in May in a couple of weeks here. And as we plan to, well, being very mindful of the current ratio, we do anticipate paying that down and shifting some of that to the revolver. So it's not common that a lot of people let their debt go current, but we intend to pay it off. John Davis : Okay. Great. And then, Greg, it seems like Banno Business is off to a pretty good start. I just would love to get your thoughts longer term where you see the mix of like Banno Business versus retail. I know we're really early innings today, but just how you think about that over the next, call it, three to five years, just the mix between retail and business in Banno? Gregory Adelson : Yes. Well, we continue -- to your point, I mean, there's part that I think is important for you to understand is that how we do the revenue model for this is that we basically -- it's an add-on to each of -- so the 11.6 million registered users that Dave alluded to, any of our institutions that have a commercial focus that want to add Banno Business, then that add-on price is added to all of their registered users regardless of whether they are being utilized in a business application or not. As you can imagine, there's a lot of small business owners that are hiding in a retail presence today. And so this creates the opportunity to do both. So for our benefit, any institution that has interest in buying Banno Business, it gets applied to all of their active registered users versus just ones that are kind of allocated to a business application. So that's great for us, and that's kind of how we built the model. As far as, again, continued success, we think there's a huge opportunity on the credit union side of our business as we continue to see more and more credit unions get focused on this side. And that's been a lot of the opportunities that we have right now. And then I think more importantly, as we do take the product outside of the Jack Henry base, we think we're going to be able to go -- take the product further up market, maybe even to some institutions that are much larger than the ones that we support today as part of that. John Davis : Okay. And then maybe just -- I really appreciate the clarification there, but maybe the better way to rephrase is, what kind of adoption or what percentage of banks adopting of your current base adopting Banno Business, would you guys kind of consider success over the next, let's call it, three or five years? Is it 30%, 40%, 80%? Just trying to some guidepost on how thinking about that longer term? Gregory Adelson : I'd say roughly, it's in the 60% to 70% just because a lot of our institutions are commercially focused already. So I would say anything north of 60% would be a fairly decent target. David Foss : I won't be here anymore. Can I vote for 100%. Gregory Adelson : I don't know if we'll get 100%. I'm not promising. But I really do believe that the -- what we've seen today based on where we are today, anywhere from 60% to 70% is probably a reasonable approach. John Davis : Okay, appreciate it. Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Cris Kennedy of William Blair. Please go ahead. Cristopher Kennedy : Good morning. Thank you for fitting me in. And I'll echo all the comments for Dave. Just one last one. Just a follow-up to that last question. And clearly, Banno Business is a big initiative. But can you just talk about some of the other opportunities and initiatives that you have to capture that commercial banking opportunity, especially within small businesses? Gregory Adelson : Yes, it's a great comment. And actually from -- we have several different kind of what I would call, point-to-point solutions that we have. So we have a treasury management solution that we've talked about a lot. So there's a great opportunity to continue to drive that there. We have things that we're doing on the lending side and the account opening side for small businesses that we continue. We have a small business application in Bill Pay that we use a business bill pay application things that we do on the remote deposit capture side of our businesses as well. So we have a lot of point-to-point solutions that we utilize today, but one of the focuses that I have, and I've talked about this in individual meetings is a focus on building a cohesive SMB strategy, and we'll continue to talk more about what we're doing, not only with our existing products but what we plan to do as an overarching strategy and solution set. Cristopher Kennedy : Great, thank you. Thanks for fitting me in. Gregory Adelson : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from David Togut of Evercore. Please go ahead. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning and congratulations, Dave, since this is your last call as CEO, perhaps you could give us a final update on kind of the status of your credit card processing initiative. And then maybe to go along with that, you continue to call out the three big $20 billion asset banks in the pipe. How important is it to the bigger banks that you have a robust credit card processing offering, perhaps is that more important than it might be for the smaller FIs, which tend to be more debit focused? David Foss : Yes. I don't -- thank you, Dave. I don't think that it's a big item of consideration regardless of the size of the bank. It's all about where they are with their strategy, where they are with their relationship with whoever they're their process there is. The decision regarding core is a totally independent decision from who am I going to do debit and credit with and what am I looking for as far as functionality and all that. And I think that whole decision process has been conflated in the industry in the past few years as some of our competitors have tried to try to sell a narrative that if you have the quarter, you're going to get the card business that's not necessarily true. You have to provide great service and great product on the card side in order to win that business. So they're really divorced of each other. As far as the -- where are we at on the credit side, so I didn't mention in my script, but we did sign three additional credit customers in the quarter. So we're continuing to make progress there. But you'll recall, Dave, when I first started talking about our move and getting into credit, I said at the time, this will be a slow grower for us. It's not that everybody is looking for Jack Henry to offer credit, but there are some customers who want the same processor to provide debit and credit at the same time on the same platform. And so it was a necessary offering for us, but we never had an expectation that it was going to be a really fast grower or become a really significant part of our revenue stream and sure enough, that's the position that we're in today. But we have a very complete offering. We have a partnership with another entity to offer agent program. And so I think we're in a great position today, but it has lived up to the expectation that I set with you all years ago. Not a great big grower, not a great big piece of our portfolio, but a nice offering for those customers that want both together. David Togut : Understood, thanks so much. And congrats again, Dave. David Foss : Thank you, Dave. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Suchoski of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Kenneth Suchoski : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe I think I heard you say that for the full-year on non-GAAP revenue growth, I think you might come in towards the low end of that 7.4% to 8% growth range, which I think puts fiscal 4Q non-GAAP revenue growth, maybe slightly below 7%. So I just wanted to make sure I'm thinking about that right. Is there anything that would be driving maybe a slight deceleration. And I guess is that the right jumping off point for fiscal year '25. Mimi Carsley : Yes, Ken, I think that's just the way FY '24 is going to play out. We're still looking at that gross revenue within our growth algorithm of the seven to eight longer term, this year will hit within that range. Still, as I mentioned earlier, the payments business, we saw a little bit slower card, nothing that is out of line with what the card networks are seeing. But we believe that the consumer is resilient. We continue to see that. They're spending more per ticket but less tickets overall and us being transactional that is having a bit of an impact. So we're seeing really positive growth on card risk business, other monthly services. So it's just a little bit lower on that transactional growth. That's just the way the segments are playing out for this year for Q4. But I wouldn't say that, that has anything from a launching off point for next year of concern. Kenneth Suchoski : Okay. No, that's really helpful. And then it sounds -- I mean, it sounds like there's a lot of momentum behind Banno and Crimes Defender, we got a few questions just on the slowdown in complementary revenue growth, just I guess -- is there anything to call out there in terms of that slowdown just because Banno, I think is becoming a bigger part of the business and the user growth is quite strong. Mimi Carsley : No, you're right to call it. I mean digital has been a great growth engine for us, and we continue to see robust growth and demand for those solutions. I would say complementary is a portfolio of products. So there's nothing there from a slowing, and I wouldn't say it's slowed. I mean the numbers are really strong, and they're in line with what we expect year in and year out for the segment. Kenneth Suchoski : Yes. Okay. Great. Thanks so much. And Dave, congrats to you. David Foss : Thank you very much, Ken. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vance Sherard for any closing remarks. Vance Sherard : Thank you, Alan. Our Investor Day has historically been an annual May event. But starting this year, we are moving our Investor Day to September. The meeting will take place on Thursday, September 5, in Dallas. We hope you'll be able to join us and if interested attending in person, please let me know.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vance Sherard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Vance Sherard : Thank you, Drew. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. Joining me on the call today is President and CEO, Greg Adelson; and Mimi Carsley, CFO and Treasurer. After my opening remarks, I will turn the call over to Greg for his comments on our fourth quarter results and observations related to our business and the industry. Mimi will then provide commentary around the financial results and fiscal '25 guidance, included in the press release issued yesterday, that is available from the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website. We will then open the lines for Q&A. As a reminder, this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to multiple factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to multiple risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures are in yesterday's press release. I will now turn the call over to Greg. Greg Adelson : Thank you, Vance, and hello, everyone. I appreciate all of you joining this morning's call. We are very pleased to report strong sales and financial performance in the fourth quarter and for all of fiscal 2024. I want to especially thank all of our associates for your hard work, dedication and unwavering commitment that significantly contributed to these outstanding results. I will begin with a summary of what I believe are the three main takeaways and then provide additional detail on all areas of our business. We produced record revenue and operating income for fiscal '24 with $2.2 billion in revenue and $489.4 million in operating income. Our sales team set an all-time record for sales bookings for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year that included 22 competitive core wins in the quarter and 57 for the fiscal year. We signed 15 new core contracts this fiscal year, with financial institutions that have over $1 billion in assets compared to only five in fiscal 2023. This was a direct result of our technology modernization strategy and execution, One Jack Henry initiative, and several new innovative solutions. Now for more detail on each of these takeaways. For the fourth quarter, total revenue increased 5% and increased 6% on a non-GAAP basis. For the fiscal year, total revenue increased 7% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Operating income increased 1% for the quarter and increased 5% on a non-GAAP basis. For the fiscal year, operating income increased 2% and increased 10% on a non-GAAP basis. As I mentioned, the fourth quarter was the highest quarter for sales bookings in the history of the company, and we set a new record for sales bookings for the fiscal year. I am very proud of the remarkable year by our sales team. The 15 core clients signed with over $1 billion in assets also is a new fiscal year record. Of those clients, 10 are banks and five are credit unions. Over the past four years, we have continued to see an increase in the average asset size of our core clients. Average assets for our bank clients have increased to $1.35 billion, a 27% increase over the past four years. Average assets for our credit union clients have increased to $1.27 billion, a 34% increase over the past four years. In addition to the 22 competitive core takeaways in the quarter, we re-signed one long-term client with about $6 billion in assets that had provided the termination notice to us a little more than two years ago. That client never de-converted to the competing core platform. They've now re-signed with us for multiple years and multiple new solutions. While this contract is not in our new core win numbers, it is noteworthy that they decided their best choice was to stay with Jack Henry for multiple more years. For the quarter, we also signed 15 contracts to move existing in-house core clients to our private cloud environment. We finished fiscal '24 with 44 existing clients agreeing to move to our private cloud. We now host 73% of our core clients in our private cloud. Several of our complementary and payment solutions also experienced extremely high demand, with our digital suite leading the way. For the quarter, we signed 45 new clients to our Banno Retail platform as well as 50 new Banno Business deals. For the fiscal year, we closed 179 new Banno Retail contracts and 164 new Banno Business contracts. Banno continues to experience exceptional growth. We currently have 12.2 million registered Banno users as compared to 3.2 million at the same time in 2020. We have 924 Banno Retail clients, and of those, 147 are live with Banno Business and another 81 are in various stages of implementation. We also continued to see increasing success with our card processing solution, signing 21 new card processing clients this quarter and 56 for the fiscal year. We received 16 new Financial Crimes Defender contracts in Q4 and 52 for the fiscal year. In addition, we signed 53 new contracts for the Financial Crimes Defender faster payment fraud module for the quarter and 134 for the fiscal year. This real-time solution is designed to help mitigate fraud in Zelle, FedNow and real-time payment transactions. As of June 30, we have 52 Financial Crimes installations completed and another 115 in various stages of implementation. We also have 22 faster payment modules installed and 154 in various stages of implementation. I am asked regularly why I believe we continue to see significantly more new competitive core wins than our competition. While I believe there are many reasons, I've tried to boil it down to three primary themes. First, our associates. We have a happy and engaged workforce and we believe that leads to having a \"do whatever it takes\" attitude with our clients. Our associate engagement scores are well above the industry benchmark and we consistently win Best Workplace awards each year. We are pleased to recently receive recognition in three national publications : U.S. News & World Report's Best Companies to Work For, TIME Magazine's Best Mid-Sized Companies, and Newsweek's Greatest Workplaces. Second, our service quality, which is a direct result of our engaged and dedicated associates. We have long been known for providing exceptional customer service, and this year was no exception. In fiscal year 2024, our client satisfaction score when rating the engagement with a client service representative averaged 4.74 per month on a five-point scale. On that scale, a meets expectation is 3.0 and extremely satisfied is 5.0. You have to have a lot of fives to average a 4.74. The third theme is technology innovation. We continue to invest in technology to help our clients remain vibrant financial institutions in the markets they serve. We are executing our technology modernization strategy, while bringing new leading-edge solutions to the market before our competition. A couple of final items. We are looking forward to our annual client conference, Jack Henry Connect, in October. This is a great opportunity every year for us to meet with prospects, clients and partners. Last year, 17 of our new core wins were with prospects who attended the conference. As I reflect back on fiscal 2024, I want to again thank Dave Foss for his outstanding leadership as CEO for the past eight years. I am honored and humbled to take over as CEO and excited along with our entire leadership team about the opportunities ahead. We are executing on our strategy and our associate engagement and client satisfaction scores are consistently strong. Technology spending by financial institution remains robust and there's clear demand for our differentiated and innovative technology, as validated by our strong quarter and fiscal year. We are very well-positioned for future success. I look forward to seeing and speaking with many of you at our Investor Day in Dallas on September 5. We have an exciting agenda and we'll have several of our new business leaders available for a meet and greet as well. With that, I will turn it over to Mimi for more specifics on our financials. Mimi Carsley : Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Our continued focus on serving our community and regional financial institution clients and delivering shareholder value led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. I will start with the details driving our fourth quarter and full year results, then conclude with the fiscal '25 guidance. Q4 GAAP revenue increased 5% and non-GAAP revenue increased 6%, a continuation of the consistently solid performance. Full year growth was 7% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Fourth quarter deconversion revenue of approximately $7 million, which we pre-released, was down approximately $8 million, reflecting minimal financial institution consolidation of our clients. Full year deconversion revenue of $17 million, $15 million less than the prior year, was consistent with guidance. Now let's look more closely at the details. GAAP services and support revenue increased 2%, while non-GAAP increased 4%. For the year, the increase was a healthy 5% for GAAP and 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Services and support growth during the quarter was the result of volume increases in data processing and hosting revenue and consulting revenues, partly offset by decreases in deconversion, implementation and maintenance fee revenue. We continue to experience impressive growth in our private and public cloud offerings, which increased 11% in the quarter, 10% for the year. This reoccurring revenue contributor is 31% of our total revenue and has long been a key double-digit growth engine. Shifting to processing revenue, which is 42% of total revenue and another key component of our long-term growth model. We saw robust performance with 9% growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and for the year. Consistent with recent results, quarterly drivers included increased card, digital and payment processing revenue. Completing commentary on revenue, I would highlight that total reoccurring revenue exceeded 91%. Next, moving to expenses. Beginning with the cost of revenue, which increased 6% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and 7% for GAAP versus 6% for non-GAAP for the full fiscal year. Drivers for the quarter included higher direct costs, higher personnel costs and increased internal licenses and fees. Next, R&D expense increased 4% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter. The quarterly increase was primarily due to increased consulting and other professional services, net of capitalization, and a higher cloud consumption cost, net of capitalization. For the year, R&D expense increased 4% on GAAP basis and 3% for non-GAAP. Ending with SG&A expense, for the quarter, on a GAAP basis, it increased 6% and 13% on a non-GAAP basis. The quarter's GAAP increase was due to higher personnel costs and increased professional services. The non-GAAP quarterly increase was impacted by the one-time expense from the write-off of capitalized software development related to internal software tools. Without this one-time expense, the quarter increase would have been 8%. Full year SG&A expense increased 18% on a GAAP basis and 10% non-GAAP. The primary GAAP impacts were a $16 million in one-time costs related to the voluntary early departure incentive program, VEDIP, and a prior-period $5 million gain on asset sales. The non-GAAP increase is driven primarily by higher personnel costs. We remain focused on generating compounding margin expansion. While the quarter results delivered 22 basis points decrease in non-GAAP margin to 22%, full year margin expansion was 60 basis points on a non-GAAP margin of 23%. Non-GAAP margin benefited from the focused process improvements and disciplined management of our workforce. These strong quarterly results produced a fully-diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.38, up 3%. Fiscal '24 fully diluted EPS was $5.23, up 4%, facing a $0.37 headwind from previously mentioned VEDIP, a gain on asset disposal prior year and lower deconversion rates. Breaking down the results into the three operating segments, we are pleased to see positive performance across the board. Our core segment revenue increased 4% for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis against a tough comp. Non-GAAP operating margin increased 171 basis points. Core continues to benefit from private cloud trends and strong cost control. Full year non-GAAP revenue was 7% and associated margin increased 135 basis points. Payments segment quarterly revenue increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. The segment had impressive non-GAAP operating margin growth of 183 basis points. Revenue growth was due to continuing growth in our EPS business and strong card growth from fraud and card-related services, with [lower] (ph) growth consistent with US consumer spending trends. Margin benefited from focused cost management. And for the full year, non-GAAP revenue growth was 7%, with 124 basis points of margin expansion. Finally, complementary segment. Quarterly non-GAAP revenue increased 6%, with 75 basis points of margin contraction. Margin contraction was due to direct support costs, amortization and licenses and fees. Fiscal year non-GAAP revenue increased 8%, with 2 basis points of margin expansion. Full year growth continued to reflect digital solution demand and beneficial overall product mix. Now, let's turn to a review of cash flow and capital allocation. Fiscal '24 operating cash flow was $568 million, a $186 million increase over the prior period. Excluding proceeds from sale and assets, free cash flow was $336 million, significantly more than the $175 million generated last year. Free cash flow conversion was 88%. Our commentary entering this year included an elevated level of cash tax payments based on the negative Section 174 impact. Based on legislative clarity and internal efforts, we were able to meaningfully lessen the impact. The net result was lower cash taxes equating to an approximate $29 million over-payment last fiscal year. Our consistent dedication to value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 20%. Additionally, I would highlight other notable return on capital metrics for the year, including $28 million share repurchases, more than offsetting annual dilution, $125 million in debt reduction, and $156 million in dividends. Heading into a new fiscal year, I will conclude with guidance. As you are aware, yesterday's press release included fiscal 2025 full year GAAP guidance, along with an enhanced transparency reconciliation to non-GAAP guidance metrics. While the press release also includes a fiscal '25 non-GAAP EPS metric, this is not intended to be a new guidance metric. The purpose is to provide additional clarity on our numbers, for example, current acquisition year-over-year comparison. And it should be noted that a 24% tax rate is used. Deconversion guidance will continue to follow the methodology introduced in fiscal '24 and, for fiscal '25, deconversion revenue guidance is $16 million. Full year GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance is 7% to 8%. Based on the above revenue growth that generate sustainable accretive sources of margin, we're guiding to an annual non-GAAP margin expansion of 25 basis points to 40 basis points. All of the above are aligned with our near-term targets as the business operates -- operations remain healthy and consistent. Full year tax rate estimate for fiscal '25 is 24%. The above guidance metric results in a full year guidance for GAAP EPS of $5.78 to $5.87 per share, a growth of 11% to 12%. Fiscal '23 has lower-than-expected free cash flow conversion due to a cash tax over-payment, which resulted in fiscal '24 having a better-than-expected conversion metric. Absent further legislative action, fiscal '25 will be a reversion to the expected trend line, resulting from the expiration of tax benefits in Section 174. As such, our full year expectation for free cash flow conversion is 65% to 75%. Our current view has the cadence of fiscal '25 non-GAAP revenue and margin increasing sequentially throughout the year. This increasing cadence will result in a strong second half that will be more pronounced than typical. Consequently, Q1 is expected -- expectation for non-GAAP revenue growth is approximately 5.25% and non-GAAP margin to contract approximately 100 bps. This is due to slower growth rates on on-premise annual maintenance and card processing. An additional factor is several long-term software usage contracts closing in Q1 of the prior year, which delivered significant allocation of license fees in that same quarter. The rest of the year improved strongly, with limited risk resulting in the full year guidance remaining consistent with our near-term targets. As a reminder, we see fluctuations in quarterly results relating to software usage license components, along with the timing of implementation. Therefore, the correct performance indicator for our business is the consistently strong fiscal year financial results. In conclusion, Q4 and full year results reflect strong performance and achievement of our targeted goals. We entered fiscal '25 with positive momentum and expect to drive impressive revenue growth and margin expansion. We remain exceptionally positive about demand for our solutions and the strength of our clients, resulting in superior shareholder value creation. We appreciate the contributions of our dedicated associates that drove these strong results and our investors for their ongoing confidence. Drew, please open the line for questions. Operator : Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Andrew Schmidt with Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Schmidt : Hi, Greg and Mimi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just to drill down on the fourth quarter core and complementary performance. And I know you're right, fiscal year metrics are the best way to look at the business, but was there anything for the fourth quarter that affected revenues there, timing shifts or perhaps the -- some of the things you called out for the fiscal first quarter that impacted results, or was it truly kind of tough comps? Thank you very much. Mimi Carsley : Good morning, Andrew. I appreciate the question. Although I would reiterate, just -- as you just mentioned, the importance of looking at our year -- on a year-long basis rather than the quarters. I don't see any trends that I think structurally will continue that we would call out. I think it was mostly just, you always have to look at what is the installation queue, what's going on, what's going on with that shift from on-premise to outsourcing. And so, I think it was just a matter of this quarter playing out in that pattern. Andrew Schmidt : Got it. Appreciate that. And then, maybe, I could ask a question on just the new wins side. Step-up in new core signed above $1 billion in assets is pretty bright spot. Obviously, there's multiple factors that drive that, but is it possible to spill that down? Is it products? Is it go-to-market focus? What's driving the move up market? I know that's been a theme in the past several years, but it seems like you're making faster progress towards -- shifting towards higher asset size institutions. So, I would love to get some more color there. Thank you very much. Greg Adelson : Sure. Andrew, this is Greg. So, yeah, thanks for the question. I think, as I tried to reference a little bit in the script, but more importantly, it is about our level of execution. We're hearing this on a regular basis, that I think, you know this and most people do that, we do provide to our clients what our roadmaps are, and we show what we're going to be doing and when we're going to be doing. And I think there's a level of trust and belief. And so, the more that we're executing, the more that our technology innovation is getting out there and they're seeing the results and it's providing a -- really an opportunity for us to get in front of these larger customers first of all. And then, second of all, as we mentioned, our associates and our client service reputation continues to truly shine, especially at a time when maybe it's not in the rest of the industry. So, those have been big. And then, I think, we've also hired some really good and talented sales individuals that have come with experience in selling into these larger institutions, and that's continued to help us as well. But I think it's a combination of all those things that are coming to fruition and allowing us to be successful. Andrew Schmidt : Got it. Thank you very much, Greg. Appreciate the comments. Greg Adelson : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from Vasu Govil with KBW. Please go ahead. Vasu Govil : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First one for you, Greg. Just as you've taken over the reins, any sort of strategic changes that you're envisioning for the company that the company might need? And where are you focusing more of your efforts at this point? Greg Adelson : Yeah. No, I mean, fortunately, I took over for an individual that did a pretty good job. So, not being significant. I mean, we've been able to really make a very -- what I would say, a very smooth transition. And so, we're focused on some things that I've talked about. Obviously, the execution of the tech modernization strategy and what we've been doing with One Jack Henry continues. I've talked a little bit, and we'll talk a lot more at the Investor Day about our SMB strategy and where we're going with that. So, there's a lot of excitement behind that, that will be unveiling. And then, there's a couple of things that we've talked around product rationalization and really looking at things primarily in the complementary group that maybe aren't growing at the same pace as the rest of our company or have the margins and looking at what we want to do with those particular things, a lot of them are very small, but again, just making sure we stay focused on the things that really do move the needle. But I wouldn't say anything else really outside of that and just staying true to who we are as a company and our leadership team. Vasu Govil : That's very helpful color. And then, a quick one for you, Mimi. Just on the payments segment, it was good to see the acceleration in revenue growth there. I know you called out fraud-related services. I guess just maybe if you could put a finer point on whether all of the acceleration was these value-added services, because I think the debit numbers we saw from Visa, MasterCard were pretty consistent sequentially? Mimi Carsley : Yeah. The payments segment had a 8.4% growth for Q4, and more importantly, the 6.7% growth for the full year. It was a big year for payments, especially given throughout the year some economic uncertainty around the strength of the US consumer. We're seeing the trends from that being in line with our expectations, still healthy, but not over exuberant from a spending perspective. The nice thing about our payments business, it's not just ours, we have other businesses. We have the EPS business, we have the PayCenter business, those are doing quite well. We're seeing a lot of demand, especially as the continuation of real-time payments excitement, the fraud solutions that are helping people feel more comfortable in going to these newer solutions. So, those two businesses are doing quite well from a processing, and the remit business overall has been healthy. Within card, as you mentioned, we do have a whole portfolio of complementary services that surround the card transaction and we're continuing to see nice demand for those services. So, that's really helping us from a total portfolio perspective. Vasu Govil : Thank you very much. Mimi Carsley : You're welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jason Kupferberg : Good morning, guys. I just wanted to start on the margin side. I know that you've comfortably beat your initial fiscal '24 guidance on the margin line. The initial fiscal '25 guide calls for less margin expansion than in 2024. So, is this reflective of some ongoing conservatism, or were there some transitory tailwinds last year you don't expect to recur? I know you're starting off the year down about 100 basis points in Q1, but just wanted to get a little bit of more color on the margin outlook, please. Mimi Carsley : I appreciate you bringing up that important point. Margin expansion is one of the key elements that we are focused on as a management team. We're quite disciplined as we think about the cost of the organization, and yet, building for a scale of future success. I would say there's a couple of things. I don't think it's an excessive conservatism. I think that's what we feel confident that the market and the model generate. But there are some headwinds as we leave FY '24 into '25 that helps us in '24, things like the slowing back-fills of the VEDIP departures, particularly that's part of the reason why you'll see the guide for Q1 a little bit weaker, is that really helped us in Q1 of FY '24, as well as we had a one-time shift in the timing of our annual merit increase cycle. So, those are some issues that create just kind of a grow-over challenge next year. But in general, we feel quite confident that the model continues to produce margin expansion at a nice clip. So, we're excited about the year guidance and we always aim and strive for more, but we want to put a number out there that we feel confident in our ability to deliver. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. That's helpful. Just a follow-up on the payments segment. I wanted to hone in on card production a little bit. I know on the issuer processing side, it sounds like things are pretty stable, but there had been some softness in card production earlier in the year. Did you see some reversal of that? What are you expecting for F '25 on the card production side? Mimi Carsley : Yeah. I think that was more of a one-time issue that we've worked through. It was not an issue in Q4. We don't expect it to be an issue going forward. It's resolved itself. Jason Kupferberg : Excellent. Thank you, Mimi. Mimi Carsley : You're welcome. Operator : The next question comes from John Davis with Raymond James. Please go ahead. John Davis : Hey, good morning, guys. Greg, I wanted to circle back to core wins. I think you called out 15 of greater than $1 billion in assets versus five just a year ago. Just curious where that stacks up historically? Has it always kind of been in the low- to mid-single-digits and now we had a big step up? And then, also you called out that your average client is larger today. Any context behind that, like, it's X percent bigger than it was five years ago, or any color to help us contextualize the kind of moving up-market? Greg Adelson : Yeah, for sure. So, I appreciate the question, JD. So, I'll start with your first one. So, yeah, 15 is by far a historical number for us. So, five last year was more on the average. So, we would typically be in the four to six ranges, something like that on an average year. So, 15 is a big step up for us. And again, I think, a lot of it is, what I had mentioned earlier on, I believe, it was Andrew's question, was around just kind of what we've been doing on our level of execution and showing the innovation that we have. I really truly believe that we are now viewed in the industry as the innovative leader, especially when it comes to core processors in this space. So, I think that has helped us a lot. To your second question, yeah, I think, I had referenced over four years, I can't tell you over five, but over four, we have grown our banking assets by 27% and our credit union assets by 34%, and those were over the last four years. So, that is an aggregation of a few things. One, the continued growth of our customers and what we've been able to do to help them grow deposit growth. Obviously, some things may have been helped through PPP at the time, but the reality is their assets continue to grow. Some of the products that we provide, Banno and products like that, definitely have a really big impact on deposit growth. And then, of course, some of it is the wins that we've had as well. John Davis : Okay. And that's super helpful. And then, Mimi, I want to drill in on free cash flow a little bit. Obviously, much better in the fourth quarter, I think, at least we expected and for the full year relative to your initial outlook. But if I adjust out the $29 million of over-payment in '23 that, I guess, you got back in '24, I still get free cash flow conversion around 80%. So, maybe just help me kind of walk from the 80% to the, call it, midpoint of 70% that you're talking about for we're expecting in fiscal '25? Mimi Carsley : Yeah, happy to, JD. Free cash flow is one of my favorite topics. So, let me give you a little bit more of the [walk color] (ph) there, because I think there's two major components. If you take the 88% that we just released for the full year, there's -- versus the prior year of 55%, there's two components that overstated the FY '24 conversion. One is, as we just talked about that $29 million of essentially an over-payment in FY '23 taxes. The other thing is the collection timing of our annual maintenance in this year. As you know, those invoices go out in the late spring, early summer, we start collecting on them in the June-July timeframe. And just depending on, in any given year, how many people pay them as soon as they get them versus in July, sometimes, in a given year, that shift, the timing of that collection impacting free cash flow. So, this year, I would say, there was probably about $60 million of timing collection related benefits to the free cash flow conversion in FY '24. So, if you adjust both of those, you're roughly talking probably a 65% free cash flow conversion, which is in line with where we think for FY '25, hopefully, a little better than that as we get in our guidance range, but that is the math. John Davis : Okay. No, very helpful. Thanks guys. Greg Adelson : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Will Nance : Hey, guys. Appreciate you taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up on the 1Q guidance and sort of the trajectory over the course of the year. I know there are some kind of seasonal impacts that typically hit the first quarter around the annual maintenance. I think you've kind of just touched on that. But I think you also referenced processing on the payments side. So, maybe, can you just drill down on sort of expectations, I guess, maybe stripping around -- stripping out the annual license impacts? What are the kind of embedded assumptions around the payments segment in 1Q? Should we expect that kind of the [8%] (ph) level to continue into next year? And then, maybe just talk about drivers of the acceleration over the course of the year outside of some of the annual fees that you've just hit on? Mimi Carsley : Yeah. Will, I appreciate the question. And I would say, this year, we gave probably a little bit more color than we had in past years, only because of the way we think the pattern will play out. We don't guide to a quarterly. We manage the business on an annual basis. But in an effort to make sure that people weren't surprised by the way that Q1 might play out, we wanted to give a little bit more specificity there. I think if you look at some of the drivers, yeah, we expect a modest Q1 from a payments perspective, but that's coming off the -- payments usually grows throughout the year. So, that's usually just your typical restart from an annual basis. The other thing to look at is, we have very strong first half in hardware this past year in FY '24. So, that from a -- just the nature of the cycle of hardware sales, our clients, the new hardware that comes out, we think that probably FY '25 may not be as robust as the very strong first half of FY '24. So, I think that's some of the things. And then, as you mentioned that very important software and usage contracts and particularly, the software licensing part of that. As we see more people overtime, those renewals and how that reseller works, last year, we just saw a wave of first half renewals, that we think the pattern this year will be a little less than the first half. So, we wanted to call that out. Will Nance : Yeah. That's all super helpful. And then, maybe just more big picture on the payments segment. Got a lot of questions on just what the building blocks for growth there, knowing that issuer processing is a big part of that business. There's been a lot of discussion around the kind of domestic debit transaction trends, kind of, more broadly and just what the growth algo is there. I guess, in a world where debit transactions are growing 6%, what is -- what do you see as kind of the most important driver for growing more in line with sort of how you frame the long-term targets in the segment? You called out enterprise payments, I believe, today. Just what in your mind are kind of the big building blocks to get to the segment targets there? Greg Adelson : Sure. Hey, Will, this is Greg. I'll take that one. So, I think there's a couple of things. I think EPS has -- there's some things that we're doing in that product base that could have some additional growth, but I think the most of it is going to come from really the other two payment groups. So as you know, what we're doing with our bill pay and turning that into more of a bill management solution with the Payrailz acquisition and what we've done to combine the back-end of the iPay solution, the very -- and the front-end of the Payrailz solution and kind of rolling that out and what we call Journey to One. And that will be -- it's continuing to get completed and executed on time. We'll have that done by the end of the fiscal year, but the reality is that we've already seen some nice uptake there with clients that are very interested in what we're doing and how we're going about that. And so, there's some opportunities there. And the other big one comes from the PayCenter application. And what we've done today on the receive side where we have roughly over 300 institutions on all three of those faster payment rails today, including the FedNow, and -- which is roughly about 40% of the RTP clients that are live and roughly about 30% of the FedNow clients. But we're working with our clients today because of the fraud modules that we've been able to create with Financial Crimes Defender, and I referenced a lot of those sales, we're working with our clients on the use cases to be able to do send. And once the send capabilities get out and we get some more leverage for that and some things to get changed, I think, with a few of the use cases in particular, I think there's some real upside in that particular group as well. So, as Mimi referenced, it isn't all about card. Obviously, card is the biggest driver, but there's a few of these of the ancillary solutions within payments that I think have some upside over the next couple of years. Will Nance : Got it. It's great color. Appreciate you taking the questions this morning. Greg Adelson : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Kennedy with William Blair. Please go ahead. Chris Kennedy : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Clearly, new sales activity has been very strong, but you're going with larger institutions. Is there any impact on kind of the timeline to implementation of some of these newer wins? Greg Adelson : No. Chris, I'll take that. This is Greg. So, no, I mean, typical -- and just as a reminder really for everybody that typically when we win these new core deals, it's usually a 12- to 18-month process. So, depending on who that institution is, really what the timeliness is of their existing contract, some clients like to get out ahead of their termination window, and so there's negotiation and things that take place, and then, there's a kind of a wait-and-see period for -- not wait and see, but wait period for that implementation. But we're still in that 12 to 18 month typical window for those implementations. So, really anything that we just sold those 22 aren't going to see -- for the most part, aren't going to see any real revenue for Jack Henry in this fiscal year. Obviously, the ones we sold last year, and Mimi referenced, an increasing opportunity for us in our quarters over time and some of that is a byproduct of the timing of some of those implementations. But we're not seeing anything today that has extended beyond what we had typically seen in the past. Chris Kennedy : Great. Thanks for that. And then, just a quick one on return on invested capital. Obviously, it's very high, but it has come down over the last couple of years. Any thoughts on kind of the long-term opportunity with that metric? Thank you. Mimi Carsley : Okay. Yeah, part of being a disciplined capital allocator, we're being really thoughtful around that. I think the ROIC, while 20% is an enviable number and something we're quite proud of, it has come down a little bit just based on the math of as we had to take on the debt for the Payrailz acquisition. We're now paying that down. We paid down that substantially this past year. So, as we continue to pay down the debt and have the flexibility to do more in the form of repurchases or more in the form of other activities, that will drive ROIC. So, it's just the very tail end of working through that process. So, we expect that to continue on a positive trend and an upward trend. Chris Kennedy : Great. Thank you. Mimi Carsley : You're welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Kartik Mehta : Hey, good morning, Greg. Greg, I wanted to just get your perspective on the core business. I know the focus should be the year, but after saying that I'm going to talk about the quarter, so I apologize for that. Fourth quarter maybe a little bit lower than expectation. But I'm wondering, as you look at FY '25, considering all the core wins you've had, is that a business that you think segment that continues to grow kind of in line with the overall revenue growth of the company? Greg Adelson : Yeah. Hey, Kartik. Yeah, thanks for the question. For sure, I mean, I think as we have articulated throughout, I mean, it is a full year business for us and how we manage the business. It was a little tougher comp from last year compared to this particular one. But there is no concern on what we're doing, where we're going with that particular business. And so, the significance of the core wins, the significance of the products that we're bringing in there, the significance of what we're doing in technology modernization in general. So, I mean, the short answer to your question, Kartik, is, it just is a full year game for us. That's really what it is. Mimi Carsley : And Kartik, this is Mimi. If I could just add on, the tremendous fourth quarter that Greg talked about the [indiscernible] for the sales, I mean, that's at the very end of our year. So, if you think about that cycle for readiness for implementation on the client side, when you'll start to see that revenue, is not in FY '25 picture for the core. Kartik Mehta : Makes sense. And then, just on pricing, I know this is always a competitive industry and whenever you have renewals, pricing gets competitive. But just in general, any change in the environment in the last three, six months that you've noticed? Greg Adelson : I'll take that. Yeah, I mean, not necessarily. I think our competition has continued to kind of do what they typically do and kind of how they go to battle. And so, we haven't seen anything significantly change there. Some of their stories are changing and some of their approaches are changing, but in reality, it is really about what have you done for me. And so, as you can imagine, in 22 competitive core wins, a lot of those came from the normal players out there that you would know. And so, it's really about our ability to execute, our ability to service our reputation for doing that, our consistency of how we go about things, the consistency of our team. Our turnover rates is very low at the company, and so you just get a consistency with that. So again, the short answer for you, Kartik, is I don't feel that there's anything significantly changing out in the marketplace other than some of the stories that go with it. Kartik Mehta : Perfect. Thank you both. I really appreciate it. Greg Adelson : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Peter Heckmann : Hey, good morning. Wanted to follow-up on Banno a little bit and just see -- I mean 927 on Banno Retail I think you said, that's really impressive. And can you talk about how many clients you still might have on NetTeller or maybe your mobile digital banking product? And how do you think about the growth of Banno once you substantially upgraded most of your clients from the older systems? Greg Adelson : Yes, it's a great question, Pete. So, not to get in the minutiae, but just 924, just want to make sure we have our numbers right. So, 924, and so that continues to be a huge opportunity for us, and there's a lot of runway still in the credit union space, right, so -- and the banking space, but really in the credit union space where we have been attacking that part of our core business. So, there's still a lot of upside. When you think about that we have roughly 1,700 core clients, so there's still a lot of runway within our own base. But of course, we're working on outside the base strategy as well. And so, we're working with some of our competitors to get what we need to make that successful, sometimes not as easy as we had hoped, to make that happen. But the reality is we're making a lot of progress and we still expect to do what we said we were going to do, which is get that out the latter part of this fiscal year or the second half of the calendar year. So that's still on point. To answer your question around NetTeller, I don't know exactly, but it's roughly a couple of hundred left on the NetTeller platform. Peter Heckmann : Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just in terms of M&A, clearly the pace of M&A has slowed. And just curious like how much of that is Jack Henry's suite of solutions is largely filled out and there's no longer any holes, but are there other effects to the extent that like the industry is less fragmented, there's not as many small players or valuation? How are all those playing into the outlook for M&A? Greg Adelson : Yeah, I think you hit on all of them. I think it is a combination of much of what you described. We continue to look at opportunities that make sense. The difference is that really our approach hasn't changed, just what we're looking for has changed. So, when you think about our tech modernization strategy, we're really looking first and foremost at what is already public cloud native, and so we don't have to rewrite the technology once an acquisition takes place. Obviously, Payrailz was one of those examples where it was already public cloud native. Looking to your point about gaps, we don't have the gaps that we had many years ago. And again, maybe the opposite of where we want to focus, which is about that product rationalization, where we're looking at things that just don't make sense as they once did maybe 10 years ago, and so we're looking at that. But I think when you look at the opportunities in front of us, public cloud native, number one. Number two is, do they help us accelerate some of the things that we're looking at in payments or in the SMB strategy that we'll be talking about more, or in some of the things that we're doing to roll out in our -- I would say, the key products of digital enterprise account opening fraud, things along with that line. Those are really where our focus would be. Peter Heckmann : Okay. Good stuff. I'll look forward to seeing you in a few weeks. Greg Adelson : Okay. Thanks, Pete. Operator : The next question comes from Charles Nabhan with Stephens. Please go ahead. Charles Nabhan : Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. You had mentioned that roughly 73% of your clients are now in the public cloud. I think that's up from 69% at the Investor Day last year. My question is how much runway is left to move your client base to the cloud? And if you could talk about what that could mean for revenue uplift? I think you had cited 2 times revenue uplift in the past from additional cross-sell as well as some margin benefits as well. Any commentary around that would be helpful. Greg Adelson : Sure, Chuck. I'll take it. Mimi can add some commentary. Yeah, I think -- so it is up from where we were. I don't know if I remember it was 69%, but definitely up from where we are. So roughly, we don't expect to get 100% of movement there. I would say that the 93%, 95% range is probably a reasonable number for us to think through. The other thing is that as we've kind of moved and as we've moved to the type of clients that are left in there, which tend to be a lot of the larger ones, that number actually has kind of gone down. So, it's more about 1.75% now than it was at the 2% through the years. And so, still significant, but down a little bit. But we're continuing to stay focused. We still have several years of runway on that. So, if you think about it, there's a couple of hundred left really on each side. And so, if you're averaging somewhere between 40 and 45 a year, you got three, four, five years left based on that to get kind of to our numbers. But that will continue to be a focus and an opportunity. And I think there'll be other opportunities to move from the private cloud to the public cloud over time, too. So, we can't just focus only on what will be moving to the private cloud, because at the same time, we're winding that down, we'll have opportunities to move customers from the private cloud to the public cloud around the same timeframe. Charles Nabhan : Got it. I'm sorry if I cut you off, but my follow-up was around -- sort of a follow-up to Kartik's question around segment outlook. If I compare fiscal year '24 results to your normalized guide, it looks like core came in a little ahead, whereas complementary and payments were a little below the normalized guide. And just putting aside quarterly cadence, I know you had cited some softness in maintenance, which I think flows through core. Could we expect more of a normalized annual cadence of revenue growth next year, more with core coming in the 6% to 7% range and payments and complementary in the 8% to 9% range? Mimi Carsley : Yeah. Chuck, this is Mimi. I think our intention for the growth algorithm is to have an indicator, it's not a precision. And so, I do think the nice -- the beauty of it is we have a whole portfolio. And so, sometimes they counterbalance each other, in different ways. So, the great year -- this year, core had higher than the growth algorithm, right? That's somewhat compensated for the lower complementary. Payments, you have the question of what happens with the economy and geopolitical and election and a lot of other issues. So, I think in general, we still expect that the growth algorithm holds, but it's illustrative on like any given year, they could plus and minus a little bit and offset each other. Charles Nabhan : Got it. Thank you. Mimi Carsley : You're welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead. Dave Koning : Yeah. Hey, thanks guys. And I guess my question is a little similar just on what normalized growth is. I guess, if Q1 is 5.25%, the rest of the year has to average around 8.25% to hit the midpoint of the range. And I guess that's a little above normal. And I guess are any segments going to outsize kind of accelerate from Q1? Or is it really just getting all segments in that 8% range kind of the rest of the year? Mimi Carsley : Yeah, Dave, I would say, in general, we're not going to give color quarter by quarter at this point as we live into the year. We think that we want to call out something a trend we're seeing. We'll certainly be transparent on that. I agree with your math that we expect it to sequentially grow throughout the year, with second half being stronger than the first half. So, I think, Q1 is more pronounced. That's why we gave the color with more specificity. But I would say Q2 overall is going to be a higher growth than Q1. And I think that is pretty fair to say across the board, across all of the segments. Dave Koning : Yeah. Okay. Thank you. And maybe one just -- I guess one follow-up question. Net interest income, if we look at the interest income less interest expense, was a positive $5 million or so in the quarter. It was better than it's been in a while. But you have a net debt position. So, I'm wondering how you get a pretty sizable net interest income when you have a debt position and if that's sustainable? Mimi Carsley : Good question, Dave. So, how we get that interest income and the impact it has on net interest, as you did call out, we do have the debt. We've been paying it down pretty significantly this year in a paydown, and we expect that to continue for '25. But we do have -- we administer cash settlement balances and as part of that administrative services, we get some of the revenue from those cash settlement accounts. Through negotiations we've had with partners and the like, we've been able to increase the yield in those accounts. Now that does have some correlation to interest rate environment, so depending on what the Fed does in '25, but overall, I would say that it's sustainable. It is subject to some interest rate sensitivity, but it is sustainable. Dave Koning : Got you. Thanks, guys. Mimi Carsley : Happy to. Greg Adelson : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette : Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time this morning. Wanted to just ask a quick follow-up question on a couple of points. First, on your customers and their priorities, given where we are in the deposit cycle and the prospect of a return to loan growth next year with lower interest rates et cetera, how have you seen if at all your customers change prioritization in terms of where they're looking to invest between deposit attraction and retention tools versus lending? Are we seeing any change in your customers' focus and priorities right now? Greg Adelson : Yeah, that's a great question, James. And so, I have a couple of different reference points for you, too. So, I know Northcoast Research did their own survey, and then, of course, we do our annual benchmark survey that we have. Both of them kind of showed the priorities being fairly the same as far as deposit growth being number one. The one thing that I will reference from our benchmark survey is this, which is that, in 2023, growing deposits was 43%, it's still number one, but 43% of the CEO has named that as their number one. This year, it was 54%. So, significant growth in both of those numbers, but again, same as a priority. The other two, just since you asked, have really kind of stayed fairly consistent, which is improving operational efficiency and growing loans, but both of those have gone up slightly from 2023 to 2024. But again, those are typically the top three. And you can throw fraud as a really close number four for priorities. James Faucette : Great. Appreciate that. And, Greg, I wanted to follow-up on a comment you made in terms of implementation queues and how -- wondering how those are trending broadly. And how are you thinking about the puts and takes between the margin expansion you're delivering right now versus potential for additional resource allocation to speed up those implementations broadly? Greg Adelson : No, it's a great question, one that we address on a regular basis with our team. So, we do -- we work through that on a regular basis. So, there's a lot of short business cases that we do. But the reality is if we can implement the revenue faster, we absolutely find ways to do that. Sometimes it is a reflection on the actual product, sometimes it's a reflection of the complementary or payment product that was sold with the core. And so, sometimes those don't get implemented until the core is implemented. So, you have some of those timing delays. Core, in particular, is, as I described, it's a 12- to 18-month process most times, maybe a little longer on a couple, but most of the time than that. But for our other products, so let's just take Financial Crimes Defender, we've already increased our resources on that this year to kind of work through our installation queues and get that down into smaller numbers to ensure that we continue to keep our customers happy. James Faucette : That's great. Thank you so much. Greg Adelson : Sure. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vance Sherard for any closing remarks. Vance Sherard : Thank you, Drew. Please don't forget that our Investor Day is fast approaching. It will take place on Thursday, September 5th in Dallas starting at 1 :00 pm Central Time. You can join us via webcast.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vance Sherard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Vance Sherard : Thank you, Viate. Good morning, and thank you for joining the Jack Henry first quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call. Today, I'm joined by President and CEO, Greg Adelson; and CFO and Treasurer, Mimi Carsley. Following my opening remarks, Greg will share his insights on the first quarter of our fiscal year and provide observations on our business and the industry. Mimi will then discuss the financial results and full year guidance outlined in yesterday's press release, which is available in the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website. Afterwards, we will open the lines for a Q&A session. Please note that this call includes forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. The Company is not obligated to update or revise these statements. For a summary of risk factors and additional information that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements refer to yesterday's press release and the Risk Factors and forward-looking statements sections in our 10-K. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures such as non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. Reconciliations for these measures are included in yesterday's press release. Now, I will hand the call over to Greg. Greg Adelson : Thank you, Vance. Good morning, and I appreciate each of you joining this morning's call. I'm pleased to report overall solid financial performance results in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2025. I'd like to begin by thanking our associates for their hard work and commitment to our success by doing whatever it takes in doing the right thing for our clients. As I introduced in my script last quarter, I will share three main takeaways from the quarter and then we'll provide additional detail about our overall business. First, our financial performance. We exceeded our first quarter outlook. We had non-GAAP revenue growth of 5.3% in Q1 slightly ahead of the 5.25% anticipated in August. As we indicated in August, Q1 revenue and margins were impacted by slower growth rates for on-premise annual maintenance and card processing. Additionally, several long-term software usage contracts closed in Q1 of last year, creating a difficult comparison for this quarter. We remain confident in our full year non-GAAP revenue guidance of 7% to 8%. We provided commentary in August that non-GAAP margin would see contraction of 100 basis points. We ended the quarter with only 89 basis points of contraction. Second. Our sales performance. After a record Q4 for our sales team, we continued the positive momentum with record sales attainment in Q1 that included six competitive core wins. Of the six, three were financial institutions with over $1 billion in assets, including one $7 billion asset win. We also closed six deals to move existing clients from in-house processing to our private cloud. Third. Our client conference. We had a very successful Jack Henry Connect conference last month in Phoenix with nearly 2,600 clients and prospects in attendance. This is our largest conference of the year and produces a significant number of sales leads. Last year, 17 of our new core wins were from prospects that attended the conference. Now for more detail on our overall business. During the quarter, we were proud to be included in several national Best Places to Work ring. We placed 16th in News Week list of top 200 most loved workplaces, marking our third consecutive year ranked in the top 20. We also made News Week's Most Admired Workplaces list, earning five stars, which is the highest possible rating. Additionally, we ranked number 11 in IDC's 2024 FinTech rankings based on annual revenue, representing our 16th consecutive year on that list. We are honored to receive these national recognitions as they reflect our people-first culture, commitment to exceptional service and success in delivering innovative technology that empowers community and regional financial institutions. Our Payments segment continued to perform well. We signed four new debit processing clients and three new credit clients in the quarter. We now have 324 clients on the Zelle platform, 326 clients using RTP, representing approximately 43% of the live RTP clients and 290 clients using FedNow representing approximately 36% of the live FedNow clients. In our Complementary segment, we signed seven new Financial Crimes Defender contracts in the quarter. In addition, we signed 26 new contracts for the Financial Crimes Defender faster payment fraud module, a real-time solution designed to help mitigate fraud in Zelle, FedNow and RTP transactions. We have installed 83 Financial Crimes Defender customers and have another 94 in various stages of implementation. We also have 37 faster payment modules installed and 133 in various stages of implementation. Continuing with our Complementary segment, we continue to see strong success with our Banno digital solution. For the quarter, we signed 12 new clients to the Banno retail platform as well as 18 new Banno Business deals. We currently have more than 950 Banno retail clients with over 180 live with Banno Business. We finished the quarter with 12.7 million registered users on the Banno platform. At the end of Q1 last year, we had 10.5 million registered users, a 20% increase over the past 12 months. Each year, we sponsored two technology surveys. We can tuck the Jack Henry strategy benchmark in mid-January through early February, and this only goes to Jack Henry clients. We also co-sponsored a survey with Bank Director and the results from their mid-June to early July technology prioritization and spending questions were published in September. In the Bank Director survey, 75% of the respondents reported an increase in their bank technologies budget for fiscal year 2024. Their top technology objectives are to improve operational efficiency, attract and retain customers and increase deposits. Those results are consistent with findings from our strategy benchmark published last spring. In that survey, 80% of our own clients said they plan to increase technology spending over the next two years with their top priorities being growing deposits, increasing operational efficiency and growing loans. Although the two surveys were conducted six months apart, they yield very similar results around planned technology spending and key priorities. As I mentioned earlier, Jack Henry Connect was a tremendous success that we received rave reviews from our clients, prospects and industry consultants that attended the event. Along with the more than 2,400 clients in attendance, we hosted 130 prospect attendees from 50 financial institutions. Our technology showcase included 250 third-party fintech with most being competitors which underscores our philosophy to be in an open technology provider. Our vendor exit survey indicated 99% of these fintechs want to exhibit again at our conference in 2025. The conference agenda was robust and anchored by the significant progress we made on our technology modernization initiative. We continue to execute the strategy of breaking out key components of the core and building them on a cloud-native API-first platform, The Jack Henry platform. We are live with domestic wires, international wires, data broker and entitlement. We are in beta testing with both exception processing and general ledger. We remain on track to deliver a digital retail and commercial deposit only core during calendar year 2026. I will continue to provide more details on our progress throughout the year. As we've done in prior years at the Jack Henry Connect, we held our annual CEO forum, which was attended by 185 CEOs, a new record for us. The general feedback throughout the meeting suggested that attendees are less concerned about the overall economy in the last year, and they continue to invest in technology to enhance digital capabilities, improve efficiencies and modernize their businesses. The CEO agenda was well received by both clients and prospects, included the demonstration of our recently announced SMB solution with Moov. As mentioned at Investor Day, we remain on track to deliver this unique solution to Banno early adopter clients in May of 2025. This solution will be sold through our bank and credit use to capture more and higher-value deposits while positioning the financial institution at the center of the relationship with their SMB customers. The SMB will benefit from eight daily settlement windows, tap to pay capabilities for both iOS and Android devices, one-click enrollment and approval and continuous accounting reconciliation. In closing, we hold our Annual Shareholder Meeting next week in Monett, Missouri. We will also offer a webcast viewing option for observers to watch remotely. I remain extremely optimistic about the demand environment based on the recent surveys I referenced in our pipeline returning to an all-time time. Furthermore, we continue to hear positive feedback from our clients, prospects and industry consultants regarding our key differentiation -- differentiators of culture, exceptional service and innovative technology. These strengths, along with our proven track record of execution, will continue to drive positive results and position us well for the future. With that, I'll turn it over to Mimi for more specifics on our financials. Mimi Carsley : Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Our continued focus on culture, service and innovation while supporting our community and regional financial institution clients led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth and a healthy start to our fiscal year. I will cover the details behind our first quarter results and then conclude with commentary on the second quarter outlook and our fiscal '25 guidance. Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP revenue increased 5%, consistent with our expectations and providing the base for achieving our full year guidance. Quarterly deconversion revenue of approximately $4 million, which we released prior to full earnings was largely flat with the same period last year, reflecting minimal consolidation of our clients. This is also consistent with our expectations. Now taking a closer look at the details. GAAP and non-GAAP services and support revenue increased 4%. Data processing and hosting continue to be significant drivers of services and support revenue growth. Lower license and hardware revenues compared with prior year moderated services and support revenue. Our private and public cloud offerings increased over 11% in the quarter, reflecting strong persistence growth. This reoccurring revenue contributor is 30% of our total revenue and have long been a key double-digit growth engine. Shifting to processing revenue, which is 41% of total revenue and another significant contributor for our long-term growth model. We saw strong performance with 7% growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter. Continuing long-term trend, quarterly drivers include increased cards, digital and payment processing revenue. Completing commentary on revenue, I would highlight quarterly total reoccurring revenue was 93%. Quarterly enterprise fee revenue was 71% of total revenue and grew at 9%. Excluding hardware non-key revenue grew 1%. Next, moving to expenses. Beginning with the cost of revenue, which increased 6% on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter. Drivers for the quarter included higher direct costs, increased personnel drop, internal license and amortization. For clarification and to assist with models, the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was $6 million for the quarter. Next, R&D expense increased 8% on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter. The quarterly increase was primarily related to personnel costs. Ending with SG&A expense for the quarter on a GAAP basis decreased over 15% versus prior year related to last year's onetime needed cost. SG&A increased 7% on a non-GAAP basis. We remain focused on generating annually compounding margin expansion. While the quarter results delivered an 89-basis point decrease in non-GAAP margins to 25%, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year margin expansion consistent with our full year guidance. These solid quarterly results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.63, up 17%. This was partially driven by the expense in Q1 of fiscal '24 that were nonrecurring. Reviewing the three operating segments. We are pleased by positive performance across the board. Our Core segment revenue increased 5% for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis against a tough comp. Forth segment, key revenue was 62% of total segment quarterly revenue with tremendous growth of 12%. Non-key revenues, primarily on-premise annual maintenance decreased 4%. Non-GAAP operating margin decreased 84 basis points. Margins were impacted by software usage and headcount associated with the implementation. Payments segment quarterly revenue increased 6% on a non-GAAP basis. The segment again had impressive non-GAAP operating margin growth of 103 basis points. Revenue growth was due to continued growth in our card-related risk management solutions and strong growth from faster payments. Margins benefited from lower cost of revenue and card network incentives. Finally, complementary segment. Quarterly non-GAAP revenue growth increased 7% from a strong product mix with hosting and digital being a consistent store. Segment margin contracted 45 basis points, primarily due to amortization, licensee fees and direct support costs, partially offset by the growth in hosting and digital revenue. Now let's turn to a review of cash flow and capital allocation. First quarter operating cash flow was $117 million, a $40 million decrease over the prior period, reflecting a timing shift, higher annual maintenance collections in Q4 last year than the historical norm. Trailing 12 months free cash flow was $289 million, resulting in a 72% conversion. Our consistent dedication to value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 20%. Heading into the second quarter, I will conclude with comments on quarterly cadence and full year guidance metrics. As you're aware, yesterday's press release included fiscal 2025 full year GAAP guidance along with a reconciliation to our non-GAAP guidance metrics, all of which are reiterated. While the press release also included a fiscal '25 non-GAAP EPS metrics, this is not intended to be a new guidance center. The purpose is to provide additional clarity on our numbers, and it should be noted that a 24% tax rate is used. All of the current fiscal year guidance metrics are in line with our near-term target as the business operations remains healthy and consistent. Our outlook for financial performance remains upbeat with the pace of fiscal 2025 non-GAAP revenue margin on track to increase sequentially throughout the year. This accelerating cadence will result in a strong second half that will be more pronounced and difficult. Consequently, Q2 expectations for non-GAAP revenue growth is approximately 6% with non-GAAP margins flat to slightly down. The rest of the year is expected to improve strongly, resulting in a full year guidance remaining consistent with our longer-term target. As a reminder, we see fluctuations in quarterly results relating to software's usage license component along with the timing of implementation. Therefore, the correct indicator of our business is the consistently strong fiscal year financial results. In conclusion, Q1 was consistent with our expectations and sets us up to achieve a full year that is consistent with our stated long-term targets. We remain focused on delivering long-term profitable growth at scale through compounding revenue growth and margin expansion. We appreciate the efforts of our more than 7,100 dedicated associates that drove these strong results and our investors for their ongoing confidence. Viate, will you please open the line for questions? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Andrew Schmidt with Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Schmidt : If I could just drill down on the core revenue growth for a moment. Maybe just unpack the first quarter performance a little bit. I know you managed for the full year, so I don't want to get too caught up on the first quarter performance. But maybe just a little -- few more details on how core performed in the first quarter? And then as the year progresses, can you talk about the trajectory we should expect there and the drivers as the year progresses? Greg Adelson : So, I'll start off with the Core attainment because that could be a combination of what you're doing, and I'll let Mimi talk about the specifics on the revenue. So, six core wins. I will tell you that there were a couple of pushes that we had due to the hurricane and -- or the hurricanes that happened. And we had a few deals that we anticipated that would have closed in the first quarter that got pushed to the second quarter. So, we didn't lose them. They just were timing. And obviously, we're not going to push people to try to sign a contract during those type of challenges. So that's part of it. But honestly, the exciting part that we highlighted was that we continue to win the multibillion-dollar opportunities, including the $7 billion. And we have several others that we expect to come here in the fruition as well. So that part of -- I think, the potential part of your question is on the sales side, and I'll let Mimi handle the revenue component. Mimi Carsley : So as Greg alluded just now, demand remains strongly intact and solid and you should expect that as the year goes on across all of the segments in particularly to your question around Core, we're going to continue to see the key growth strong with installation of prior year sales. And so, we expect, similar to how you called it out in your note that Q1 will be floor for revenue growth with the subsequent acceleration as the year progresses. So, nothing particular to call out from a cadence perspective. I just think you're going to see a very strong second half. Greg Adelson : Yes. And I think one other point, Andrew, and really for everybody else is I think it does point out that we still had a record quarter. So, if you look at our complementary products and the things that we're doing tangentially to just core wins, having a record quarter even with six core wins, which, again, we typically have a Q1 is typically light for us anyway coming off of the 20-or-so that we won in Q4 of last year. But the reality is, it really was pushes that happened from the hurricane or it would have been a fairly normal first quarter. Andrew Schmidt : Got it. Yes, that makes sense. It's good to see the balance in the bookings there with the record sales quarter. Maybe just in the wake of the election, could you just remind us how Jack Henry is impacted by consolidation from an underlying revenue growth perspective? And then whether this cycle -- obviously, it's very early, but whether this cycle should be any different than what we've seen historically? Greg Adelson : So again, I'll start, Mimi can add on. I think there's a couple of things. So, one, what is baked into '25, I don't think the election results will change much of what we have baked for '25. Knowing, obviously, we have a President that we've seen before. So, we know a little bit more of his playbook and what we should expect related to regulatory, hopefully, some improvement in the timing of M&A. But for our institutions we do have several already lined up with acquisitions that will be happening in the second half of our year and '25 that are already baked into the number. If something else accelerates, then obviously, that would be additional gravy for us. But we've already added, and I think we mentioned this on the last call, we've already added additional conversion teams and migration teams for both banking and credit union based on the feedback that we've gotten from our clients. And of course, we get knowledge of deals that are going to happen very early on so they can't get those slots. And so, we're working through that. But we'll see what happens. I think the regulatory challenges that we see today, hopefully, there's some lessening of that. And then obviously, the approach that they've taken in the past regime on really slowing down M&A and the timing of getting approvals, we would hope and expect that, that would enhance. And again, the more we're winning and the more we're growing asset sizes with our own institutions, which we've been articulating the 27% bank growth over the last four years and 34% credit union growth over the last four years, that continues to position us and more of the drivers in a lot of these opportunities. Mimi Carsley : Yes. I think spot on, Greg. The only thing I would add is given last year and the guidance for this year for deconversion revenue, it's hard to imagine that essentially next year, you don't see the impact to M&A leading to higher deconversion revenue. But again, as we said, you never know, that's really hard to forecast. And it really depends on the institution and where they are on their renewal cycle. But I would not bake in anything else for this year given the timing of the turnover of the new administration. Operator : Next question comes from Vasu Govil with KBW. Please go ahead. Vasu Govil : I guess first one for you, Greg. I wanted to ask about the Banno retail win. I think you said 12 new wins in the quarter, which is a good number, but if I look back, it's probably one of the slowest we've seen in the last several quarters. Just anything to call out there, anything timing related like you talked about the core? And then I know you have identified third-party cores also to sell Banno into? Just how is that effort going and any color around that? Greg Adelson : Yes. Good question. So, on the number of wins, I don't -- there's nothing -- no concern there. I think a lot of it is timing. A lot of Banno deals are tied, at this point in time to Core wins. We're still moving customers over from the old platform, and we're actually getting ready to announce. We've told our customers that we'll be announcing a sunsetting the NetTeller platform, which again will help accelerate some additional ones that have kind of been laggard to move. But the reality is, no concern there at all. And to get 18 Banno Business is very much in line with what we had last year. And fourth quarter, you really -- that hopefully is a heavy sales win for us. But comparing it to the Q1 of last year, we were fairly much in line with that particular quarter. Related to the outside of the base. So, this really mostly applies to the Banno than it does to some of our other products that we're taking outside the base. But honestly, we've had some challenges with some of our competitors being as open as they say they are. And so, we've been trying to work through some of the timing and costs that they want to embark upon us. And honestly, as a byproduct to that, we have really looked at a different way of approaching this. And I don't necessarily want to share what we're doing because I don't want it to get out to our competitors, but it is a way for us to bypass some of the typical integration points that you have to have and do it a different way, and we're working that path parallel. And it's really more appropriate and applicable to the Banno platform. The Banno platform has a lot more API integrations that need to happen, which makes it more difficult for some of those integration work. So, what we're going to do is be able to leverage some of the things that we're doing in Moov and be able to offer that through a process that will allow us to get outside the base, and we're going to do that in parallel with what we're doing with the other outside of the base initiatives. So, no change at this point in time line, just a little bit of a change in probably the level of productivity and success that we had hoped to have in -- by the end of this fiscal year. So more to come on that, but we are taking a different approach and I think it's going to be more successful for us. Vasu Govil : Great. And a quick one for you, Mimi. Just on the free cash flow conversion, like anything -- any change to the 65% guide that you had given us last quarter? Just any puts and takes there? Mimi Carsley : So, I feel comfortable with the guide remaining intact at the 65 to 75. There were a couple of people that noted Q1 a 50% cash flow. And I would just remind everyone that the annual, the trailing 12 months is a better indicator of the free cash flow because there are times, particularly Q4 to Q1, and the timing of the payments related to the annual maintenance. And as I called out on last quarter's call, Q4 benefited about $60 million from a higher mix being paid in Q4 to this Q1. So, if you think about that Q1 50%, it really is closer to the 100% like we've seen in prior year Q1. But I think the 72% should give everyone comfort that we are well within that guide -- full year guidance range. Operator : The next question comes from Rayna Kumar with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Rayna Kumar : So, one of your competitors recently called out a competitive win of less than $10 billion asset bank. I'm just wondering, if you're seeing any increased competition for banks and credit unions in core processing in your focus area? Greg Adelson : No. I mean, Rayna as said, we compete with -- we've always competed with that particular company in that space, and they -- we don't win them all. We win a lot and a lot more than anybody else, but we sure don't win them all. But from a standpoint of competitive pressure, no. That particular deal, I kind of know what happened. And there was a significant difference in price, for sure, but the reality is, we're continuing to be very successful in that space, including, like I said, the $7 billion opportunity we just won, plus a lot of the renewals that we've been able to do over the last 18 months are all at our larger client bases. So, it's anywhere from the 15 to the 30 that we've been renewing they're all staying with Jack Henry. So, there's no concerns at this point. Rayna Kumar : Understood. That's very helpful. The economy seems to be showing more resilience evidenced by recent earnings reports from other payment companies. Do you think if this macro environment persists, there could be upside to your 25 to 40 basis point margin expansion target for this fiscal year? Mimi Carsley : Yes. I think at this point, it's probably a little too early to say for us because we're just closing our first quarter. We do already have a pretty substantial second half planned that reflects robust growth. But yes, particularly in the area of transaction and card volumes, we anticipate a growing spending in the spring, but there is always an upside the economy and consumer sentiment is stronger. Operator : The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jason Kupferberg : I just wanted to start on the second half revenue growth outlook and definitely appreciate the priority on Q2 to get our models tuned. I guess you got to be at around 9% in the second half to get to the with midpoint of the full year and you talked about implementation cadence. But can you maybe just go a layer deeper into the visibility you have, factors that are going to drive that acceleration and just clarify which revenue lines that's going to be most pronounced in? It sounds like a lot of it is Core, but just wanted to check in on that. Mimi Carsley : Great question, Jason. Let me give you a little bit more color on some of the drivers that make us feel quite confident for the second half of the year. So first, I would call out the Hardware last year was quite strong. That a harder comp in first half this year than second half. So, the first half this year Hardware is about a $7 million drag impact that eases up a little bit in the second half of the year. We expect cloud revenue, the record growth to continue. The impact is of new sales impact. We see strong growth in the faster payment transaction and we're starting to see [indiscernible]. So, I think that's another opportunity in the second half. Card is I just said we expect this spring to pick up a little bit, and we do have a lower Q4 comp. And then I think just as new products continue to ramp, things like Defender accelerating, we're running implementations, consulting revenue transaction and then overall digital adoption tied to the F&B strategy. So, the impact of all that plus the implementation for all the prior year sales success coming on board gives us confidence in the second half. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. And just talking about Core wins for a second. I think you mentioned six in the quarter. I know it's a typical year, you target 50 to 55. It's still early. We know this is never ratable. It's usually lumpy by quarter. And I think you said a couple of deals slipped because of the hurricanes, but I wanted to just check in on overall pipeline confidence and visibility. And the 50 to 55 is still a reasonable ZIP code for this fiscal year based on how you see the pipeline converting over the next few quarters? Greg Adelson : It is. And again, we're still -- we're tracking well. Last year, we did the 15, more than $1 billion. And we're tracking again nice with that. We're already having three in the first quarter, which again is typically a lighter quarter for us. And not just a $1 billion deal, it's -- one of them was a $7 billion deal. So absolutely on track and the pipeline is as robust as it's ever been. It's at an all-time high again even after the record Q4 and year and record Q1. So, feel very confident in the team's ability to go hit our normal numbers. Operator : The next question comes from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Will Nance : Just another one on the second half acceleration. It's nice to hear the confidence there. And I just -- it sounds like most of that is more kind of implementation and tough comps from the prior year. Maybe there's a little bit easier of a comp in in payments in the back half of the year. But I guess, big picture, when you think about exiting the year at a stronger growth rate, maybe excluding having an easier comp in payments, is there anything in that back half growth rate you would caution us against run rating into the first half of the following year, not exactly asking for following your guidance, but just wanting to kind of understand if they feel like that's a good run rate given the implementation schedule for the following few quarters? Mimi Carsley : I appreciate your question, Will. I would say FY '26 is a little bit far away to give a cadence deal yet. And as we said, I wouldn't recommend taking any one quarter and annualizing that. So, I think as we get a little closer, we'll certainly get a feel. But I think there are some things with new products, the sales implementation, faster payment adoption, cloud growth that are a continuation and not just kind of a onetime like some of the grow over ease it will be. Greg Adelson : Yes. And the only thing I'll add to that, Will, is just much as we described at the Investor Day, our goal is to continue to inch up to the levels of closer to the 8% were all the things we're doing, we're hoping and believing that, that is going to get us there. But the move piece will just have been launched at the end of the year and seeing the level of success there, much as Mimi said, with a lot of the new products and continued implementations and getting through some of the queues that we have. And obviously, even in some of the things that we've been able to get launched in tech modernization, things around data broker and all that. So much time still needs to take place before we feel confident with giving you any more additional guidance. But the reality is we have all the things in motion, and we do have an all-time sales pipeline to go make it happen. Will Nance : Got it. Okay. I appreciate that. I figured I would ask. And then just I guess any color on just how you're thinking about capital allocation and the M&A environment? We touched a little bit on bank M&A, but just any kind of capital allocation priorities come to mind and what might be an environment that's more conducive to M&A? Mimi Carsley : Yes. I would say we're steadfast in our prioritization from a capital allocation perspective, we're continuing to invest in our future growth through innovation. We continue to support our long-standing dividend policy. We paid down the debt. We're continuing to pay down the debt throughout the year. And as we start to build into a more positive cash flow position post paying down that debt, we'll always continue to look at share repurchases as an option. And M&A is always on the table. It's just there hasn't been any interesting process over the last several quarters. So hopefully, if people think between the interest rates coming down and M&A being more conducive, hopefully, there'll be some interesting prospects. But again, that would have to be not only financially attractive, be an acceleration to our tech road map journey. Operator : The next question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Compass Point. Please go ahead. Dominick Gabriele : So, I guess, I was just curious if there was any change in the expected pace and deemphasizing some of the lower growth, less profitable businesses? You touched a little bit on it earlier in the call, but if you could give some extra color there? Greg Adelson : Yes, it's a great question. And honestly, I was going to bring it up even in Will's question, so I'm glad you did. So, we are focused on it. Some of these things, as we've mentioned through Investor Day and individual meetings is that this process of product rationalization is going to take several years for it to completely take fruition. There are some opportunities that we're exploring on whether they would be small businesses of a potential divestiture, as we talked about before. I already mentioned a couple of products that we've been announcing sunsettings. So, those take -- we typically get two years for that to happen. Some of that will allow us to move customers faster to the better margin and faster advancing products like Banno [indiscernible] to Banno, and Yellow Hammer to Financial Crimes and things along that line. But there's other things that we're doing that will take a little bit more time and scrutiny that we're still working through, but it is a priority. We actually just came out of our strategy meeting, and it continues to be a priority, and we have a team focused on it. Mimi Carsley : The only other color I would lay on there for your question. It's doubtful but it's doubtful at this point that you see like one big chunk in a quarter. Some of these -- we're going to pursue different [indiscernible] whether it be sunsetting, whether it be just more cash tally, whether it be actual looking at divestitures. So, I doubt that they stack up one on top of each other timing lines to have that big of a noticeable impact to any one quarter. Obviously, we would call that out. But I think it's just over time, you'll see the improvement of that non-key revenue be less of a drag on the total performance. Greg Adelson : And it should -- based on what we've been doing in the analyzation, it's also going to help us with some of the level of tech modernization in the shared services environment and some of the cost containment and expense control back to our focus on continued margin expansion. So, all of those things will help us drive both the revenue growth as well as the margin. Dominick Gabriele : Yes, for sure. And it was nice to see the margin being better than you were expecting this quarter. I guess, the election results basically just happened. So, I'm just going to go back to this for a second. Do you think that -- do you have any sense from your clients that they were holding up certain tech investments until they understood who the winner was going to be? And do you think that there's incremental tech spend that they're likely going to pursue that maybe was not captured in just the budget growth that you guys talk about once or twice a year in your surveys, do you think that could come through in like complementary products, where they're going to start making some of those discretionary investments because of how the election went and maybe more or less? Greg Adelson : Honestly, I don't, at this point, just because we've been so direct and have gotten so such positive feedback on what they do want to do which all make collective sense regardless of who is in the White House. Now, I don't know what I don't know. I do -- there could be opportunities that happened through the M&A environment and folks are looking at opportunities to maybe purchase -- have an M&A, and there could be products that get accelerated because of an opportunity that, that particular bank had or didn't have. But I would say based on what we know today and the most recent feedback we literally just got a month ago at our CEO forum, I don't see that necessarily as of today. Operator : And the next question comes from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Peter Heckmann : Greg, I just wanted to see with JH&A Investor Conference Connect, how much of a priority or how much emphasis are you putting on the modern core modular platform? And how is that resonating with clients? And is it your sense that some of these multibillion-dollar institutions are really looking for a vendor that has a pretty well thought out and underway process to migrate towards an unbundled core? I mean how important is that in terms of their decision-making? Greg Adelson : Yes. I think from the prospects that were there, and we -- as I mentioned, we had 50 prospects and I met personally with 15 of them for a period of time. Yes, the strategy of what we're doing, so it's not just about the unbundling of the Core, it's just the strategy of taking the core into the public cloud and not just Core, but also some of the non-Core products that we've built, understanding the value of being in the public cloud. So those prospects, and of course, our clients as well, but our prospects have told us that they're not seeing that same level of conversation with whom they're with today. So yes, that strategy plays strongly in it. But it also plays the other things that we emphasize. Our culture, our service, the other innovative technology that we've been building through the years with whether that be Financial Crimes or what we've done in Pay Center or what we've done in in our enterprise account opening and things along that line. So, it is a combination of things, Pete, that drive this, but the overall strategy, not just Core, but the overall strategy is what is gravitating then to Jack Henry. Mimi Carsley : If I may add on, I think also what's really resonating is that shared services. So, as we build componentry for the tech modernization, that\u2019s supporting and enhancing the experience on the existing core that. And so, that's giving people comfort that there's innovation on the core that they might go to today as well as where they're going tomorrow. Greg Adelson : Yes. One last point, and I did emphasize this, was the open philosophy. When they walk into our tech showcase 250 fintechs that are there versus other client conferences, they also -- they know we are putting our money where our mouth is. And the reality is, they understand that Jack Henry is going to allow them to pick what is the best product for them. And so that is a big part, too, because they're not getting that same level of cooperation today. If they do want to go with a fintech or do an outsize of the base integration, as I referenced before, they're typically getting charged and I am going to [indiscernible] to do it. Peter Heckmann : Okay. That's helpful. And then can you just -- you haven't talked too much about the loan origination platform. Can you talk a little bit about some of your thoughts there in terms of solutions on the lending side and whether not that's something that we might hear a little bit more about over the next few years? Greg Adelson : Yes. And I expect you to hear more in starting in 2025. So, we've been working on combining -- the loan vantage platform now has been built to be a single consumer and commercial platform. And we've taken the account opening software, what we call, OpenAnywhere, and we've added that into the solution. So, it's now called Enterprise Account Opening. And it will allow the institution to -- it competes very nicely with nCino or anybody else out in the market today. And we are -- we will be in what we call early adopter in January 2025, so it's coming up, and so we'll start to have some of our customers kind of working through that with us. But we are very excited about that and what opportunities it will continue to bring to our financial institutions. Mimi Carsley : And it is the top priority [indiscernible] from our strategic benchmark service. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Kennedy with William Blair. Please go ahead. Chris Kennedy : Greg, you mentioned data broker a couple of times. Can you just remind us of what the opportunity is there? And just maybe talk about the CFPB rule and open banking and how that drives that? Greg Adelson : Yes. So let me start with the CFPB rule. So, 1033, if you remember back to some of the comments that we have made in prior quarters where we had eliminated screen scraping in our Banno digital platform. We're the only provider that's 100% eliminated screen scraping. So, we are already ahead of what was coming out with 1033 knowing that there was going to be something. And we now have direct API integrations into eight of the leading financial data aggregators. So, the big names that you've heard of like Finicity, Yodlee, and Plaid, Intuit and MX, but there are several others. And I think we have like eight or nine more in the queue to do full API. So -- and as a reminder, this is really -- this rule does not impact Core. It really impacts digital banking providers. So, we are significantly ahead of anybody in the space today for that -- for 1033. Related to Data Broker, so Data Broker, we have a few clients that are live that have been testing this in our early adopter. But the reality is that we are bringing into a single data repository, the ability for our customers to get their core data, their digital data, their payments data, their fraud data, their lending data, all from Jack Henry in a single repository as well as we are giving access to third party that whoever third parties, they use to be able to bring that data in as well. And of course, we've got all the guardrails and things that we need to do to make sure that, that happens. So, we're just in early stages of bringing some of the groups in. So, we have core in there today. We have digital in there today. We'll have payments in by the end of the calendar year, and we'll have fraud in by the end of the first quarter of 2025. So, we expect more sales to occur, obviously, as you get more and more of the data in there. But we've been testing it out. It's going really well. As far as uptick in revenue, probably not much in 2025, but we do expect it to be something that will help drive 2026. Operator : And the next question comes from John Davis with Raymond James. Please go ahead. John Davis : Mimi, we talked a lot about the second half but wanted to touch on margins only guide implies margins will be up somewhere close to 100 basis points in the back half of the year. Obviously, you have revenue accelerating, easier comps, anything else to call [indiscernible] on the margin front right now? Mimi Carsley : Yes. So, I would say the first half was -- is a little bit more pronounced from the headwinds we've seen both the software usage, and additionally, I would call out Q2 is a bit of a tough comp has immediate impact. We had the departures last year Q2, but not the replacement. And so that's a bit of a grow-over from a headcount from the roughly like 250 heads that are going to be Q2 '25 versus Q2 '24. So, I think those things make a little bit challenging in the first half. But as we get to the second half, it certainly aligns to our revenue growth. So, I feel pretty comfortable with the full year guide of the 25 to 40 basis points. John Davis : Okay. Great. And then, Greg, you called out 20% increase in Banno users year-over-year. Is Banno for business, a meaningful contributor to that? And if so, is it safe to assume that Banno revenue is growing well above that 20% user growth number? Greg Adelson : Yes. The Banno Business is not a meaningful contributor, it is a contributor. But as far as the growth, it truly is about our implementation numbers, and so as we add more and more business customers, yes, there can be some additional users. But that growth of 20% has been -- really been driven through the retail platform. But as we continue to add, remember, the way we price Banno Business is that the retail customer, if they -- regardless of how many retail customers they have, they pay that same amount of -- and it's kind of an add-on fee to what the retail piece is. So, as we continue to get more penetration and some things that we are doing to actually do adoption activities, I think that, that number will become more and more meaningful. But as far as the revenue growth, we've been kind of consistent over the last year or two years on where we've been on the revenue growth in the digital side. And remember, digital is more than just Banno. Operator : And the next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette : Wanted to ask, Greg, really quickly, you mentioned the implementation queues. And just wondering how those are trending broadly and how are you thinking right now about the puts and takes between the margin expansion you're delivering versus potential for additional resource allocation to help speed up those implementations? Greg Adelson : Yes, thanks James. Yes, we look at that literally every month as part of our discussions with our teams during what we do variance reviews with them. And so, we balance that very well. We've added people in our Financial Crimes Defender Group last year, a significant number, honestly, to do that. Some of that is implementations are in some cases, especially in financial crimes, they can take up to six months because of the data that needs to get transferred over. So, some of it isn't just a people thing. Some of it is purely just waiting. The other thing is that a lot of these can be tied to a Core implementation, so they get delayed until the Core gets done as well. So -- but we absolutely evaluate the need to expedite the revenue flow and balance it against the operating margin. So -- but we do that literally every month. James Faucette : Got it. And then I'm wondering, it's been a few months since you announced the partnership with Moov. It seems like an interesting potential product both for Jack Henry as well as Jack Henry's customers. Just any update on kind of progress there and when we may start to see that enter the market commercially? Greg Adelson : Yes. So, lots of progress. We've made honestly a lot of advancement even since Investor Day, when we publicly announced it. We did a full demo of this at our client conference in front of the 4,000 people that were there and got rate reviews for them being able to see that. As far as timing, as I announced, we're on time to be able to deliver this to our early adopter Banno clients in May of 2025, and so we're on track to do that. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Ken Suchoski : I wanted to circle back on the cloud migration. I think you said cloud revenue was 30% of revenue growing low double digits. I think you have 70%, 75% of clients on the private cloud. Can you just give us a sense for how much runway there is for cloud revenue to continue to grow at these double-digit rates? Are you seeing any traction in the public cloud yet? Just trying to get a sense for how sustainable that growth is on the cloud side and maybe where the revenue shows up across the segments as well? Greg Adelson : Yes. Ken, I'll start with just kind of the migration and then let Mimi go through the revenue component of it. But -- so we are at 73% right now in the private cloud. And so, we don't expect to get to 100%, and we expect to be somewhere in the low- to mid-90s because there'll just be some of the customers that just don't want to move. And -- but we have several years. We're still expecting this year to do our normal 40-ish from an in to out. And so, there'll be somewhere in those numbers. And we're really on track. We had, based on first quarter of last year versus first quarter of this year, our ins to out was very similar in number. And the other thing that's happening is that we are down to a lot of our larger clients. So, even if we move less or fewer in a quarter, they typically are larger clients that are bring more of an impact as well. And just as a reminder, on average, between banks and credit unions, about 1.75 increase. So that is part of where we are. As far as years of run away, we expect to be three, four, five more years of that at some pace. But at the same time, I announced earlier about the deposit only Core being ready in 2026. So, we could see some lift at that point in time of folks moving either directly from in-house to the public cloud or from the private cloud to the public cloud or being in both because it will be a deposit-only Core in 2026 as we build out the rest of the Core components. So, more to come on that, but we still have some runway and they are larger customers. Mimi Carsley : Yes. I mean, I think Greg hit on all the salient points that there's still runway to go. The clients are potentially larger. Also, our clients grow, we grow with our clients as they grow. So even the ones that are early in our private cloud environment as they had more accounts, as they grow and expand, we're going to continue to get revenue growth with them. So, that's the only other thing I would call out from just -- it's continuing to be a strong growth engine for us in the future. Ken Suchoski : Okay. Great. And as you said non-GAAP revenue would grow 6% in the second quarter. Can you just remind us of the building blocks, I guess, by segment just to get to that 6%? Mimi Carsley : Yes. I think we can follow-up offline in terms of the components. But I would just say like on a whole, I don't expect to see a lot of different changes from the momentum we had in Q1 in terms of for the segment. We still think that for cards, Q2 is going to be a little bit better than Q1. But it's still probably a modest spend expectation. We feel -- as cloud is our slowest quarter in Q2. Hardware has less of a drag than Q1, but still a drag in Q2 as well. So -- and you have some drag in some small things like call center and processing So I think that's what's leading us to that 6% and then taking off solidly from there in the back half. Operator : And the next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead. David Koning : A couple of things. First of all, card processing, you put that in the press release was 5% growth, last quarter was 8% growth. And I know like the networks and stuff were pretty stable growth. Was there anything in there just to call out why that decelerated a bit? Mimi Carsley : Yes. I think our transaction volume was pretty much in line, I would say, where we've seen on the positive side, we've seen higher ramp from a faster payment spend, and that's really taking off. The bill pay from the rest of it is a modest kind of grower from the EPS business, a little slower than prior year, but modest growth. So, I think that's pretty much in line. Greg Adelson : [indiscernible] David Koning : Okay. And then the one other thing, the -- and we talked about this last quarter, too, interest income remains high. And you guys had a ramp kind of 1.5 years-or-so later than I would say a lot of other -- I guess you had some ramp a while ago, but you've really ramped that up a lot in the last year-or-so now. And again, it was really high in Q1. Does that stay -- or what created kind of a little later ramp in that? And does that stay kind of stable through the year? Mimi Carsley : Mostly, I would say, it was due to just the timing of negotiations with some of our bank counter-parties in terms of getting more attractive yield on those balances. It does have some correlation with interest rates. So, I think it's pretty stable for Q2. We'll see what the Fed does in the back half of the year and what pace they do. But I would say you'll see some correlation with interest rates and interest income. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vance Sherard for any closing remarks. Vance Sherard : Thank you, Viate.
