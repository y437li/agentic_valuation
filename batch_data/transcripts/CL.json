Good day, everyone. And welcome to today's Colgate-Palmolive Company First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Just as a reminder, there may be a slight delay before the question-and-answer session begins due to the web simulcast. And at this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Bina Thompson. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Bina Thompson : Thank you, Nancy, and good morning. And welcome to our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, President, Chairman and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. This conference call will include forward-looking statements and these statements are made on the basis of our views and assumptions as of this time and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual events or results may differ materially from these statements. So for information about certain factors that could cause such differences, investors should consult our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on our website, including the information set forth under the captions Risk Factors and Cautionary Statements on forward-looking statements. And this conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, which differ from our results compared in accordance with GAAP. We will discuss organic sales growth, which is net sales growth excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. And we will also discuss gross profit, gross profit margin, SG&A as a percent of net sales, operating profit, operating profit margin, net income and earnings per share on a diluted basis, excluding the impact of certain items described in the press release. And a full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the press release and is posted in the For Investors section of our website at www.colgatepalmolive.com. We are delighted with our results for the first quarter. As we exited 2013, we said we were excited about continuing our momentum and that has indeed happened. Our organic sales growth was at the high end of our target range of 5% to 7%, on top of strong growth of 6% in the prior year and with a good balance between volume and price. In fact, our pricing increase of 1.5% was against the highest level of pricing performance of any quarter last year and we expect this good performance to continue. In light of precipitous declines of currencies versus the dollar during the quarter, we are pleased that our gross profit margin was even with last year\u2019s level. While we had forecasted an improvement year-over-year, lack of growth was primarily due to the transaction costs associated with the aforementioned currency headwinds. However, our Funding the Growth Program is as robust as it has ever been and as you know, an integral part of our company culture. So as we are able to take pricing as we go through the year to offset the sudden currency moves, we expect to see our gross margin improve each quarter. We are particularly pleased about the savings being generated from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. As we told you when we announced the program in the fourth quarter of 2012, we felt it would serve us well as we entered turbulent times and indeed it has. We also said that the bulk of the savings would be reflected in overhead expenses and in the first quarter we delivered a 30 basis point reduction in overhead spending, which allowed us to increase our advertising as a percent of net sales to support what continues to be a very robust pipeline of innovation around the world. Our balance sheet is solid with strong cash generation, as well as excellent working capital control. So, a good start to the year, which bodes well for the remainder of 2014. So let\u2019s turn to the divisions starting with North America. We are particularly pleased with the solid organic sales growth in North America. This growth of 3.5% was against 5.5% in the year ago quarter, which was the strongest quarter for 2013. A full array of new products across categories contributed to the results and as referenced in the press release, we grew our market shares in manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, dish liquids, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners. Colgate Optic White toothpaste is continuing to grow share from 2013 behind new products, strong marketing campaigns and more impactful claims. In February, we began to ship an uberpremium priced toothpaste line, expanding on our original Optic White whitening toothpaste. Optic White Platinum Whiten & Protect, a new product in the line, adds stain prevention technology to the whitening power of the original Optic White formula to help maintain whiter teeth. In addition, we relaunched Optic White Dual Action as Optic White Platinum White & Radiant, which contains extra polishing brighteners to add shine. An impactful media, print and shopper campaign to support the Optic White Platinum launch emphasizes whiter teeth in just one day by using the entire Optic White regimen including the Colgate Optic White Toothbrush + Built-In Whitening Pen. Along with these new toothpastes we introduced Colgate Optic White mouthwash with Whiteseal technology. The new formula combines stain prevention with the whitening power of Colgate\u2019s original Optic White Mouthwash, along with a significantly enhanced taste profile. The launch of Colgate Optic White Toothbrush + Built-In Whitening Pen, which we told you about last quarter, has been very well received. In March, it achieved an 8.1 share and has been driving almost the entire manual toothbrush category growth year-to-date and as you would expect, we have continued strong commercial support planned for the remainder of the year. Regimen approach has served us well with our Colgate Total franchise. Colgate Total mouthwash launched in May of last year behind record retail support has been driving overall category growth. Trial and repeat levels are outpacing other competitive launches, contributing to an overall mouthwash share of over 6% on a year-to-date basis, up from the year ago period. And we have also reinvigorated the graphics on our Colgate Total toothpaste line and have increased our professional marketing efforts with dental office sampling and detailing aids, as well as advertising in dental and scientific journals. As I said, our market share in dish liquid was up in the quarter. Driving this in part was the launch of Palmolive Dish + Sink which helps eliminate odors to freshen the air around the sink as you do dishes. A strong marketing campaign only began in April but we saw excellent results right after our launch. As you know, our business in the Hispanic market is very strong and a number of years ago, we launched Suavitel Fabric Conditioner, the leading brand in Mexico, in the U.S. In first quarter this year we launched a new variant, Suavitel Fast Dry, with a breakthrough patent-pending formula that softens clothes and contains moisture wicking polymers that allow fabric to quickly shed water so that clothes dry 30% faster. This has contributed to an all-time high national fabric conditioner share of 17.5% in March, with over 1% coming just from this new product. More new product activity is expected for the third quarter of this year which you will hear about soon. Turning now to Europe/South Pacific. We are very pleased with the organic sales growth of 1.5% in this region, strongest growth in five quarters. Innovation played a key role in the results and from a macroeconomic standpoint, we are cautiously optimistic. While Southern Europe still remains a challenge, it appears that Northern Europe is showing modest signs of recovery, now market shares increased in many Oral Care categories, up in toothpaste, battery toothbrushes and electric toothbrushes. We are very pleased with the launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer, biggest innovation against cavities since the introduction of fluoride more than 50 years ago and we are off to a good start, after only six weeks in market in Denmark, we have achieved a 3.8 share, after two weeks in Norway a 3.2 share and after two weeks in Portugal a full point. In Australia, our latest four-week share is 5.4%. We will continue to rollout this product across the region. We told you last quarter about the launch of Colgate Max White One Optic toothpaste. This quarter we have re-launched our Colgate Max White One mouthwash with an advanced stain prevention system to seal out the stains and seal in the natural whiteness and as you would expect, this is being supported by a full integrated marketing campaign in synergy with the toothpaste. Also launching this quarter is Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal toothbrush, first developed in Asia, which has 17 times slimmer tip bristles with charcoal for better cleaning between the teeth and along the gum line. An interesting opportunity for us in the personal care category is the entry into the kids\u2019 body wash category, where we currently have no offering. This subcategory is growing around 8%, outpacing the overall category growth of 2%. And bundle to be launched in the second quarter, uses playful graphics to appeal to children and a mild natural formula with a Pediatrician Approved claim to appeal to their parents. A seasonal launch expected to provide additional distribution is Palmolive Sensacao do Brazil. This line of shower gels seizes on Europeans passion for football and the resulting interest in Brazilian culture heightened around this summers World Cup, combination of unique fragrances, natural ingredients and attractive graphics should deliver heightened impact in store. Our Home Care business in Europe is strong, leading brands such as Ajax and Soupline. Under the Ajax brand we are launching Ajax all Uage Gel, one cleaner to clean your entire house. The formula has a concentrated efficacy and the bottle has a versatile press and dosage cap. Turning to Latin America, momentum continues across the region with another quarter of double-digit organic growth, consistent flow of innovation allowed us to maintain our strong leading shares in tooth paste and toothbrushes. And our mouthwash market share was up half a point year-to-date behind successful launches such as Plax Tea Fresh and Plax 2 in 1 market shares increased as well in fabric conditioner, hand dish and liquid cleaners. In Brazil, our year-to-date toothpaste share remained over 71%. As you know, this was one of the lead countries for our launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Neutrazucar toothpaste. Shipments started in October of last year and our 2014 share year-to-date is 2.2% with the most recent lead at 3%. Our leading Brazilian toothbrush share reached a record 33.1% on a year-to-date basis, fueled by good performance in our premium end of the business. Our Brazilian bar soap business achieved a record market leading share of 26.5% on a year-to-date basis, new products in both the Palmolive and Protex lines have helped achieve this result. In Mexico, we saw a standout performance in our underarm protection business with our year-to-date share increasing 30 basis points to 19.6%, the highest in almost a decade. We told you about the launch of Men\u2019s Speed Stick Stress Defense deodorant last quarter and we have more innovation slated for the second quarter. In fact, new product activity is planned for the second quarter across categories throughout Latin America. Building on the insight that many consumers think about toothpaste as taking care of their teeth and not the rest of the mouth, we have launched a new integrated marketing campaign to support Colgate Total which explains its benefit of protecting all areas of the mouth to give 100% confidence. In the whitening category, we are launching Colgate Luminous White Advanced toothpaste with the benefit of three shades whiter teeth with the same whitening ingredient dentists use. And, of course, we will continue the launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpaste across the region. In Personal Care, we are launching Protex Omega 3 bar soaps, liquid soaps and shower gels. Its formula, with moisturizers, helps keep your family\u2019s skin healthier while eliminating 99.9% of bacteria. As well, we will be introducing Lady Speed Stick Aclarado Perfecto plus Vitamin E deodorant. Its formula, with vitamin E and mother of pearl extract, helps show your natural skin tone while blocking sweat. And, in the Home Care category, we have taken an idea from a Palmolive launch in the U.S. market. In Latin America, using the Axion equity for hand dishwashing liquid, we launched Axion Good Bye Odors. Residues from dishes and sponges can cause bad odors and this new product eliminates the bacteria that may cause these odors. Turning now to Asia. Organic sales growth in Asia continues to be robust, increasing 7.5% in the quarter. New products supported by an increase in advertising have driven the top line growth and market share gains. Across the region, we increased our market shares in manual toothbrushes, mouthwash and shampoo. In India, our toothpaste market share is up 60 basis points to 53.8% on a year-to-date basis, even in the face of heightened competition. Our toothbrush shares there are up as well, up 140 basis points to 44.5% year-to-date. Strong communication and trade plans have helped drive these results. In China, we remain the market leader in toothpaste by a wide margin at over 34% year-to-date. Our Chinese toothbrush shares increased as well, up 70 basis points to over 26% year-to-date. Malaysia was our lead market in Asia for the launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpaste. That new product, introduced in February of this year, as well as other premium bundles, helped lift our toothpaste share 60 basis points to 73.4% on a year-to-date basis. In the second quarter, we will be rolling out into new markets some of the innovation that has already helped drive growth elsewhere in the region, Colgate Total Charcoal Deep Clean toothpaste, Colgate 360 Charcoal toothbrush and Colgate Slim Soft Dual Action toothbrush. Africa/Eurasia. Organic sales growth continues to be robust in this region. As mentioned in the press release, some of the strength came from Russia even in the face of all the turmoil in that country. Our innovation in this region continues to drive growth as elsewhere. In the toothpaste category, innovation in Russia has helped us to maintain our market leading share of over 32% year-to-date. Colgate Altai Herbs toothpaste was launched there recently. Altai is a region of Russia known for its herbal remedies. As a companion product, we also launched Colgate Altai Herbs mouthwash, which has driven our year-to-date mouthwash market share up almost 2 full points to 27.6%. Our shower gel market share across this region is up over a point and a half year-to-date. In Russia and Turkey where we launched Palmolive Gourmet Spa, our year-to-date market shares are up 2 and 3.6 points, respectively, to 23.1% and 39.1%. You may recall this line of shower gels is highly experiential with chocolate, vanilla and strawberry fragrances. In South Africa, Palmolive Thermal Spa Skin Renewal shower gel has contributed to a 3 point share increase to 27.1% on a year-to-date basis. Our innovation continues in the second quarter. In toothpaste, we will be launching Colgate Optic White Instant with optical brighteners for a whiter smile and instantly visible whiter teeth. I mentioned earlier the launch of Colgate Altai Herbs toothpaste and mouthwash in Russia where the Altai region is well known for its herbal ingredients. Capitalizing on the success of this launch we will be launching Palmolive Altai Herbs bar soap, liquid hand soap and shower gel. This mini line of body cleansing is inspired by Altai authentic recipes and its formulas contain natural extracts of herbs to revive body and spirit. Also in Russia, in the underarm category we will be launching Lady Speed Stick Altai Herbs Freshness, an antiperspirant in sprays, sticks and roll-ons that give your skin a superior feeling of natural purity and long-lasting freshness to keep you confident and attractive. Hill\u2019s. We are very pleased with the continued solid results in our Hill\u2019s business, both domestically and overseas. An important driver here in the U.S., as you know, has been the launch of Hill\u2019s Ideal Balance, and that continues to meet with success. Consumption at the super stores is strong and growing up 50% year to date over the prior year and has been helped by a wide array of innovation in the naturals category. In February, we launched 11 new dry variants, nine wet and three treats in both dog and cat. For dogs, Ideal Balance Slim and Healthy and Ideal Balance Active, for cats, Ideal Balance Indoors, Ideal Balance Hairball and Ideal Balance Slim and Healthy. To support this innovation, this quarter we will continue with not only media but in-store support in the superstores with impactful pallet displays as well as coupons offered by brand ambassadors and nutritional consultants. Our Hill\u2019s Science Diet business is strong as well. An interesting new marketing campaign is being implemented as we speak at PetSmart, Paws for Health. Based on the shopper insight that pet parents know they don\u2019t take their pets to the vet as often as they should but it is important to them to do what they can to ensure the pet has a longer healthier life. In-store consultants educate pet parents about the importance of preventative care for their pet and drive awareness and provide trial sizes of Hill\u2019s Science Diet products in the LifeCare product grouping. Our Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet business is also doing well. We have told you about our Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet Metabolic for weight control. That has been met with terrific acceptance. Our Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet business is also doing well. We have told you about our Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet Metabolic for weight control. We will continue the momentum on the business with in-clinic activities, testimonial campaigns to drive vet endorsement and sampling and new client starter kits As you know, the science behind our weight control is uniquely innovative. As mentioned above, we have leveraged it with our Ideal Balance line and have launched weight control products in the Science Diet line as well. And our robust new product program will continue throughout the year. We will be launching Hill\u2019s Ideal Balance throughout Europe where the naturals category is just beginning. Another exciting innovation we referenced in our press release is Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet Stews, a breakthrough in wet food technology. The proprietary processing technique and natural ingredients produce a therapeutic food for dogs and cats with delicious appearance, and superior efficacy. So in summary, we are very pleased with the way 2014 has started out. The momentum we saw as we exited 2013 has continued in all regions of the world. Our new product pipeline is full across all categories and our ongoing savings programs as well as our Global Growth and Efficiency Program are providing funds to support that robust innovation. And as we implement our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, our people are becoming even more focused on winning on the ground each and every day. We look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go forward throughout the year. And now, Nancy, I would like to turn the call over to you to start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go first to Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley : Good morning. Ian Cook : Hey, Dara. Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley : So, first, just a clarification, Bina mentioned you expected gross margin improvement each quarter this year. Are you still expecting 75 to 125 basis points for the full year and then, the real question is your toothpaste and toothbrush market share momentum looks like it\u2019s slow this quarter. The toothpaste year-over-year share change was the worst we\u2019ve seen recently. So, I was just hoping for more detail on what\u2019s driving that performance, particularly which geographies and your view on if the share losses will continue going forward or if that\u2019s more temporary factors in Q1? Ian Cook : Okay, Dara. Let me -- before I get to the gross margin, let me put the gross margin position in sort of a broader context and underscore a couple of the points that Bina has already made. First, we are very pleased with the first quarter\u2019s topline performance and we would reaffirm our target range of organic growth for the year at between 5% and 7%. We think that is going to be a very strong range, particularly as our categories remain range bound in Europe, growing at between 1% and 2% and similarly so in North America. And in our emerging markets, we see category growth rates slowing slightly from 6% to 8% range previously to now 5% to 7%. And the things we think will continue to drive that organic rate of growth are in innovation and of course the advertising, which was up absolutely and as a percent of sales this quarter and we expect it to be up absolutely and as a percentage to sales for the year. Now very importantly, of course, Dara, as you correctly point out, is the gross margin and what our expectations are for gross margin during the year. We are still comfortable with the gross margin expansion of between 75 and 125 basis points. But obviously given recent foreign exchange volatility, which we have to react to and our, we would say that our margin expansion will be at the lower end of that range more in a 70 to 100 basis points band. Our funding of the growth program remains strong and I think some were little bit questioning our ability to take pricing in Latin America in the fourth quarter. And I think you see in the first quarter what is the usual sequence in these events, which is there is a lead lag between the foreign exchange impact, particularly when it is, as precipitates as we saw in this first quarter and you will see pricing continue across the balance of the year. And all of that led us to reiterate our EPS guidance of 4% to 5% on a dollar basis for this year or double digit currency neutral. And I\u2019m reading some of the earlier notes this morning. Let me just walk through that reiteration. I think most of you will remember that in our release at the end of January, when we announced our fourth quarter results, we expressed growth of EPS in line with the consensus of external analysts\u2019 estimates at that time and then in February, February 18th to be price, we made our disclosure and announcement on Venezuela and indicated from that proposition that the Venezuela impact would be between $0.11 and $0.14 to EPS on the year with the first quarter at $0.03 to $0.04. And then of course today, we disclosed that the first quarter was $0.03 and we expect the rate going forward to be at the same $0.03 per quarter, $0.12 on the year, consistent with the prior range and at that 4% to 5% a dollar and double-digit currency neutral rate. To come to market share, a couple of comments on toothpaste. First of all, the shares that we talk about are dollar weighted, that\u2019s the way we collect the data and aggregate it. And in Venezuela, we have an extremely elevated market share. We are still trying to find the three Venezuelans that don\u2019t brush with our toothpaste. So given the currency moves in Venezuela, about a third of the share decline that you highlighted, the 1.3 points is simply mathematical to do without dollar weighting. The other two geographies of an operating nature are the U.S. and Mexico as we have said before, and we said that our innovation and some adjustments to our marketing program to meet the competitive promotional activity we saw in both of those markets would be taken and they have been taken. And I think in the U.S., some of you had already commented on the more recent consumption and share data that the toothpaste progress for Colgate is good. We continue to see that in the near-term weekly data and we expect that to continue going forward. Same actions have been taken in Mexico and we expect to saying forward progress to strengthen our share in the 80 range. And in addition, in Mexico, we have just this month introduced the superior anti-cavity toothpaste, which has been highlighted has done very well, everywhere we had launched it. Toothbrushes are affected by the same Venezuela calculation. Indeed, the modest 30 basis points decline you highlighted there is entirely driven by the Venezuela mathematical calculation. All of our divisions are either flat to up in market share with the exception of Africa, Eurasia where we are responding to in South Africa and Russia, specifically local market activity which we fully expect to be reversed over time. So no, we do not expect or plan for those share positions to continue as you laid them out. Operator : (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go next to Steve Powers with UBS. Steve Powers - UBS: Hi, Ian. Thanks. Ian Cook : Hi, Steve. Steve Powers - UBS: I guess it was another solid quarter as you say of organic growth, 6.5%, overall and especially, 10%, in the emerging markets. How do you think about that relative to some of the outsized inflation that we are seeing in certain markets, especially in Latin America? If you agree with that characterization, especially in Argentina, Venezuela for example, how do you estimate that is adding to your organic growth, or conversely do you believe it\u2019s really not that additive given the degree of volume and mix trade-offs in those same markets? Thanks. Ian Cook : Yes. I would say if you look at the underpinning volume in Latin America for example, we view that as very healthy. When you talk about outsized inflation in Venezuela, remember that is true from a macro point of view, but bylaw in Venezuela, we are extremely restricted on availability to take pricing across most of our business. So I think we are very pleased with the progress. We view it to be real substantive and we see it continuing. Operator : We\u2019ll move to the next question with Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson - Citi: Hi, good morning. I don\u2019t want to be a dead horse on this pricing in Latin America thing, but that\u2019s my question too. And the question is, historically when there has been currency question in Latin America, the pricing you could able to take on an annual basis I get that there is a [lie] (ph), but on an annual basis it\u2019s pretty much close to a 1 offset. And my question is, if you look at the 6% pricing you got in the first quarter versus the 16% currency headwind, how much of that is Venezuela, how much of that is just timing? I mean, if we are going to see, let\u2019s call it in mid-teems currency headwind in Latin America, can you take anywhere close to that pricing ex-Venezuela because I think everybody is just nervous that maybe the competitive dynamic is preventive you from taking as much pricing? If you can answer that, that would be great. Ian Cook : Okay. Well, the answer is no, it\u2019s not driven by competitors. As I said, when we posted just over 2% pricing in the fourth quarter, I think that question was raised that you now limited in terms of your ability to take pricing. And the answer is no, we are not. And I think the first quarter demonstrated that in quite a healthy way remembering we are not able in the first quarter given the move of some of the exchanges to take the pricing as quickly as the exchange takes the cost up for transaction reasons. And in Venezuela, you frankly have to take Venezuela out of the equation because for the majority of that business, we are unable bylaw to take pricing. But we have demonstrated in the past and I think with Venezuela to one side, as far as the rest of Latin America is concerned, we have demonstrated an ability to price, to offset the foreign exchange. Indeed, in the more recent term, the Brazilian exchange is turn a we bit positive, but our plan would be as it has been in the past to be able to offset the transaction impact to foreign exchange with the pricing and funding the growth. Operator : We\u2019ll move to the next question from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline Levy - CLSA: Actually again I am sorry to get you around this issue. I'm looking at Asia and Eurasia where the currency impact substantially has been, certainly we were the expecting and I guess there was deterioration towards the end of the quarter. Do you expect to be able to get pricing in those markets as you move through the year? Ian Cook : The answer is yes, the answer is yes. We will be able to take the pricing in those markets. One has to say exactly as you said Caroline that the precipitous make sure of the currency moves in some of those geographies. I come back to everyone\u2019s estimation of the year, I'm not sure I saw anybody planning on the Crimea and the impact of Crimea on the Russian Ruble. So some of those moves were really quite precipitous but we have the capability to take pricing. We had done so in some geographies already and we have plans and indeed are right now taking pricing in some of those markets to address the headwind of transaction. So we continue to have pricing capability. There is just a natural lead lag in terms of how quickly you can practically respond particularly when the foreign exchange has moved so quickly. And I think in the world that we are in, our ability to plan for gross margin expansion are between 75 and 100 basis points a test to that capability. Operator : We'll take the next question from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo : Hi, thanks. Ian Cook : Hi Chris. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo : Hi Ian. I guess I wanted to ask you about the slowdown you just cited in developing in emerging market and a point I guess is not a huge deal considering what we've seen elsewhere. But can you talk a little bit about, is that isolated to any specific geographies and what do you think is driving that specifically besides maybe the obvious sort of macro situation and maybe just that. And then also why do you think you can gain more share than you have been and sustain the top-line growth rate in the face of the slower market relative to say what your thought couple of quarters ago? Ian Cook : Yes, I guess Chris. We're talking about fine differences here. We wanted to indicate that indeed we have seen a little bit of a slowdown. Other comments I have read from others suggest sharper than we have seen certainly in our businesses. I think it traces to the macros finally. In these cases, there is nothing untoward that we have seen so far in terms of consumer behavior. And I think our 5 to 7 range fits very nicely even with that slowdown. So I don't think it puts any more pressure on our desire, need or ability to build market share. Operator : And we\u2019ll move next to John Faucher with J.P. Morgan. John Faucher - J.P. Morgan: Thank you. In looking at your sort of how reported top-line growth will track over the course of the year and given the seasonality of the business, it's a little tough given the first quarter performance to get to the low end of the range from a gross margin standpoint. So can you walk us through sort of sequentially how we should think about just progressing through the year and sort of what the big changes are from Q1 to the balance of the year. Are there just efficacy from the additional pricing, what have you? Thanks. Ian Cook : Okay. I can\u2019t resist John. I thought you were one that was questioning whether we could deliver the gross margin expansion. Well, I think -- let me say so you can come back to me at the end. Let me start with the traditional roll forward just that we have that as a starting point and then I will try and answer your question from there. Obviously, it's flat, so the star point was the same 58.6 as it is this year. We picked up half a point from pricing. We picked up 1.4 from our funding the growth and a little bit of restructuring, material prices was a headwind of 2, a large part of that as we have already discussed was transaction. There was a modest 10 bps from other leading us to the 58.6. So I would say the three main buckets of progress for the year quite obviously are pricing where we expect to get more pricing and therefore more contribution to the gross profit, funding the growth along with a little bit from restructuring and you know that our funding the growth tends to build over the year. And that would be the second major aspect of building our gross margin. And by talking about 75 to 100, all I was trying to do was to frame coming off the high-end of the range, we are not suggesting a 75 increase in gross margin. Operator : We'll take the next question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merril Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merril Lynch : Thank you, I appreciate it. One quick question on housekeeping. Is it fair to assume the net interest expense will be similar to Q1, the Q1 rate going forward or whether any anomalies caught this quarter? And then on Hill's, I noticed that the margin was up for the first time in the last five quarters. And in the press release, you did state a number of puts and takes but one of them was lower ad spends. So was is just a function of comping against how you spend in a year ago as she prepped for the new line or if there shift in timing of spending or do you think there are just not a need to spend as much behind pet as you did before. And if that\u2019s the case, the change -- does the changing of hands for IMs, change your thought process in any way on that? Thank you. Ian Cook : Changing, of course, I guess who I am. But on your housekeeping question on net interest, the net interest expense we think we'll go up on the year. We'll probably be in the 35 to 40 range for the year largely due to changes in our capital structure as we have taken on some longer term debt at very attractive rates, planning ahead to world where rates are likely to increase. So yes but plan fully as part of readjusting our capital structure. Hill's is timing. Bina talked about some of the innovation on the Hill's business and the spending, we'll readjust. First quarter was strong last year because the timing of the innovation was earlier. So now we're very committed to our Hill's innovation flow which is very strong and frankly doing very well in market. Operator : We'll move next to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Bernstein: Hi guys. So just a quick clarification and then a core question. The clarification is want to give you the opportunity of selling Venezuela to the side. And just if you could tell us what volume and organic growth would have been in Latin America ex-Venezuela? And then the other question, so you say the EPS growth of 4% to 5%. In fact, I think the same has since February at least for the year. Is it still above consensus? And I know you guys and the background of your team does a really good job of taking of our models and looking at it. And I'm trying to understand if you guys have a perspective on where you think consensus is too high, is it just currencies or are there other things that you would like to be pointed to? Ian Cook : Yeah, well thanks for the opportunity to separate LatAm growth from Venezuela. But I shall politely decline that. We don't break it out in that way. I would say that we think, if you think about where Venezuela was three, four years ago as you well know it is substantially smaller portion of our corporation than it was then. And the Latin American growth, we think is very, very strong overall. In terms of the second point Ali. Yes, you're right the 4% to 5% as we try to reemphasize at the beginning of the call has been where we have been. And there is nothing in that reiteration of guidance for the year that reflects anything other than foreign exchange and I would clarify and say that is the foreign exchange that analyst reacted to in January of the year with the Venezuela change which by the way I think makes our Venezuelan reporting more conservative than some who has stayed at the 630 rate. And the -- it remains double-digits in terms of the EPS growth in local currency terms and in fact for the year looking forward after Venezuela, we see the currency impact for the year at around 5% which was pretty much where we had it before hand. So there is no incremental currency it nearly reflects actions taken through February of this year. So it is entirely currency related. There is nothing else. Operator : The next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank : Hey, good morning. Ian Cook : Hey, how are you? Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank : I'm good. So the cash balance is massive, right. It's also like two equity done historically. Are you guys -- what\u2019s the plan about the cash because certainly you don't need your working capitals getting better. There is super cash generated, I know you talked about, rates going up and locking some fixed rate debt. But is there a use for all that cash. And then second part of the question is well that in the same part of same question but the second question, is there a plan or way to get Venezuela profitable again. I know I lost money this quarter but is there anything you could do either structurally or strategically to get that turn positive again. Thanks. Ian Cook : Yes. The cash balance entirely timing, entirely timing. It\u2019s related to when we took the debt. It will be washed out as we go through the year debt and cash will get back in balance. Net debt will end up in the same place. So nothing strategic, nearly timing. With Venezuela, it is as you say modestly, it was very modest, negative for Venezuela in the first quarter. And obviously, we are in very constructive dialog with the government of this time about the need for relaxation of the pricing laws and for some pricing in order to make business in Venezuela profitable again. And we are hopeful that those discussions will lead to a productive outcome and that outcome of course, which has been our usual model and the rest of Latin America allows one to offset the gross margin pressure and see that translate through on the bottom line. So those are the issues. You know, of course, that the first quarter was hit particularly by the historical one-time hit and that will come out across the balance of the year anyway. So we\u2019ll be in a better position than we were in the first quarter but the step change would be driven by pricing. Operator : The next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Good morning, thanks. Ian Cook : Hey. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: How are you? The question on or the comment on the sugar. I always get the name wrong but the cavity protection toothpaste that you are rolling out. The comment that you\u2019re moving more throughout Europe and maybe the Australia, are there plan to meet from the near term to go to U.K., Germany, France, some of the bigger countries, it may in next quarter to. And is it contributing to the overall European growth at this point or is it still really too small? Ian Cook : To answer the last part of the -- actually you don\u2019t have to get the name right Bill, you just have to buy it. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: I get you. Ian Cook : Yeah. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: That sort of trouble. Ian Cook : In terms o Europe it is too early. We can say that in countries like Brazil, Turkey, Australia as Bina said that it is added to share nicely. We are expanding in Mexico as we\u2019ve said. You will see continued expansion across Europe and some of the other emerging markets, you could expect to cross the balance of the year. So we\u2019ll be moving quite broadly with this product, the reaction seems so far quite positive. Operator : We\u2019ll take the next question from Michael Steib with Credit Suisse. Michael Steib - Credit Suisse : Good morning. My question relates to raw material cost. I noticed that in most regions there were essentially a headwind to margins in the quarter, except in Europe where there were tailwind. I wonder is that all due to currencies or there other differences for example in the portfolio compensation as well. And then related to that, do you expect a similar headwind from raw material cost for the remainder of the year? Ian Cook : Well, let me react to both. I would say what we saw in the first quarter was indeed largely driven by foreign exchange, which is why we saw such a positive progress in Europe. I think training raw materials overall, we\u2019re expecting for the year, raw and packing materials to increase by between 1% and 2% for the year. That\u2019s raw and packing for the year. And as I have mentioned earlier, our ability to deliver the gross margin expansion that we are planning is going to be driven by pricing, which we have already to a certain extent and we\u2019ll deliver going forward t5o offset that foreign exchange impact on raw and packing material. Operator : We\u2019ll look at next question. It comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research : Hello. Good morning, everyone. I had a couple of questions, one on the restructuring. It seems like it was a big chunk this first quarter about 40% of what you plan for the year. Does it mean that you are taking it faster pace and originally plan in order to navigate this issue of a currency. And the other question has to do with Hill\u2019s. Certainly, very good performance, to what extent that has to do with the changes in planogram that (indiscernible) did or shall we continue seeing that at least for another quarter where we\u2019re going to see a strong growth from Hill\u2019s. Thank you. Ian Cook : Thanks, Javier. No, there\u2019s nothing particular about restructuring in terms of -- it's just timing, our full year, full program ranges remain the same, both at the cost and the benefit, and we don\u2019t manhandle the restructuring to try and address foreign exchange issues. I think the point we made when we announced it was it would simply give us some agility and flexibility knowing that given the volatility of foreign exchanges, and therefore cost quarters might be a little bit lumpy. Indeed, I\u2019m here which you are correct have here in the US. We had some quite meaningful planograms resets, which have been positive, which underpin the increase that Bina talked about a little bit earlier. And we continue to feel good about seeing our Hill\u2019s business go forward mid -single digits organic as we have spoken before. And the reason selling the planogram reset is good, but we\u2019ll get to the planogram reset is the quality of the innovation and trial generation that you can create for that innovation. And as we have said before, we think we have a very rich innovation pipeline now, which is moving to the market. Operator : And we\u2019ll move to Alec Patterson with AGI. Alec Patterson - AGI: Good morning. Ian Cook : Hey, Alec. Alec Patterson - AGI: Hi. So just quickly on the 75 and 100 basis points. I think I am crystallizing this into, it\u2019s predominantly moved to lower end because of currency. In other words, the other component, pricing and you have been planning all along. Commodity costs that are basically dollar commodity base were on pack. And then anything from funding the growth productivity haven\u2019t changed. Ian Cook : Correct. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our final question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs : Hey, good morning, folks. Ian Cook : Hey, Jason. Jason English - Goldman Sachs : Thank you for allowing the question. Two quick ones. First, a quick housekeeping question. Can you quantify how much the advanced customer shipments in Japan contribute to that growth this quarter? And then other question is back here to home North America, we\u2019ve been seen solid growth both on the measure data as well as clearly into reporter results today. Well, we sliced and diced the measure data around 70% of gross been coming for mouthwash. Market share up year-on -year but running stagnant to kind of flat line sequentially at 6. Two months from now you\u2019ll start rolling over that 7% share you got on the initial search, trial building. So how should we think about growth on a go forward? What are the initiatives that can maybe get mouthwash and other like higher or that can kick some of the categories into higher growth notes to drive more contribution for them? Ian Cook : Thanks, Jason. On mouthwash as you know, I talked about the toothpaste change in momentum. Obviously the toothbrush business share up over 41 is terrific. That of courses is the second largest category in oral care. Mouthwash, we are pleased where we are. Two things will continue to grow our business in mouthwash. Number one, innovation and the variants that come with that innovation which we have seen, we will continue to see. The second is interesting in the U.S. is always packaging sizes in terms of retail environments. And consumer purchasing habits, you will see more of that as the year unfolds. And most importantly, trial-generating devices, we know the repeat rate of the businesses is high. We know that it takes over two years to build your trial curve and we will continue to be putting money behind that. So we have a great product. We can add to the product and we\u2019ll be focusing on building trial. In terms of Japan -- no, we don\u2019t breakout at the country level. Suffice to say on Japan, I think it was Ali on the last call was questioning the trajectory of that business. We\u2019ve had some folk in Japan only a couple of weeks ago. We\u2019re going through a thorough review of that business and there is confidence I would express that notwithstanding the pull forward, that we have our Japanese business now for Hills on a solid footing and a positive underlying trajectory and we will see that in the coming quarters. Operator : And that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Ian Cook : Thanks, Nancy. Well, thanks all of you for your interest in the company and your questions. And thank you to the Colgate world for delivering the results that allow the questions. Operator : That does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation.",

Now for the opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Bina Thompson. Please go ahead, Bina. Bina H. Thompson: Thank you, Angela. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, President, Chairman and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. We're happy to report another quarter of good organic sales growth with every division participating. Consistent with other companies in our industry, we are facing increased macroeconomic pressure in certain areas of the world. Category growth has slowed somewhat in geographies such as Asia, a factor which we actually referenced last quarter. On the other hand, we see some encouraging signs of slow recovery in some European markets. Competition remains healthy and promotional battles continue. However, our new product pipeline is as full as ever and our commercial investment behind our launches has increased worldwide, a careful balance between media spending and in-store activity, and this has resulted in solid market shares, many categories and geographies and showing positive trends in the most recent periods. Our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track and savings from that are supplementing our ongoing Funding the Growth initiatives, which are as healthy as ever. Both of these contributed to our 20 basis point increase in gross margin. Offsetting these savings were increases in raw and packaging material costs, as well as continued foreign currency transaction pressure. Our 3 business service centers around the world are now up and running, in Warsaw, Mexico City and Mumbai. The hubbing activities are complete in Europe and are well underway elsewhere in the world, which will make us even more nimble and effective winning on the ground. And of course, our balance sheet is strong and cash generation is solid. So let's turn to the divisions, starting with North America. Organic sales growth in North America was modest. The volume growth of 2.5% was of course on top of the very robust increase in the year-ago quarter of 6%, reflecting the initial launch of Colgate Total Mouthwash. We have an exciting innovation launching as we speak, which I'll discuss in a moment. Pleasingly, versus the second quarter of 2013, our 2014 second quarter shares increased in toothpaste, toothbrushes, deodorants, body wash and fabric conditioners, and our mouthwash shares have steadied at about 6.5%. Trial and repeat numbers for Colgate Total Mouthwash are above previous recent competitive launches and the product has been instrumental in driving overall category growth. Our recent launch of Suavitel Fast Dry fabric conditioner has also met with success. Our quarterly national share is at a record 18.6%, up 170 basis points versus the second quarter of 2013. And this is a product which is largely sold in Hispanic markets, where it holds a 36.2% share on a year-to-date basis, fast closing the gap between us and the leading competitor. So looking ahead, our latest toothpaste innovation here in the U.S. is Colgate enamel health toothpaste. The enamel strengthening segment is the fastest-growing in the toothpaste category, with 54% of consumers concerned about enamel. This new product replenishes natural calcium and other minerals back into weakened enamel, filling in rough spots while at the same time, polishing the enamel surface so germs are less likely to stick on the teeth. The formula has an active fluoride system, along with gentle on enamel silica and the product comes in 2 variance, whitening and sensitivity relief. In addition, the impact for packaging is interactive with a touch-and-feel demo showing acid soft in rough enamel and healthy smooth enamel. So as you would imagine, we have a very robust integrated marketing campaign planned, including television, print, public relations, professional, digital, social, mobile and in-store activities. Turning to Europe/South Pacific. We're very encouraged with our progress in Europe and are cautiously optimistic that some of the macroeconomic headwinds we have been facing are beginning to die down. Our organic sales growth of 2.5% reflects the balance between volume and price where we have had strong promotional activities across the region to support new product launches. And this has paid off in terms of market share. Our Oral Care shares are strong across the category and is showing good momentum in toothpaste. Our year-to-date market share is at 35.2%, up 70 basis points from the year-ago period, with the most recent share at 35.4%. And of particular note is the U.K. where despite an ongoing competitive battle, our year-to-date share is just shy of 50%, up a full point with the most recent lead over 51%, a record high. In manual toothbrushes, our year-to-date regional share is up 90 basis points to 23.5%, with the most recent lead at 24%, consolidating our #1 position. And this was in part fueled by excellent progress in the U.K. where we've achieved a record 37.5% share year-to-date. And in mouthwash, our share is up 10 basis points to 16.4% on a year-to-date basis, with the most recent lead at 16.9%. We're very excited about the launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer across Europe and the South Pacific. First quarter launches in Australia and Norway have achieved 3.7% and 3.5% shares, respectively, in the most recent period. We've only just launched in the U.K. where, as I mentioned, we are reaching record market share levels and we'll introduce the product across the Rest of Europe in the balance of the year. In Germany, where our share is up 140 basis points to 41.2% on a year-to-date basis, we've launched it under the elmex brand. More new products are planned for the second half of this year as well. We'll continue the rollout of Colgate Max White One Optic. Whitening is the second-biggest segment in toothpaste in Europe and we hold the #1 position. Similarly, in manual toothbrushes, we will continue the rollout of Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal toothbrush, a product which, as you know, was developed in Asia but is met with great success in other parts of the world. And innovation in the mouthwash category is Colgate Plax Deep Clean mouthwash, which provides a deep effective clean even in hard-to-reach areas. The product contains 2 natural ingredients, eucalyptol and propolis, that are well known to the consumer. Eucalyptus is known for cooling and antibacterial properties and propolis for its protective properties. Turning then to Latin America. We're very pleased with the continued strong organic sales growth in this region. This growth was broadly based. One exception was Brazil, where our consumers were glued to their televisions during the World Cup and not spending time in stores, a temporary condition which we expect should reverse itself in the second half of this year. Market shares continue to climb. In the press release, we cited record toothpaste shares in a number of countries. Our year-to-date manual toothbrush shares also achieved record highs in Brazil, Chile, Peru, Puerto Rico and Uruguay. In Brazil, Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpaste has achieved a 2.3% share year-to-date, lifting our overall share to a record 71.9%. In Mexico, our toothpaste share has been over 80% for the last 3 months, and while we don't have readings yet in national Nielsen shares, Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpaste in Mexico has registered a 3 point share in ScanTrack. And as in other regions around the world, the launch of Colgate Slim Soft toothbrush has met with success in Latin America. In Brazil, our share is up 80 basis points to 32.8% year-to-date on the strength of both Colgate 360\u00ba and Colgate Slim Soft, both of which are superpremium priced, helping to increase margins. In Mexico, our manual toothbrush leadership share climbed to a record 44.9% in the most recent period. And our mouthwash share across the region is up 30 basis points to 36.3%, while our principal competitor is down almost a full point to 38.8%. In the Personal Care category, we've increased our underarm share in Mexico as a result of new products such as Men's and Lady Speed Stick stress. We're now the leader in bar soaps across Latin America with Protex and Palmolive holding the #1 and 2 positions, respectively. And in fabric conditioners, our regional share is up over 2 points to 50.8% year-to-date, with the most recent lead at 51%. And more innovation is planned for the second half. During the third quarter, we will be launching Colgate Total Professional Breath Health toothpaste. Dentists advise their patients that bad breath can be caused not just by food odors, but also by the accumulation of bacteria in the mouth. This breath-freshening toothpaste formula with breakthrough neutral odor technology is scientifically proven to fight and neutralize bad breath-causing bacteria. Next month, we are introducing Colgate Luminous White Instant toothpaste. Its exclusive formula with optic brighteners activates while you brush for a visibly whiter smile instantly. And in the Personal Care category, this month, we're launching Lady Speed Stick Aclarado Perfecto with Vitamin E. Its formula was, with Vitamin E and pearl extract, was perceived in a consumer test to help restore the skin's natural tone, while also providing sweat protection for up to 48 hours. Turning then to Asia. While organic sales growth in this region slowed from the first quarter pace, this quarter was compared to the strongest quarter of last year, which saw organic sales growth at a very strong 13%. Macroeconomic factors in China affected our results, and we told you on our last call about some categories slowing and, in fact, that did happen. However, as referenced in the press release, we continued to see strong growth in other countries in the region, such as India, and innovation continues to help drive market share increases. In toothpaste, our market share in India is up 70 basis points on a year-to-date basis to 54.8%, with the most recent period at 55.1% and this in the face of recent competitive entries. The revitalization of Colgate Active Salt, a toothpaste with a unique salt formula that gives deep clean feeling and helps fight germs for strong teeth and healthy gums, helps drive these results. In Malaysia, our share increased 50 basis points to 73.5% year-to-date, with the most recent lead at 74.5%. This was our first Asian market to launch Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpaste. And in just 6 months, it's achieved almost a 4% share of the market. Our toothbrush share across the division is up to 30.6% year-to-date, fueled by increases in India, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan. In India, new product such as Colgate Super Flexi have resulted in an increase of 240 basis points to 43.5% year-to-date, with the most recent lead at 43.7%. Our mouthwash business is solid as well, with a regional share year-to-date of 21.8%, up 110 basis points. Colgate Plax Jasmine Tea, a mouthwash which provides long-lasting fresh breath with a pleasant jasmine tea flavor, has contributed to very good results in Thailand and the Philippines, where total mouthwash shares are up year-over-year 170 basis points and 380 basis points, respectively. Colgate Plax Herbal Salt mouthwash, which was launched in Malaysia and Singapore and contributed 80 basis points and 250 basis points, respectively, in the initial lead, will launch in India as Colgate Plax Active Salt during the fourth quarter. As you may know, the Indian consumer habit is to rinse one's mouth with salt water, so this innovation should resonate well in this market. Of course, more innovation is planned for the second half of this year. We will continue to roll out Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpaste. In China, we'll be launching Colgate Tea health toothpaste, which provides refreshing breath with a pleasant longjing tea flavor. Longjing is a popular and premium type of tea in China, which is associated with multiple types of benefits, including healthy teeth and refreshing breath. We will also be launching the Colgate HT1 toothbrush, with 7-way cleaning, with the following benefits : Cleans teeth surface, removes bacteria, is gentles on gums, cleans in between the teeth, absorbs brushing pressure and is easy to maneuver. And in Thailand, we will be launching Colgate Plax Tartar Control mouthwash, an exciting addition to our strong mouthwash portfolio in that country. This mouthwash provides the dual benefit of tartar control and breath freshening all at once. Turning then to Africa/Eurasia. We're encouraged with the continued solid organic sales growth in this region. Of particular note was Russia, where despite an uncertain political and macroeconomic environment, new products such as Colgate Altai Herbs toothpaste, Colgate Total interdental toothpaste and Colgate Optic White Instant toothpaste helped drive strong growth. Toothpaste and toothbrush shares remained solid across the region. Innovation in the mouthwash category has delivered good share results. In Russia, we told you last quarter about Colgate Altai Herbs mouthwash, which contains an ingredient well known to the local consumer, a comparison product -- companion product to the previously mentioned toothpaste. Our mouthwash share in Russia is up year-to-date 170 basis points to 27.5%. In Turkey, our newly launched Colgate Plax Green mouthwash has resulted in a market share increase of 120 basis points to 20.5% year-to-date. And we're also very pleased with the continued success in our shower gel business across the region, where we hold a leadership position of 22%, up almost 2 full point\u2019s year-over-year. Palmolive Gourmet Spa has driven increases of 220 basis points and 400 basis points in Russia and Turkey, respectively. And the recent launch of Palmolive Thermal Skin Renewal resulted in an increase of 5 points in South Africa. More innovation is planned. In the Eurasian markets, we are introducing Colgate Total Pro Whitening toothpaste. And here, as elsewhere, the premium price whitening segment is very important to the overall toothpaste category. In Russia, consumers believe in the power of natural ingredients and traditional recipes to improve oral health. Accordingly, we're launching the Colgate Natural Extracts toothbrush, containing pine tree bristles, with premium differentiated and impactful packaging designed to stand out on shelf. As I mentioned earlier, our Palmolive Gourmet Spa line of shower gels has been very successful, and we hope to build on that success with 2 new variants to be added to the existing chocolate, vanilla and strawberry. The new creamy coffee and peach sorbet variants are infused with natural extracts and their creamy formulas smooths the skin. As you would expect, we will have a very strong integrated marketing campaign to support this launch. Then turning to Hill's. Hill's business continues to be solid. General softness in the pet superstores has been affecting us and others as well here in the U.S. However, we're encouraged by our continued stream of innovation, which we expect to drive growth going forward. Our rollout of Hill's Ideal Balance continues to meet with success. Here in the U.S., our share of the naturals category continues to grow. And in addition to the regular Ideal Balance, we launched Ideal Balance Slim & Healthy in the second quarter for both dogs and cats. Support activities included features and coupon brochure handouts, brand ambassador coupons and nutritional consultant coupons. In Europe, we launched in the U.K. and Germany in April and May, respectively. And so far, we've seen very good trade acceptance, with listing in the major accounts supported by promotional activities, as well as secondary placements. In the store, we activated with branded gondola ends, demonstrators in key accounts and indoor and outdoor posters and point-of-sale materials. And in addition, we featured the product at consumer pet shows and through testimonial campaigns. On the therapeutic side of the business, our 2013 launch of Prescription Diet metabolic continues to do well both here and abroad. In the U.S., our sales are exceeding our expectations. Our commercial support includes before and after imagery, along with videos online. And this quarter, we've globally launched an antioxidant upgrade to the product. In greater Europe, we've widened the gap between our nearest competitor from 2 points to 8, establishing a clear leadership share of 47% year-to-date in the weight category. Another important therapeutic category is feline urinary, a category where we were underrepresented until the launch of Prescription Diet c/d. New platforms such as efficacy, stress, ocean fish and stew were added in the second quarter here in the U.S., all supported with in-clinic sampling and messaging at professional conferences. Similar activities in Europe have resulted in a 130 basis point increase in our share of the category to almost 30% year-to-date. Looking forward, this quarter, we will continue the rollout of Ideal Balance Slim & Healthy and Science Diet Perfect Weight, our new wellness weight-loss products in markets outside the U.S. And for the fourth quarter, we have more exciting news, which we will share with you soon. So in summary, we're pleased that we continue to drive organic sales around the world with good bottom line growth. Our new product pipeline is as full as ever and our market shares are healthy and growing in many regions. Colgate people everywhere are working hard to keep us winning on the ground. We look forward to sharing our results with you as we go forward through the balance of the year. And now before with turn it over to Q&A, Ian would like to make a few remarks. Ian? Ian M. Cook: Thanks, Bina. Many of you may remember that on the first quarter call, as we began the Q&A, I took the time to make some preliminary remarks on the shape of this year and it seems appropriate to open by doing the same in this quarter. Clearly, we saw a slowdown in the top line pace of the company in the second quarter, and that really began towards the very end of the quarter. And as you break that down, one contributing factor is further emerging market weakness in our categories as we see the macro economic weaknesses finally come more sharply to our categories. You will recall on the first quarter call that we revised the category growth rates for the emerging markets down to a 5% to 7% range from the previous 6% to 8%. And based on what we saw in the second quarter, we see for the balance of the year those emerging markets still posting good growth but at the lower end of that range. In the developed markets, for the Colgate businesses, category growth continues at 1% to 2%, with some growing optimism, I would say, in Europe. Hill's, as you heard, experienced channel-specific slowdown here in the U.S., which we are already seeing recover as this quarter begins. As you heard very clearly from Bina, our market shares around the world continue to be strong and accelerating in Mexico and the U.S., 2 particular geographies that we were focusing on since the beginning of the year. And our innovation pipeline is deep and rich, not just for the balance of 2014 but into 2015 as well. We continue to feel that the strategy we have been deploying for several years, a strategy that focuses on building brands with our consumers, creating innovation that drives growth, maintaining the efficiency and effectiveness that funds that growth and developing a cadre of leadership to continue to manage the company, continue to be the right strategy, as does our execution on the fundamentals of our business around the world. We believe both remain correct, and that is what we are redoubling our focus on for the balance of this year. So with that as a backdrop, while we continue to expect organic growth for the company this year to be in that 5% to 7% range, albeit towards the lower end of that range given the current world environment. On the material cost side, we have seen further increases in material costs, including topical oils and several of the agricultural commodities that affect the Hill's business and, of course, the continued transaction headwinds due to foreign exchange. And because of that, we now see gross margin expectations for the year move to a 30 to 50 basis point range, with Funding the Growth maintained at historically strong levels, as you will see when I go through the gross margin roll forward and, of course, more pricing across the balance of the year. Behind that strong innovation stream, advertising and the increasingly important commercial investment of in-store work will both be up. The restructuring program remains on track, and we continue to expect after-tax savings of between $90 million and $110 million, and that tax rate, as you would expect, remains in the 31% to 32% range. As you saw in the press release, we remain comfortable with our 4% to 5% dollar EPS range and you may recall the walk-through that we provided on our first quarter call, which guided to the middle of that range guidance that I would reiterate. So in summary, we believe the strategy that we are deploying and the focus on the fundamentals that we have remain the right ones. Our market shares are strong. Our innovation is robust, and I think we can continue to demonstrate the agility and the flexibility to react to the volatile world that we are all doing business in. So with those as introductory remarks, Angela, perhaps we could now open the lines to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will now go to Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I guess a couple of things. There's a lot there, Ian, in your final comments. But in terms of the macro slowdown, I think you commented that it happened very late in the second quarter and I guess that concerns me because outside of Brazil, every region saw I think a deceleration in your organic sales growth and at least came in below my expectations. And I have a hard time believing that, that all happened very late in the quarter. And in terms of kind of going forward from here, how quickly do you expect a pickup? How quickly do you expect a reacceleration? I guess, specifically, with regard to pricing and what you mentioned about commodity inflation, how quickly can you put some pricing in place so that even that tempered top line growth outlook is achievable at this point? Ian M. Cook: Yes. Well, obviously, Wendy, that is why I tried to make the introductory remarks because clearly, from the early notes, those are exactly the questions on people's minds. If you track through the organic and focus on the emerging markets, we were actually quite pleased with the organic growth that we sustained in Latin America. The big variation, of course, is in Asia. And clearly, the world macros out there have been volatile and weak in some cases for a time. But beyond the adjustment we made in the first quarter, we had not seen that come through to our categories and it did so in the second quarter and it did late in the second quarter. The other factor, as I mentioned, was related to Hill's. And as I just said in my remarks, we've already seen that -- Hill's bounce back. The important point to make is that the underlying category growths are in that mid-single-digit range, as I said. What you get from a volume point of view is that in large geographies, like a China for example, with a very complex distribution system, you get an inventory reaction that works its way through the system that has a short-term impact. That was the impact we felt in the second quarter as we look forward at the consumption rates, in other words, the consumer purchase rates with them in the mid-single-digits area. And with the pricing plans we have clearly in place for the second half of the year, we feel comfortable with that more tempered organic volume growth for the entire company at the lower end of that 5% to 7% range. So it's the underlying consumer purchasing that gives us confidence. Operator : And we will now go to Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Ian, you're now expecting sales at the low end of where you were, gross margins moving a little bit lower. Maybe you can just walk us through a couple of the offsets that help you keep EPS sort of the midpoint of where you were still intact? Ian M. Cook: Well, we obviously have the restructuring program, which we have underway. I talked about advertising for the year. As I said, the total commercial spend will be up and the advertising will be up on the year on a ratio basis. It will be more in line with the strong levels of last year. And when you work all of that through, with the guidance we provided in the first quarter on the EPS that brings in the year. Operator : And we will now go to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : So it's a little -- I mean, I think it's unusual, Ian, for you to do one of these prepared remarks. I'm just trying to figure out the severity of things. Was it really that bad of a slowdown in the emerging markets? And even if it is, you've historically been relatively immune to slowdowns as we've seen in the past. I wanted to know, you think that's changed for your business? Or is that much worse? In that context, secondarily, if you could talk about the double-digit constant currency earnings target for this year. It sounds like you're not going to make that. I just want confirmation of that. And if it changes your view, given what you're seeing in the emerging markets right now, about this company being a double-digit earnings company over the next few years. Ian M. Cook: Okay. So to answer your second question, the growth this year is not double digits. So I confirm that in a constant currency basis. But it does not change our view, our strategic view, that for the longer term, this is a double-digit earnings company. As far as your comment on the prepared remarks and the slowdown on the top line, frankly, the only reason we elected to do it this way was because otherwise what you do is you usurp somebody's question in order to make some opening comments, which seemed unfair. So we simply thought it was cleaner to do it this way. So I apologize if trying to be proper in the presentation created a sense that things were somehow bad, which we do not believe they are. We do see a volatile world. We have tried consistently in that volatile world to deliver the agility and the flexibility necessary to keep driving our business ahead of the market growth, which is why Bina spent so much time on the market shares, because our market shares are strong and growing in key markets. So this is us just reacting to a deceleration in our marketplaces in order to outperform what we see now as the probable growth rate in our categories for the balance of this year. And we just wanted to be as clear as possible about that. Operator : And we will now go to Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Ian, can you discuss your market share performance so far for the SAC anti-cavity toothpaste where it's been launched and incrementality to your business? And then also on a related note, given the healthy innovation pipeline you pointed to, do you think you're investing enough in marketing here or will you temper the marketing a bit given the top line dynamics out there? Ian M. Cook: Yes. I think Bina went through quite a few. In fact, almost all of the market shares we have so far on superior anti-cavity. And indeed, it has been predominantly incremental in the marketplaces we have gone to. So you're seeing share performance, I would say, in broad terms, depending on when the markets were entered, between 1.5% and 5% Turkey, 1.5% Brazil, as Bina quoted, Malaysia, 4%; Australia, 4%; New Zealand, approaching 5%; Greece, over 2%; Norway, 3.5%, as Bina said; and Mexico, 3%, albeit that, that is ScanTrack data. And you heard that the Mexico shares are back up over 80 and the Brazil share is at an all-time high of 72. So the more important breeding for us on superior anti-cavity, frankly, is that the trial rate is building very, very nicely. We have now 6 months data in, and it is significantly ahead of the category average and the repeat rates are dead in line with premium category entries in the category. So we're seeing it in the share. But more importantly, we're seeing it in the consumer behavior. And on the support behind the new products, no, the levels of advertising spend, and I'm now talking the traditional below-the-line advertising, are at compared to our history, elevated levels. They're in line with the strong levels we had last year. They are clearly focused behind the innovation in terms of building awareness, getting recommendation. And we keep trying to stress this point, but it sometimes is difficult, I guess, to make the impression that part of our investment to build brands with consumers and generate trial of new products comes in activity that we do at the store level, and that activity is captured in trade spending. So it doesn't go into the traditional advertising line. But when you think of consumer purchasing behavior and the techniques available to you today at retail, it's an enormously important part of building brand and provoking trial purchase. So we're managing very carefully between those 2 investment buckets, the traditional advertising and the overall commercial spending, to make sure, the example I just gave on superior anti-cavity, that we're generating trial above category norms so the repeat multiplies on a higher than normal trial base. So the answer is, we continue to believe we have a very well balanced plan behind the innovation for the year. Operator : And we will now go to Alice Longley with Buckingham Research Brokerage. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : With your guidance for the year that organic sales growth will be at the lower end of 5% to 7%, it looks like you have to get some acceleration from the 4% in the second quarter to get there. And you already talked about Hill's. Where else might we see some improvement, maybe Latin America because people won't be so glued to their TV sets and maybe the U.S. on innovation. But if you could just tell us more where we get improvement in the second half versus the second quarter that would be good. Ian M. Cook: Well, first, Alice, I would say that the prevailing rate you have to get to in the second half is pretty much what you would have delivered in the first half. So yes, there is the second quarter 4%. And as we look at the balance of the year, given the underlying consumption rate that I mentioned in the emerging markets and, particularly, in Asia, that would clearly be a business area where we would expect the organic growth to come back. And as I commented on the Hill's business with the specific channel issue in the second quarter which we're already seeing come back, we would expect to see that in Hill's as well. So if you were pointing to 2 particular areas, it would be those areas. And who knows, we may get wild optimism in Europe. Operator : And we will now go to Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I guess the question is, how do you -- how does your new view on the category growth dynamic affect your decisions on pricing, if at all, all right? Because I know at least one of your major global competitors has said that competitive levels in the markets are affecting their ability to price for currency. You said that you expect more pricing in the back half. But how does that work for you guys? Would you now take less pricing than you would've thought than before? Ian M. Cook: Well, remember, Chris, when you think about pricing, what you're actually trying to do is to get the average selling price up. So there are many ways of doing that. List price is clearly part of it. But there are many other techniques that we deploy strategically and tactically to elevate the ASP, premiumization, changes in your promotional activity. So there are many techniques that we deploy. And the reason we made the comment about the market shares in Mexico and the U.S. is, we got 1.5 pricing on the quarter and we have those market shares moving in the right direction. Bina went through a whole host of other market shares that are moving in the right direction. And we think we have the ability to continue to take pricing, create pricing in the second half of the year without impinging on that mid-single-digit organic growth rate. And innovation is an important part of that. Operator : And we will now go to Bill Chappell with SunTrust. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Ian, just kind of talking about capital allocation and looking with where the stock is today and going forward. I mean, is the EPS guidance, I assume, just assumes only the kind of $3 million a quarter share repurchase. But would you look at deploying more in this environment and from -- or are there other things out there that you're looking that have a better return at this point? Ian M. Cook: Well, that's a very broad question, Bill. I guess the way we have thought about capital allocation over the years, obviously, one pays the dividend. Obviously, one has internal capital expenditure programs, which deliver consistently, in our case, beyond a 33% hurdle rate of return. And of course, that capital investment is elevated in periods when we go through restructuring. So right now, we're deploying a little bit more in capital expenditure than we have done historically quite purposely. And then of course, we buy back shares, as we have done, and I would say our target is still in that $1.5 billion gross range for this year. And obviously, should an acquisition candidate present itself or should we find one in various parts of the world, then we would prefer to allocate the capital in that direction. And I don't think, at least, so far, our thinking has changed in that regard. Operator : And we will now go to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I don't know, probably a tough question to answer, but did you figure out like what is the source of the volume shortfall? I mean, is it people buying less? Is it fewer people in the category? Is it sort of the mix mechanisms you've used in the past aren't work as effectively? Is there any way to kind of triangulate those 3? Ian M. Cook: Yes. I -- it's difficult, Bill. As we have, over time, got under the hood of that, you see what people do is they exhaust their own personal pantries. They literally try and squeeze the tube and make it last a little bit longer so that they can extend the time between purchase cycles. And as we have seen, sometimes, for cash outlay reasons, instead of buying a bigger tube at a certain channel of trade, they will go and buy a smaller tube in a different channel outlet. So in terms of the consumer purchase that is what we have historically seen has been the behaviors they adopt. The direct correlation to volume, and the point I was trying to make specific to Asia on this quarter is, from a selling in volume point of view, you then have the dislocation that, that slowdown brings to a very complicated and interrelated distribution network, which sees some inventory adjustment, which is a short-term effect as everybody readjusts to the now lower consumer purchasing rate. So you see it more sharply on the company volume in the short term, even though the underlying purchase that you will go back to, as I said, is still in that mid-single-digit range. Operator : And we will now go to John Faucher with JPMorgan. John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : A little bit of a follow-up on Chris' question. If we look at your pricing in Latin America and, it's a lot lower than what we're seeing from a lot of these other companies. I'm not asking you to comment on their pricing as much, but can you talk about sort of how you're viewing sort of real pricing in Latin America as we look forward? And is this something where you're just not going to move as much relative to some of the FX pieces? And then sort of further delving down into Venezuela on this, we have seen some companies talk about the margin caps, et cetera. Can you talk about sort of where you feel you are from a margin standpoint in Venezuela and if we look to map that out ourselves. Ian M. Cook: Yes. Well, let me start with Venezuela. We've read all of the transcripts on the pricing caps, obviously, in Venezuela. In our situation, virtually all of our business is capped, if you will, by the government's 2012 policy that prevents us from taking pricing in the marketplace. And therefore, because of that, the pricing cap doesn't really apply to us -- margin cap, I mean. So that would be the simple summary on Venezuela. You probably saw or you will see that we posted a modest profit this quarter and, indeed, for the half, which we had not done last quarter, which is pleasing, and we continue to manage that business with the diligence that you would expect. And there have been quite a few press reports and, indeed, we are in very constructive discussion with the government about the opportunity for us to realize pricing on products as we continue forward in this year, and we'll have to see where that ends up. But we do spend a lot of constructive time in discussion. In terms of pricing in Latin America, actually, we're quite pleased with the pricing balance that we have been taking in Latin America at this time, remembering that there is no pricing in Venezuela. So the overall pricing we're taking, we think, is both consistent. You look at the first and the second quarter, 6 and 5. And of course, that will continue in the back half of the year. And of course, for our gross margin to improve across the year, we will have to see a light gross margin improvement in divisions, including in Latin America, so that is very much in our plan. And I think the market shares talk to the fact that I think we're finding the right balance between the 2. Operator : And we will now go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : You talked a lot about increased in-store activity, but obviously volume was a little bit light of expectations. So do your analytics suggest that consumers are just not as responsive to in-store activity as they used to be? Or was it effective and volume would have been worse if not for the promotional activity? And then also, it sounds like you're quite pleased with the Funding the Growth and cost saves progress overall. So what drove overhead up this quarter? Ian M. Cook: The -- okay, a couple of answers then. In terms of in-store activity, again, as I try to example, I think you have to try and separate out, depending on the part of the world you're talking about, the slowdown in overall consumption and the short-term impact that has on company volume. So as I described before, you can have a situation where as the consumer consumption slows overall, you're still connecting with that consumer, let's pick the emerging market mid-single-digit growth rate now that we are talking about. But behind that, given the distribution system, as the volume readjusts to that lower level, you see company volumes slow in a shorter timeframe. The consumer is just as responsive at the purchasing end to the in-store trial activity. So the in-store activity continues to be effective from a consumption point of view. And in terms of the overhead increase, it largely relates to distribution decisions we have taken in various parts of the world, either to take our products to market directly and not through a distributor, or to extend our distribution depth and, therefore, incur more logistic cost in order to get that distribution depth, both of those things being good in terms of building our brands over the medium term. So very conscious choices. The underlying overhead is actually flat. Operator : And we will now go to Michael Steib with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Michael Steib - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Can I ask a question, just a follow-up question on the Latin American margin, please, it was down over 20 basis points in the quarter. Given your comments on sort of the temporary effect on Brazil volumes in the quarter but also pricing, do you expect to be able to reverse that in the second half, at least partially? Ian M. Cook: Yes. I mean, as I was trying to explain a little bit before, obviously, when you look at the impact in the second quarter, a part of it is Venezuela and part of it is the lead lag between the very sharp increase in transaction impact on product cost and the ability to keep feathering pricing into the marketplace. So as I tried to answer with the earlier question, we do have more pricing planned for the balance of the year. And as we look at our gross margin ambitions for the company, that will see gross margins expand in our divisions, including in Latin America. So to your point, we will indeed see improvement in gross margin as the year unfolds in Latin America, as indeed we saw improvement second quarter to first. Operator : And we will now go to Caroline Levy with CLSA. Brian Doyle - CLSA Limited, Research Division : This is Brian Doyle in for Caroline. We were just wondering how long destocking usually lasts and if it is limited to China at the moment or if there are other areas where it's affecting you? Ian M. Cook: It's predominantly China. It tends to be relatively short term. I would say, overall, 60 to 90 days. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets. Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I know it's a small market for you, but this morning, there are headlines that Argentina is defaulting. What impact would that have on you? Ian M. Cook: Yes. Don't cry for me, Argentina. Argentina, as you may know, Connie, is less than 1% of the company sales. We manage these geographies as if they are a hyperinflationary, so we do all the things even though we don't book it as hyper because it has not yet crossed the 100. So we hold little cash. We have de minimis cash in Argentina. We don't have any debt outstanding, and we don't believe we have a need for any external funding. We make most of our product locally. So as a direct impact of the default, no impact for us. Now of course, what the knock-on effects are in terms of inflation and foreign exchange, we'll have to see how it unfolds and react accordingly, but I come back to the first point that it is less than 1% of our sales. Operator : And we will now go to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Just 2 quick things, 1 was just following up on the 60 to 90 days for how long the destocking usually lasts. You said some of the weakness popped up at the end of the quarter, so should I interpret that as there's still a little bit more to go in 3Q or that continues in July but you would expect as you get into August, September, things start to improve? Ian M. Cook: That would be a correct assessment. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. Great. And then the final thing would just be if you could run through the gross margin bridge for us that would be great. Ian M. Cook: I thought you'd never ask. So in terms of gross profit, prior year gross profit was 58.6%. With the pricing we took, we got 50 basis points from that. Between our Funding the Growth savings and the modest contribution as in the first quarter from restructuring, our total Funding the Growth in restructuring was 220 basis points, actually slightly ahead of the 210 we got in the prior year. Material prices were a headwind of 2 50. And so with the pricing and the Funding the Growth, that's what leads you to the 58.8% or 20 basis point increase year-on-year. Operator : And we will now go to Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: Question, I don't think that you clarify the situation with Hill's in the specialty stores. If you can elaborate what was this temporary dislocation. And you mentioned that it was resolved, but I'm just curious if you can tell us what happened there. And then on pricing again, shall we expect pricing to improve in emerging markets or is just a reduction of promotional activity in Europe given the strong volumes? Ian M. Cook: To answer your latter point, first, Javier, no, it is not a reduction in promotion in Europe, which drives that. It is pricing and it is pricing across the world with a heavy emphasis on the emerging markets and continued emphasis on Hill's. And in terms of Hill's, I'm sorry if I made it sound like some sort of untoward event, they had a traffic slowdown in their stores. And as we have come into this quarter, with our innovation and with the activity we have behind our innovation, that, for us, has gone away and we have kicked off to a nice start in the third quarter. So just a temporary blip. Operator : And we will now go to Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Ian, I was wondering if you could just break apart the drivers of the change in your gross margin outlook between January and July, really I guess between April and July? How much of the reduction has been driven by a decision to move demand building dollars from ad spend to trade spend versus some of the other factors you mentioned like FX, commodity inflation, the general slowdown that you experience, et cetera? That would help. Ian M. Cook: Yes. I don't really want to get into that sort of level of detail. And I would say, in terms of rebuilding our gross margin, it's basically between the materials and the transactions. So that's where our focus is. Operator : And we will now go to Alec Patterson with AGI. Alec Patterson : Ian, I need to follow up on that last question. Just trying to understand, you're saying that material costs, are the material -- is the main change versus where you were in April? Or is it more a function of promo spending that's up to offset, I presume, increased pressure on the categories, especially in emerging markets? Ian M. Cook: Well, clearly, when you do the investment at store, that investment at store brings pressure on gross margin. But we have had that thinking in our plan. So the new aspect is an increase in material prices and, a, shall we say, heightened impact from transaction. Operator : And we will take our final question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Curious on your thoughts on Hill's given the slowdown you talked about in the specialty stores. Do you think there's an opportunity to expand distribution and is there even a benefit in doing so beyond just that channel? And then just more broadly curious, your thoughts on growth rates in that business or in Pet Nutrition sort of broadly in Europe, U.S. and sort of your views on longer-term opportunity in developing markets is something that eventually will be bigger than it is today? Ian M. Cook: Yes. The answer to the distribution question, which has been asked many times, is given the model we have for that business, we do not believe that, that would be to advantage but rather the recommendation we cultivate with veterinary professionals is best maintained in a controlled environment, whether it's a pet store, a PetSmart or a PETCO, where the assistants can advise or indeed directly with the vet. That is part of the connection that brand has with the consumer. If you were then to liberalize that and take it more broadly into, if you will, a grab-and-go environment, you lose that connection. To your second point, you are absolutely right, Hill's today is predominantly a developed world business. We have a very clear focus on a handful of emerging markets where we are seeing a most immediate potential for that growth. But indeed, part of the attractiveness of the business is the long runway we see in terms of emerging markets coming into the fold and providing sustainable growth for the long term. So those are all the questions for today. I thank everyone very much for joining. I thank all the Colgate people for contributing so hard to the results that we deliver. And we look forward to catching up with everybody again after the third quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Bina Thompson. Please go ahead, Bina. Delia H. Thompson: Thanks, Rochelle, and good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2014 earnings release conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. And we're pleased to have reported another quarter of solid organic sales growth. As we all know, business conditions around the world are challenging. We, as others, have seen slowing growth in the emerging markets and continued heightened competitive activity in the developed markets. And the dollar has continued to strengthen in the face of economic uncertainty worldwide. And any economic recovery in the developed markets is muted and tentative at best. However, we think, our focused strategies still serve us well and are well-understood by all our people who are intent on winning on the ground. Innovation is as important as ever and you'll hear not only how new products have helped increase market shares but about more new products slated for the balance of the year. While a strong dollar along with higher material prices has resulted in a modest growth margin decline in the quarter, we continue to believe we will see gross margin expansion over the long term. Our Funding the Growth program is as robust as ever and is expected to deliver full year savings at or above our goal. And while our reported advertising is down as a percent of sales, if you look at the total bucket of commercial spend, it is up both absolutely and as a percent of sales, as impactful and trial-generating in-store activities have supported our robust new product activity. Our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is proceeding smoothly, and as you saw in this morning's press release, we've expanded the program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities, which we expect will begin to be realized towards the end of 2015 or early 2016. And we're seeing some encouraging trends in the markets of China and Brazil. While both these regions declined for the third quarter as a whole, we saw a reversal toward the end of the quarter, which we believe should bode well going forward. So as I said, a challenging environment, but we think we're well-positioned to meet these challenges going forward. So turning then to North America. Organic sales growth accelerated in North America from the second quarter and market shares are solid. Our excellent performance in manual toothbrushes was highlighted in the press release. One of the drivers was Colgate Optic White Toothbrush and Built-In Whitening Pen. This new product has generated good trial and strong repeat rates, ahead of not only our Colgate Optic White manual toothbrush but a competing brush as well. In the quarter, another significant launch was Colgate Enamel Health toothpaste and Colgate 360\u00b0 Enamel Health toothbrush. While it's early days, results of the toothpaste have been very good. Our national share at the end of September was over 2%, and this result exceeded both historical competitive launches, as well as competitive launches in the third quarter. Importantly, the launch has added incremental share. Our overall U.S. toothpaste share is now 35.8% for the past 4 weeks, up 1 full point versus the year-ago period. This 35.8% share is also ahead of our year-to-date share of 35%. Since the second quarter, consumption growth has been ahead of category growth. In fact, for the past 4 weeks, consumption was up 7.6% versus the category growth of around 2.5%. A relaunch of our Colgate Total Advanced Whitening toothpaste has been accompanied by the launch of Colgate Total Lasting White mouthwash to take advantage of the power of a complete regimen. Colgate Total Lasting White mouthwash has an innovative formula that helps remineralize tooth enamel, prevent stains and fight tartar and has no burn of alcohol. Our overall mouthwash share in the U.S. is now at 6.5% year-to-date, up 120 basis points. To continue this momentum, we're launching Colgate Kids mouthwash. This is an opportunity to reinvigorate the kids mouthwash segment with a brand mothers trust. Distribution of the product is building at key retailers as we speak. Of note also is our share in fabric conditioners. The Suavitel brand is, as you know, largely sold in Hispanic markets and has now reached a record 18% share of the general market year-to-date, up 130 basis points. Innovations such as Suavitel Fast Dry has contributed to this success. Turning then to Europe/South Pacific. This region delivered solid results. Organic sales have increased every quarter this year and this despite ongoing macroeconomic pressures. Innovation continues to be an important driver of our performance. As you know, 1 of the key elements in our global growth and efficiency program is the formation of hubs, and much of the hubbing to date has occurred in Europe. As of July, all European hubs have been implemented. Central Europe West, Central Europe East, Southern Europe, U.K., Nordic and Western Europe. These streamlined operations should further position us to effectively win on the ground. Our oral care market shares are strong. In toothpaste, our regional share is at 35.3% year-to-date, up almost a full point from the year-ago period, with the most recent reading at 35.4%. The results were broad-based with increases in virtually every hub. Our regional manual toothbrush shares are up a full point year-to-date to 23.5%, with the most recent reading at 23.8%. Mouthwash is at 17.9% year-to-date, up from 17.8% in the year-ago period. Our Sanex business is also performing well across its categories, with share increases in body wash, liquid hand soap, bar soap and underarm protection. This year, we relaunched our Sanex body wash, which contains the advanced Dermo Active 3 complex to deliver the 3 key benefits to keep skin healthy, protection, deep moisturization and pH balance. This has helped to strengthen Sanex's credentials in moisturization, and elevate the product's quality perception. We talked last quarter about the rollout of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer, hereafter to be referred to as Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection. And that has continued with the launch of the product in France in September. Italy is scheduled for October, and Central Europe East for November to complete the rollout. A notable performance is in the U.K., where the market share is almost 4% in the latest period. Also in the U.K., we entered the electric toothbrush market 2 years ago. The initial offering, the Colgate ProClinical C350, was at the higher priced end of the market. So this month, we're launching a lower priced version, Colgate ProClinical C250. Around 75% of the market is priced at this price point, so this launch should make us more competitive in the marketplace. Turning then to Latin America. Business is strong across the region and, as referenced in the press release, we continue to maintain strong leadership positions in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes. As elsewhere, the regional rollout of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection is meeting with success. In Brazil, where it has been in market for about 1 year, it has achieved a 2.2% share year-to-date. In Mexico, where it was more recently launched in April, it's achieved a year-to-date share of 1%, with the most recent period at almost 2 points. The product has now been launched in virtually every country, with only Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia and the Caribbean region remaining. Other toothpaste innovations, such as Colgate Total Breath Health and Colgate Luminous White Instant, which we described to you last quarter, are also being rolled out throughout the region. Compelling innovation in manual toothbrushes has resulted in record high leading shares in Brazil, Chile, Puerto Rico, Uruguay and Paraguay. In bar soaps, our market share is up 40 basis points to almost 30% year-to-date. Across the region, Protex and Palmolive hold the #1 and #2 positions, respectively. A steady stream of innovation in this category has helped increase market shares. A recent relaunch is Palmolive Naturals Daily Exfoliation with oats and brown sugar. Consumers know that it is important to exfoliate the skin. Its formula with brown sugar and natural oats provides a gentle exfoliation for beautiful and smooth skin. Turning then to Asia. As noted earlier, we've experienced slowing category growth in inventory correction in China, which has affected overall growth despite a very strong performance in other markets. However, this situation appears to be improving, as we said it would on our last call. Despite the external challenges, we've continued with our innovation program. As elsewhere, Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste is meeting with success. Launched in Malaysia in February of this year, it has now reached almost 4 full share points in the most recent period and has added incremental share. Our toothpaste share is now at 73.5% year-to-date. In India, where our share is up 30 basis points to 54.6% year-to-date, our May launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste has already achieved almost half a share point in the most recent period. And across the region, our manual toothbrush share is up 50 basis points to 30.4% year-to-date. In India, our key brand, Colgate Super Flexi, has driven the overall toothbrush share up 210 basis points to 43.7% year-to-date, with the most recent share at 43.9%, consolidating our leading position. And in mouthwash, our regional share is up 140 basis points to almost 22% year-to-date. Looking forward, we have more innovation to come. One interesting new product planned for launch in China in the fourth quarter is Colgate 360\u00b0 Gold Charcoal toothbrush. As you know, some consumers are very interested in charcoal as an ingredient, but a new trend, which has also emerged with the Chinese consumer is gold. This toothbrush in addition to having gold-colored bristles and charcoal-infused bristles will also have an antibacterial component within the bristles. And in addition, the product should be very impactful on the shelf with its black and gold packaging. Also in the region, we're very excited about our recent acquisition in Myanmar of the laser toothpaste business. Together with Colgate's 20% share, the added 35% share of laser gives us a strong leadership position in this rapidly evolving country. Turning then to Africa/Eurasia. Business remains healthy in this part of the world and we were particularly pleased with the solid volume growth in both Russia and the Ukraine, despite all the political turmoil in that part of the world. Regional toothpaste shares year-to-date are at 32% even with the year-ago period, but our most recent reading is 32.3% and we see good momentum building behind our continued stream of innovation. Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste launched in South Africa a year ago, is just the beginning to be rolled out throughout the rest of the region. And in toothbrushes, we've had excellent results in the South Africa where the share is up 3 points to 37.7% year-to-date, with the most recent read at 38.3%. Similarly, in Turkey, where our year-to-date share is 28.4%, we've seen share momentum in the 2 most recent periods, which share reads of 28.9% for May-June, and 30.5% for July-August. Our regional mouthwash share is up 50 basis points to just over 20% year-to-date, positioning us as the #2 mouthwash brand across Africa/Eurasia. In Russia, we continue to benefit from the launch earlier this year of Colgate Plax Altai Herbs. Our share is up 220 basis points to 27.7% year-to-date. Results for the shower gel category is strong, fueled by our Palmolive Gourmet Spa line. Our year-to-date share is at 22%, up 160 basis points, with almost every country contributing to the positive share and momentum. As elsewhere around the world, innovation will continue. Colgate Total Pro Whitening toothpaste, which provides 12-hour protection for a healthier mouth and whiter teeth, now selling in Russia, Ukraine and Turkey, will be rolled out to additional countries in the region in the fourth quarter and next year. Another pan-regional launch starting this quarter will be Colgate Total Mouthwash, which should help build on our already strong mouthwash business. And in the personal care category, we'll extend our very successful Palmolive Gourmet Spa shower gel line into liquid hand soap. Finally, Hill's. The Hill's business is solid as new product activity across our brands has delivered good results. Hill's Ideal Balance is now selling virtually everywhere in the world. Here in the U.S., both the dog and cat wet and dry products have been well-supported by the super stores. In those channels in the quarter, consumption of Hill's Ideal Balance was up almost 40% versus the year ago period. The launch is going well in Europe as well and is being supported by a fully integrated marketing campaign. Our Hill's Science Diet business in the U.S. is being supported by a Healthier Pet, Happier Lives national campaign, which is focused on preventative care to drive our new Life Care portfolio of diets. For the year-to-date period, our consumption is up 15% in our 2 largest retailers. In the weight category, both the Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic line and the Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight line are doing well. And next quarter, we will be adding a new variant, Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight for small and toy breed dogs, the fastest-growing pet population. The recent global launch of Hill's Prescription Diet CD Multicare Urinary Stress feline, supported by an extensive sampling program and in-clinic feeding trials is also helping drive Hill's therapeutic business. And finally, we're really excited about our latest innovation, Hill's Ideal Balance Crafted, expected to launch next quarter. Capitalizing on the growing trend of the humanization of pets, this superpremium price product offers authentic ingredients prepared the right way with care and is crafted in smaller batches to help lock in the flavor. The unique ingredients such as salmon, fresh vegetable, chickpeas, buckwheat, shroud and herbs are customized for dogs and cats. The compelling packaging reinforces the product's attributes. So in summary, we're pleased that our businesses continue to grow our around the world. Our focused strategies are serving us well. Our new product pipeline is as full as ever, and a broad array of new products launched globally have helped increase our leadership shares in many markets. We are providing our Colgate leaders worldwide with the tools to keep winning on the ground. We look forward to sharing our results with you as we move to the end of the year. And now, Rochelle, we'll turn it over to questions, if we could, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : So first, just a clarity question. What level of organic sales growth and FX impact is implied in your 2015 earnings guidance? And the real question is, Brazil and China, clearly weak in the quarter. Obviously, Bina highlighted that trends improved at the end of the quarter but we had heard some hope. I think, last quarter the Q3 trends would improve, which didn't play out as much. So I just was hoping for a bit of a state of the union on what's causing pressure in Brazil and China, if those factors kind of linger going forward and how much visibility you have here that your business has bottomed in those markets? Ian M. Cook: Yes, thanks, Dara. Well, let me take a little bit of a step back on the world and our categories and include China and Brazil in those comments and then take you forward to 2015. Let me start with the developed world where, I guess, we have been saying for a time that our category growth rates are in the 1% to 2% range, with Europe being at the lower end of that range and the U.S. now creeping up to the higher end of that range and that hasn't really changed. When you then turn to the emerging markets, as we have said on the last couple of calls, we came into the year from a 2013 where the growth rates were between 6% and 8% and said that the growth rates were now likely to be between 5% and 7%. And on the last call, we said that those growth rates had decelerated to the lower end of that range. And what we have seen is that during the third quarter, that has continued to be the case. In other words, those headwinds have not reversed. Now very specific to China, on the last call, we described and explained how the combination of the deceleration in consumer consumption led to a destocking of the extended distribution system in China through distributors and wholesalers and that we thought that would correct itself in response to a question, if I recall, within 60 to 90 days. And somebody said, well, does that mean the China business will come back from a Colgate volume point of view towards the end of the third quarter? Now many of us have just come back from an extended trip to Asia and I'm pleased to say that is precisely what has happened. In other words, while China for the quarter remains modestly negative, what we saw in terms of independent offtake data is consumption at about mid-single digits and the destocking working itself through the system. So as we finished the quarter, our volume was now servicing again that mid-single-digit rate of consumption. And at this point, we would say we expect that to continue. Brazil is China redux except a little bit later. I think, frankly, we were planning for a recovery following the World Cup and that didn't occur. The category growth rates repeated what we saw in China. And the inventory destocking also compounded against that reduced consumer consumption level. And again, as Bina has said, we have begun to see that come back in Brazil, with the category growth rates now in the mid-single digits. But it started a little bit later in Brazil. So it will be a little bit into the fourth quarter before it fully comes back. Pleasingly, in both cases, the consumption, which is to say what consumers are buying, continues to be at that mid-single-digit level. So for 2014, we think it prudent to say, with all of that in the mix, that our view on organic top line growth is now broader. We're saying between 4% and 7% for the year because we think that's prudent. And as we said on the release, we really have just started our 2015 budgeting process. But based on the information we have today, we think it would be prudent to likewise say that our organic growth range for 2015 will be in that 4% to 7% range. Operator : And next, we'll move to Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I guess, Ian, taking that 2015 commentary to EPS, it sounds like, based on where spot rates are today, I think, your '15 EPS preliminary outlook sounds like it would imply your healthy double digit EPS growth into 2015. And I guess, correct that if it's wrong, and if it's not, can you just talk about why you feel that level of confidence, especially with some of the macro trends that are going on out there? Ian M. Cook: Well, in fact, Chris, thanks for the question, the EPS growth rate for next year, we have tried to be quite specific in guiding to mid to high single digits in dollar terms, not double digits. And that reflects the recent foreign exchange deterioration which, as you know, was very sharp and towards the end of the third quarter and when one goes through the various investor notes that have been written about the business, many people have come to a like conclusion in terms of what they see dollar EPS growth being. So as we said in the release, we're expecting another year of growth. And having been asked the question, we would frame it as 4% to 7% organic. We talk about expansion of the gross margin. And as we go through our budget process, you would imagine that our target continues to be that 50 to 100 basis point expansion and mid to high-single digit EPS growth in dollar terms. And that's the way we're framing and approaching 2015. Operator : And next, we'll move to Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Could you talk a little bit more about the non-China markets in Asia because -- I mean, if I'm not mistaken, I think, China's only kind of like 20%, 25% of that region, and for the overall organic sales growth to be up only 1%, it still sounds like there's real weakness in the other markets. I know you called out India as being strong actually. So what else is dragging down the numbers, is it the Philippines or Malaysia, like what else is big enough to move the needle there? Ian M. Cook: That part of the world is heavily influenced by China and India. And when Bina said India was strong, India was strong. And the Southeast Asian countries generally performed very, very well during the quarter. So it really is China and the correction of that Chinese business back to, I stress, this underlying mid-single-digit consumption rate for consumers. Operator : And next, we'll move to Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Again, a couple of questions on what's going on in a few markets. Let's pick up where you left of on the last one on India. India is strong. I guess, the question is what's strong in India? When we look at some of the Nielsen data out of India, it shows volume decelerating throughout the quarter. At least into July, August now reaching almost down 6% for the category for toothpaste specifically. So I guess, where is the offset or is it just potentially a problem with the data? And then, secondly, we've heard Nestle, we've heard Unilever talk about some of the pricing problems or challenges throughout Europe. You've got another quarter reported here of negative price and promotion. So maybe you can comment a little bit more on what you're seeing in terms of the competitive dynamics and pricing environment throughout Europe? Ian M. Cook: Well, let's take India first. Without getting into specifics, we have seen consistent double-digit growth in India every quarter this year. We continue to build their market share on toothpaste and on toothbrushes, our leadership market shares. I would also add by the way, with that independent study that happens every year in India, for the fourth straight year, Colgate was voted the most trusted brand in any category in India, which gives you a sense of the consumer loyalty and affection for the brand. One thing we've been doing for a while in India is expanding the strength of our distribution in the rural areas. And I would venture to say, Jason, that when you start getting to that level of distribution without in any way impugning Nielsen or other data sources, the quality of the data becomes perhaps a little bit suspect. In Europe, actually, we were pleased with Europe. There is no question that pricing has become, for some retailer, in some cases, competitor, and other, an approach, a tactic, I guess, to try and build overall growth. So we were pleased to see the volume growth we had in Europe and indeed the modest organic growth along with good-sized margin -- gross margin expansion delivering goods financial results there. And as Bina said in her comments, and I think we have taken this view for some time now in Europe, I think, we are clear-eyed about the growth rates that can be expected there and we have put an extraordinary focus on reorganizing our European business to make it structurally efficient against a flat line growth rate. And I think, we're seeing the benefits of that. And we're also seeing market shares improve, as Bina mentioned in her prepared remarks. So this hubbing that we have moved to in Europe is working very well for us against 1 of the objectives we had, which was to strengthen our executional capability on the ground. Operator : And next, we'll move to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Can you just talk about the Colgate Total growth in the quarter and if this triclosan nonsense is done? And then, I do have a follow-up. Ian M. Cook: Yes, it was done, Bill, until you raised it. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : No one listens to me I promise. Ian M. Cook: The share is flat. You may have seen Javier's [ph] note where they ran an independent survey, I think, with 2,500 people, which basically suggested that the awareness was vanishingly low. In fact, lower than other ingredients in toothpaste products. And obviously, as you would imagine, we have like tracking data which shows the same thing. So it is a non-issue. Your follow on? William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Ian, I just wanted to ask you, is the destocking all done globally now? And do you think the U.S. is like really pulling out? Some of the data points, it seemed like the U.S. is really starting to accelerate in the last month or so. Ian M. Cook: Yes, let's not get too excited. I think, the U.S. is showing modest acceleration. But these things have tended to be lumpy. But I tried to imply that in my remark on category growth that we are indeed seeing the U.S. upshift towards the higher end of that 2% range. On the destocking, given the vastness of the 2 geographies and the indirect nature of the distribution, China, which we talked about in the second quarter, we believe on the data we see is done, was done by the end of the third quarter. Brazil is on the way to being done and that will be completed during the fourth quarter. There are no other spots of destocking. Operator : And next, we'll move to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : I want to get a better sense of why you believe that you can go back to double-digit dollar base earnings growth long term, because you haven't done in the past 5 years or so, including this year. And I guess, another way to ask the question is what do you need to get back to that target? And if your answer is macro and FX, then how should we all think about your level of defensiveness and indeed the whole industry's level of defensiveness and macro insensitivity versus history? Ian M. Cook: Wow. I haven't finished Picasso's book yet so I'm not sure how to answer the question. I think, Ali, the way to think about it perhaps would be on a relative basis. I mean, I think, for the last several years, we have seen things happening in our world that have been truly unusual and volatile events. Many of them having implications both in terms of consumer purchasing behavior and fundamentally foreign exchange, as people run from risk to perceived safety and they impact companies severely in the short term. So while we return to a better macro environment and a more stable foreign exchange environment, I guess, the way to think about it is on a relative basis. Operator : And next, we'll move to Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Going back to China and Brazil, I guess, one question on China and Brazil and then sort of an unrelated question, if you'll entertain it, on Venezuela. First on, just on the volume declines in China and Brazil, are you able to parse out at all how much of those declines were true unit declines versus negative mix and trade down, because I can see how the unit volumes could reaccelerate substantially and sustainably with inventory rebalancing but a trading down trend or less trade-up anyway might be harder to overcome without macro relief. And then, on Venezuela, it would seem that you're now running the risk of operating at a loss, maybe a material loss in that market with this latest devaluation. Although I know, in your Q, you've got some price relief that's come through, which is good. So I'm trying to balancing those 2 things out. Will Venezuela now be running at a loss? And if so, can you frame for us how far you're willing to go in incurring losses in that market because it's hard to see how things get better before they get worse at least from a currency perspective. Ian M. Cook: Yes, I mean, to answer the Venezuela question first, Steve, we're not running at a loss. I think, Venezuela is about 3% of the company's sales and about 1% of the company's operating profit. And as you rightly observed, I think we mentioned on the last call that we felt we had been in very constructive discussion with the government relative to pricing. And indeed, we were granted pricing basically across our portfolio in Venezuela, which won't actually move to the marketplace meaningfully until the fourth quarter and will modestly improve our position there. So indeed, we view that as a positive, and certainly, we'll not see Venezuela in a loss-making position. In China and Brazil, we run a dollar-weighted volume anyway. From our reporting point of view, when we look at the information we have from independent trade surveys, we can track that, whether you look at volume or value. The destocking, as I said earlier in China, is now through. And we are back to meeting consumption with our shipments. And in Brazil, it is in like fashion working its way through the system and will be completed in the fourth quarter. It really was the distribution system catching up to the succession of consumer slowdowns but that consumer consumption now seems set mid-single digits and now our shipments are coming back to that. Operator : And we'll move on to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Can you talk about what's driving that 50 to 100 basis point gross margin acceleration next year when presumably, FX and raw materials are still a drag, at least in the first half, and it sounds like incremental savings don't start kicking in until later in the year and then maybe this is an opportunity to also give the gross margin bridge for this quarter? Ian M. Cook: I was wondering when somebody would do that. Okay. Let's start with the gross profit roll-forward. So last year, it was 59. In this quarter, we pick up a 50 basis point benefit from pricing. Between the restructuring program and our Funding the Growth savings, we pick up 230 basis points, essentially in line with last year. Material prices sequentially worsened from the 2.5 basis points negative -- 2.5 point negative in the third quarter to 3 and you've got 20 basis points of mix, et cetera, and that brings you to the current year at 58, 640 basis points down. Now if we take that and look forward, first thing to say, our Funding the Growth program remains strong. Secondly, our restructuring program remains strong. Third, given the timing of pricing that we took in the third quarter and the Venezuelan price increases, we are now realizing in the fourth quarter, we expect pricing to be a more significant component of offsetting the material price headwinds. Looking forward, again, we have not finished our budgeting process. But in terms of some of the underlying commodity costs, one would say that there are emerging signs of weakness. And one would also say that in terms of oil, even though there is a lead lag before you get the full benefit of that, we have gone into our budget with a $100 assumption and we know where oil sits today. So it will be a combination of the funding the growth where material prices really end up after we have been through the diligence of our budgeting and pricing. Operator : And Caroline Levy with CLSA will have our next question. Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division : I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on Europe? And there's been some upheaval in the retail environment there. And is any risk of inventories getting stock in the system there and what are the risks you still see going forward in Europe? Ian M. Cook: Yes, I think, the risks are pretty much out there for all to see. I'm not sure retailer-specific will be an issue. I think, I know the retailer to whom you are referring. But we have, in those kind of environment, all sorts of checks and balances in terms of inventory against consumption. And I think it highly unlikely that such a situation would arise in the European environment. Operator : And we'll move on to Connie Maneaty with BMO. Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: A follow-up on Venezuela. Is the pricing you're getting in the fourth quarter, do you view it as a onetime event or do you think the ability to price to offset inflation is coming back? And then, because of the pricing, will the impact of the devaluation in 2015, assuming rates stay the same, be lower than the $0.03 you're expecting in the fourth quarter? Ian M. Cook: We -- I will offer nothing on 2015, Connie. We really have not got that far at all. And all I can say about the pricing we have received is that the government provided specific direction as to the categories that we were permitted to take pricing in and indeed what the level would be by category and by size within that category. So I think, it would be perhaps na\u00efve to assume that, that would allow companies to take pricing as they wish. And I think, any future pricing would be, likewise, a similar discussion with the government. So I don't necessarily view it as a onetime, but I don't view it as opening the door to companies taking pricing at will. Operator : And next, we'll move on to Alice Longley with Buckingham Research. Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : I have a couple of follow-up questions on China. You said that demand is growing mid-single digits and I guess you expect your shipments to start growing at that amount -- at that rate starting now. Does that include online sales? And could you also tell us what percentage of your sales there now are online and give us some sense of how quickly that's shifting? And also, how much of that growth is price? And then, finally, I'm just wondering whether the shift to online could be 1 of the reasons that there was an inventory issue. Maybe there was too much inventory in 1 channel versus this other channel that's growing faster? Ian M. Cook: So to respond Alice thanks for the question, yes, the consumer offtake has returned to that mid-single digits level. And yes, our sales are now servicing that level of consumption. So we saw that in the last month of the quarter. And it would be fair to say that's what we expect going forward. Relative to online, I know in some categories in China, online is a large and fast growth segment or retail environment. But in our business, it's not so. We are represented, but the amount of business done online in our categories is de minimis and I don't think would have in any way, affected the trade destocking. And as we look forward to 2015 in terms of the balance between pricing and volume for a country, again, we haven't finished our budgeting process and I probably wouldn't say anyway. Operator : And we'll move on to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the advertising and commercial investment mix because Bina pointed out in the prepared remarks that the total basket of spending was still [indiscernible] and advertising was down. So what is your, I guess, plan for that over the next couple of quarters? Was this in somewhat reactionary to the more competitive environment in the U.S.? But is it really -- is that the same around the world? If there's a bit more in-store promotion going on versus advertising? What were some of the decisions made and how I guess not permanent but how sticky do you think they'll prove to be? Ian M. Cook: If I sort of take a 20,000 view around the world, 20,000-foot view around on the world, we have seen in many markets competitors reduce their advertising weight in market and shift spending to price promotion or coupon-driven promotion, perhaps in the quest for short-term volume. You have no choice at some level but to respond to that. So part of it is that. Part of it, as we have said for a long time and we must find a way of being more articulate about it, but part of it is structural in terms of the way you engage with consumers. With the techniques we have today, in-store engagement, the sharper marketing we talked about with consumers, which often comes out of trade spending, can be a very effective way of building trial for a product. So some of it is a conscious shift to techniques that we know work when you can target particular consumers in different retail environments. And as we think forward, our preferred view, as we have said before as well, is that we believe in driving growth, particularly when markets are growing less fast through innovation and innovation supported by advertising that generates trial, not price promotion. And therefore, our planning assumptions or our thinking going forward is that we would see that traditional below-the-line advertising come back. But we would not let ourselves become disadvantaged tactically as time unfolds. But our preferred model is innovation-led advertising, supported with quality execution on the ground that makes your product irresistible in store. By your product, I mean our product. Operator : And we'll move on to Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: Ian, a little bit of a follow-up to Lauren's question with regards to trader spending and couponing and all that. Do you think that -- are you getting -- now that you shifted more toward trader spending, are you getting the volume lift that you hope or not? And if you did, are you -- are we going to see more of flattish advertising versus trader spending? And related to that, also to what extent -- what are the issues you see that market share gains have slowed, either because Unilever is no longer losing as much share in toothpaste and Procter is more aggressive in some of the key markets like China and Brazil? Ian M. Cook: Yes, where to start. The -- I think, it's fair to say that the adjustments we made and I think we've talked at the beginning of the year about Mexico and the U.S., as Bina has commented, have been effective in rebuilding our market share. And that was something we believe we had to do in the face of the competitive activity. We don't see that as a permanent strategy and I would come back and say innovation-led, advertising-supported but irresistible in store is the way we would think about prioritizing our spending. In terms of the share discussion, you'd kind of have the go around the world. Suffice it to say, you mentioned China, I would say, in China, we have approaching a 34% market share in China, and both our principal multinational competitors are seeing share decline. And so from an aggression point of view, honestly, we aren't seeing it. And we're not -- we're certainly not seeing it in the market share. So it's a market-by-market thing. And in Mexico and the U.S., it was an adjustment we made. But if you take the world, our preferred approach is innovation, advertising-supported, irresistible in store. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I wanted to talk about your expectation for 4% to 7% sales growth for 2015 in the context of lapping China and Brazil destocking, and now the commentary about pricing coming in Venezuela. So it would seem a bit like growth should be better next year relative to this year. So I guess that they're both sort of the same but how much of that is conservatism, how much of it is an assumption about category growth somewhere going up, going down. Maybe just any other color you could give sort on the underlying expectations for next year would be helpful. Ian M. Cook: Yes, 4% to 7%, Mark, allows it to get better. But I think, just based on everything you see in the world today, it seemed prudent to widen that range a little because who knows what next year brings. I think, when we speak again after our fourth quarter and we would have been through our budgeting process, we will be in a far better position to perhaps give a sharper guidance at that time. So I think, this brings the call to a close. I thank you all for joining us. Thank you very much for the interest in the company and the questions you always have. And thank you, again, to all those Colgate people who may be listening. We value the work you do. Goodbye. Operator : And that does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.",

Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Bina Thompson. Please go ahead, Bina. Bina H. Thompson: Thanks, Kathy, and good morning everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings release conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. We\u2019re pleased to exit 2014 with organic sales up 6% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, which was the strongest quarter of last year. Our market shares were strong around the world as you will hear in a moment. As always, innovation has been critical to our success we\u2019re excited about our pipeline looking forward to 2015 and beyond. In many markets, macroeconomic challenges persist and of course, foreign exchange has been and will continue to be a considerable headwind as translation alone is projected to impact EPS in 2015 over 10% at current foreign exchange rate. That makes us even more pleased to be able to deliver continued organic sales growth and positive results on the bottom line. While our gross margin was down in the quarter due to very significant transaction costs, we believe that we will see an improving trend as we move through 2015 with a more benign raw material cost environment and pricing taken to offset the impact of rising transaction costs related to foreign exchange. Our funding-the-growth program is as robust as ever in our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track. Generated in 2014, related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, we are over a $100 million after-tax and above the top end of our projected range. Overhead expenses are down in the quarter due to tight controls in all divisions and savings from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Our total commercial spending also increased into both existing and new products. We think we are well poised to meet the challenges we face as we enter 2015. We believe our strong balance sheet and solid cash generation should keep us in good stead. So turning to North America, we are very pleased with our progress here innovation is contributing to organic sales growth and we have more plan for this year. In the fourth quarter, in the U.S., our market share increased year-to-date in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes and was even with the prior year in mouthwash. Results are strong across our portfolio in toothpaste. Our Colgate Total toothpaste share remains over 10% supported by a graphic refresh, relaunch of Colgate total events whitening and the boost provided by our companion Colgate Total Lasting White mouthwash. The Colgate Optic White franchise is also doing well as the superpremium is driving instrumentality with its year-to-date toothpaste share up from 5.3% to 5.6%. And as you know, we also launched Colgate Enamel Health toothpaste and toothbrushes in the second half of 2014. It's off to a strong start and our overall toothpaste share is up 1.4% in the three months after its launch as compared to the three months prior. In the mouthwash category, our year-to-date share is up more than 4 points, while our two major competitors full-year shares declined with excellent result from Colgate Total Lasting White mouthwash. Our fabric conditioner business continues to perform well both for the full-year and the quarter, our market share is up over 4 points to a new record, close to 20% of the overall market and as you know, these products are primarily sold in Hispanic markets. Now, as you would expect, we have more innovation slated for 2015 with a full grid plan for the first quarter. In toothpaste, we are launching Colgate Optic White Expressway toothpaste. This innovation provides whiter teeth in just three days simply by brushing with best results after four weeks of brushing as directed is Colgate\u2019s fastest whitening toothpaste and it\u2019s enamel-safe for daily use. In the mouthwash category we\u2019re launching Colgate Total gum health mouthwash it provides advanced gum protection for 45% stronger healthier gums versus the non-antibacterial mouthwash. Fights plaque between teeth and along the gum line and kills 99% of germs on contact with 12 hour protection against bacteria that caused gingivitis. In the toothbrush category, we are launching Colgate Sensitive toothbrush plus sensitivity relief pen. Using the same innovative pen application technology is so successful in the whitening segment. This pen utilizes our patented Pro Argin technology to deliver sensitivity relief 24/7 with continued use and goes right to the source of the pain. To rekindle momentum in the dish liquid category we\u2019re launching premium priced Palmolive Multi-Surface, which is specially formulated to kill bacteria on dishes and hardened non-core kitchen surfaces. And on the value side we\u2019re launching Ajax all-in-one dish liquid which has a new formula with 10% more cleaning ingredients than before. And to further our success in the fabric conditioner category we\u2019re launching Suavitel fragrance pro with the proprietary scent system which provides five times longer lasting fragrance compared with using detergent alone. As well as Suavitel fast dryer sheets which helps close dry 30% faster than using detergent alone. Turning then to Europe South Pacific, we enjoyed another quarter of organic sales growth in this region with a slight acceleration in volumes in the third quarter. Our commercial hubbing activities part of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program are now complete and were implemented with very little disruption in fact in the quarter we're virtually all new hubs delivered positive organic sales growth. Innovation is critical in this part of the world and it continues to contribute to market share growth in a number of categories. Our market shares across Europe are up year-to- date in toothpaste, manual toothbrush, battery toothbrush, mouthwash, liquid hand soap and dish liquids. Of note all categories of our Sanex business has grown market share year-to-date, shower gel, liquid hand soap and underarm protection. Our launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus sugar acid neutralizer is now complete across the region with excellent share results in a number of markets. One of our first launch market Denmark posted a 4.1 share in the most recent period and two larger more recent launch markets, the UK and France have already achieved 1.5% and 2% shares respectively in the most recent periods. Building on this success in 2015 we will continue full marketing support for the toothpaste along with a further rollout of a companion toothbrush and mouthwash. As I just mentioned, our Sanex business is performing well and recent exciting new product activity to support further growth. Launching in the first quarter is Sanex advance, Sanex's first body care regimen developed with a leading dermatologist. Available in three different formulations, the regimen will include a body lotion and hand cream, to complement the body wash and deodorant. This is Sanex's first entry into the hands and body lotion category. The Sanex Advance Dermo Repair bundle for dry skin with minor damage contains active restore complex and [allantoin] to restore pH balance and miniaturization. The Sanex Advance Atopiderm bundles for extra dry atopic skin contains skin identical lipids and emollients to help restore the skins protective barrier, sooth itchiness and control hypersensitivity, helping the skin to keep functioning normally. The Sanex Advanced Hydrate 24h bundle for very dried dehydrated skin uses Ceragly Activ technology in a shower gel and lotion which has a pseudo-ceramides and glycerin to maintain the skins\u2019 protective barriers by locking in the moisture. And in addition, will be launching Sanex in Poland, a new geography which will provide incremental new business for us. Turning then to Latin America, business across this region is solid, organic sales growth accelerated from the prior two quarters in 2014 and while volume increased a modest 1% versus the year-ago period, this was on top of a very strong increase of 10% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Toothpaste shares are strong across the region, in Mexico our most recent share is 80.8% up 80 basis points in the year ago period. Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection has achieved a 2% share in the most recent period. In Brazil in December our toothpaste share reached 72.1% for the month, the highest share in the past 18-years. This is in spite of a lot of competitive activity. Our manual toothpaste business is performing well. In Mexico, we achieved a record share of 45% in the latest leading, while for the first time our major competitor dropped below 40% share. Soap was across all retail environment, self-service stores, pharmacies and the indirect trade. We reached a record year-to-date share in Brazil as well with good growth in the superpremium segment with a 32.4% share of the market the number one position. In bar soaps we\u2019ve strengthened our leadership position across the region of half a point on a year-to-date basis to 29.7% with the most recent lead at 29.9%. Innovation in both the Palmolive and Protex equities has contributed this success. And in the Home Care category our year-to-date regional market shares have increased in fabric conditioners of 50 basis points to 51.6% and in liquid cleaners of 70 basis points to 36.3% and we have more exciting new products plan for 2015 across all our categories. In the first quarter, specifically where excited about a new subcategory in the Protex Body Cleansing category, feminine intimate wash. Protex is a brand that's recognized as an expert in skin protection and is positioned to transfer readily into the intimate soap subcategory. It will be launched with a fully integrated marketing campaign including our products website and endorsements from a well-known journalist. Primary placement in-store will be on the intimate shelf with secondary placement on the soap shop to attract attention from loyal Protex users. Turning then to Asia, we\u2019re pleased with the acceleration of organic sales growth in this region as we indicated would happen last quarter. And as referenced in the press release we saw good toothpaste market share gains in a number of countries. In India, our market shares increased to 54.4% up 30 basis points on a year-to-date basis. Colgate Active Salt toothpaste developed especially for this market where salt promotes antibacterial efficacy increased 70 basis points to over a 5% share. In Malaysia, our year-to-date share is up 30 basis points to just over 73%. Anticavity segment now comprises almost 27% of the market and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste launched last February has a 3.2% share year-to-date with the most recent lead of 4%. In manual toothbrushes, our regional share increased 20 basis points year-to-date to 30.2% with eight out of 10 countries reporting stable positive growth. In India, our share reached a record 43.2% up 120 basis points on a year-to-date basis. Innovation under the Colgate Slim Soft equity has been particularly successful. And our regional mouthwash share increased 120 basis points year-to-date to 23.1% with the most recent period at 24.6%. Looking forward in toothpaste, we will be relaunching both our base sensitivity line as well as the Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief line. In addition, we will be adding Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent. This new product has a unique calcium and amino acid complex which repairs the root cause of sensitivity preventing the pain from returning. In India, we will be launching Colgate Active Salt with neem. The neem tree in India is known for its antibacterial properties. In certain markets we will also introduce a line of Kids toothpaste for children aged two to five, a segment currently somewhat underdeveloped which presents a great incremental opportunity. New in the mouthwash category will be Colgate Plax Bamboo Charcoal and as you know Charcoal is also why reviewed as an ingredient to fight bacteria. Turning then to Africa/Eurasia, this region continues to deliver strong organic sales growth despite some macroeconomic challenges in the countries such as Russia. Our regional toothpaste share is up 10 basis points to 32.4% year-to-date. And despite difficulties in Russia and the Ukraine our year-to-date share is up 10 basis points to 32.9% in Russia and up 170 basis points in the Ukraine to 28.2%. We have also seen good share increases across Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa. In manual toothbrushes, Colgate 360 and Colgate Slim Soft have helped increase our share in Turkey, up 30 basis points year-to-date to 28.7%. In South Africa, we are up 380 basis points year-to-date to over 38% of the market. And across the region our mouthwash share is up 30 basis points year-to-date approaching 20%. Colgate is the number two mouthwash brand in Africa/Eurasia. You may recall, we told you about a new product in Russia Colgate Altai Herbs mouthwash. That has contributed to 210 basis point increase in our Russian mouthwash share to 27.5% year-to-date. We also have a good market leading shower gel business in this region. Our year-to-date share is up 120 basis points to almost 22%. Russia, Turkey and South Africa have all reached record shares. We told you on previous calls about our Palmolive Gourmet Spa line with enticing coffee, chocolate, vanilla and peach fragrances. That innovation has been one of the drivers of the excellent share performance. And innovation this quarter continues. To support our relaunch of our Colgate Total toothpaste portfolio, we have initiated a new integrated marketing campaign around the idea of the incredible mouth. The idea is that Colgate knows that your mouth is incredibly weak, which is why Colgate developed Colgate Total to protect 100% of your mouth not only your teeth. To continue the momentum in our shower gel business, we are launching Palmolive Tiger freshness for men. You may recall we\u2019ve had great success with Colgate Altai Herbs products toothpaste, mouthwash and body cleansing. Outside is a region in Russia known for its herbs which are believed to have curative properties. Similarly Tiger is the northern forest characterized by pine bruises and larches covering much of Northern Eurasia. This new product offers a freshness and cleanliness of the legendary [tiger] in your shower. Finally, we are pleased with Hill's continued good organic sales growth of 4% in the quarter particularly when compared to a strong 7% growth in the year ago quarter. Innovation has driven good results across our Science Diet, Prescription Diet and Ideal Balance portfolios. For the Science Diet portfolio, nutritional consultant shopper engagement at superstores and sampling of our new salt savory treat here in the U.S. has helps drive sales. In Europe, Hill Science Plan Perfect Weight has been supported with secondary displays in-store and in-store weighing area and on shelf dynamic cleans to explain the product benefits. Here in the U.S. Hill\u2019s Ideal Balance has gained share in both the wellness and natural segments and consumption of the product in superstores was up strongly versus the year ago period. In Europe, the product contained excellent trade acceptance in the UK and Germany two large pet food markets and receive support with promotional activities and secondary placement. And our prescription diet metabolic line continues to meet with success. To build on that, this quarter we're launching prescription diet metabolic plus. 32 million pets have obesity related concurrent conditions. This is the first and only dual efficacy therapeutic pet nutrition food. It will be available for weight loss plus mobility for dogs, and weight loss plus Urinary Stress for cats. The product will be available in both a dry and stew format. And we\u2019re also very excited about the new global packaging redesign across the prescription range. With more consumer friendly packaging and new better tasting formulas, the bundle is designed to create a stronger emotional connection to strengthen our leadership and innovation credentials and improved taste reception that's rolling out across the US, Canada and some of the high-growth markets in the first quarter of 2015 and Europe in the second quarter. So in summary, we believe our solid results for the quarter are a good indication that we have effective strategy. And we believe that this consistent strategy has stood as well for many years. We know it well. Staying close to the customer and consumer, innovating everywhere becoming more effective and efficient and on going leadership development. We believe our objectives on the ground have the tools to make the right decisions balancing price and volume supporting innovation in-store and out increasing market share all this is winning on the ground. We in our competition are like are faced with choppy times, volatile swings in currency and macroeconomic challenges in many parts of the world. So we believe it\u2019s a simple consistent focus well understood by every Colgate person that makes the difference. And now I'd like to turn it over to Q&A. Kathy. Operator : Thank you. Today\u2019s question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically for the telephone audiences. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll first go to Steve Powers from UBS. Stephen Powers : Hi, Bina. Ian good morning. Ian M. Cook: Good morning, Steve. Stephen Powers : Maybe just a few little things to kick things off of we could first could you just start up by providing the gross margin bridge for Q4 and maybe talk a little bit about how those drivers are expected to trend into 2015, any changes in margin improvement or organic growth expectations for the year versus last quarters outlook would be great. And then maybe drilling in could you also provide a little update on volume and sales trends in China and Brazil specifically, it looks like things improvement is expected in China, but you were still battling through some inventory issues in Brazil. I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s a fair read and just the expectations on how you expect momentum to trend from here. Thanks. Ian M. Cook: We\u2019ll see, I think as Bina said at the end of her prepared remarks, I guess we live in a world these days where focus is really important, but so is agility and I think you saw in the fourth quarter the agility and the balance I guess between volume and price as our 6% was composed of volume growth in all divisions in pricing increases largely in the developing world. So if we take that to the gross profit row forward and you go back to the prior year gross profit 59.1, we benefited from 1.4 points of pricing, as you can see a step-up from the prior three quarters between our funding the growth and restructuring, we had something like 280 basis points of benefit and then faced a headwind in terms of material prices of some 4.3 point of which two points for the quarter was transaction and then they were 20 basis points negative of some other minor changes which gets you to the 58.8% gross margin. Interestingly, although we are where we are if you were to go back to the October conversation we had and our expectation for the full quarter of gross margin to be even with prior year, if you just stripped out the exchange deterioration since our October call, in fact for this quarter our gross margin would have been at prior year level. What we manage to do by moving quickly on pricing was to offset the dollar impact of the foreign exchange but not yet the ratio impact. So that\u2019s 2014, when you go forward into 2015, I guess you have got a few things in terms of our view on gross margin, our view on gross margin for 2015 is that we will expand it between 50 and 100 basis points on the year. Now that is going to progress through the year from the first to the fourth quarter. We get a benefit in 2015 of course, from the current oil prices which we expect to work through towards the end of the first half next year and of course commodity materials which our forecast would say more or less flat year-on-year and these are benefits we haven\u2019t seen in prior year. We will continue and indeed already have take pricing particularly in those emerging markets where we have to meet the transaction impact of foreign exchange, because that\u2019s what translate into the operating earnings. We will of course be focus on our funding the growth program which again should benefit in 2015 from a more benign cost environment and of course we have our restructuring program. So, as we begin 2015, we feel good with the expansion target of plus 50 to 100 basis points on gross margin stepping it way up through the year. Now when you come back to the topline of the company, I think the fourth quarter played out organically pretty much the way we expected it. We see the destocking in China behind us and that\u2019s why we see that the 6% organic there and indeed organic growth in the country itself. In terms of Brazil we said that we would still be working through the destocking in the fourth quarter that would be completed in the fourth quarter and then we would move into 2015 and indeed that has been the case. But if you step back and kind of take a look at where is the consumer we continue to see for our categories that in North America category growth, and again I am talking our categories, is between 1% and 2% as we said on the last call it is edging widely up to the upper end of that 1% to 2% range. Europe continues to be more even between 0% and 1% and across the emerging markets we continue to feel comfortable with the mid single-digit local currency value growth rates for our categories. So that\u2019s the environment we see in 2015 with China and Brazil now behind us. Operator : And we will move on to our next question from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian: Hey, good morning. Ian M. Cook: Hi, Dara. Dara W. Mohsenian: Ian, pricing accelerated pretty significantly sequentially in Q4 and was a big driver of the organic sales growth acceleration in both emerging markets and globally, so I just wanted to get an update on your view of the competitive environment here, and your ability to sustain that level of pricing going forward with a lower oil costs and flat commodities overall. Or even get more pricing with some of the incremental FX pressures you are seeing. And then also in Q4 on a related note, how much of the Latin America price increase was related to Venezuela and Argentina? Thanks. Ian M. Cook: Yes, I think we have demonstrated fairly consistently and ability to deliver pricing to offset the transaction impact of foreign exchange. I think we demonstrated that in the fourth quarter and we expect to continue to price as we have already done in some parts of the world. So pricing will be a factor in growth and in our gross margin expansion plans for 2015 and we believe as we indeed already have, that we will be able to realize that, and I go back to the fourth quarter and say there was a fairly meaningful step up in pricing in those emerging markets and yet we still had a balance between volume growth and pricing growth. Now, when you turn to Latin America, the need for pricing again is driven by foreign exchange and if you look at Latin America, overall, we took pricing in the fourth quarter and you see pricing up literally across the geography, from Mexico through Central America, our Indian group, Venezuela, Brazil, and the Southern, so we took pricing across the board in Venezuela as we told you on the last call, we, along with our two principal multinational competitors and the large local player down there, on price controlled categories, got approval to increase pricing and so we, along with everyone else, increased pricing in Venezuela and that will roll forward into 2015. But again, you look at Asia, you look at Africa, Eurasia, we're taking pricing in all parts of the world that are affected by foreign exchange. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move to Chris Ferrara of Wells Fargo. Christopher Ferrara : Good morning. Ian M. Cook: Hi, Chris. Christopher Ferrara : Ian, just a follow-up on that, look I can appreciate that you don\u2019t want to breakout exactly what Venezuela pricing is but I think the question on lot of people\u2019s mind is just look the Latam segment pricing and the resilience of volume even our tough comp was very impressive that was very impressive. But I think what we\u2019re all trying to figure out is as it relates to the sustainability of it was Venezuela and Argentina a disproportionate driver of that right in other words can we feel comfortable with the assumption that you guys were able to hold volume very well across the segment broadly and the numbers aren\u2019t necessarily skewed by Venezuela and Argentina. Ian M. Cook: Clearly, we got more pricing in Venezuela, because we had no pricing for an extended period of years. So the answer there is clearly yes as it was for everybody else that we compete with in that country. I think the more pertinent question is our ability to maintain that pricing and continue to increase that pricing going forward and our view is that, yes, we can. And again, I come back to the fourth quarter, having taken pricing we did see volume growth in all of our divisions. Now of course, that step in Venezuelan pricing will ease off as we work our way through 2015, because Venezuela is much more episodic than many of the other markets. So the answer is yes. And again, back to the consumer behavior, we continue to see our categories hold in the emerging markets at mid-single digits. And remember, as you will see when we file our K for us 2014, Venezuela continues to represent about 3% of the company\u2019s worldwide sales and only about 1% of the operating margin. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : Good morning, thanks. I wanted to ask you about consumer consumptions levels, do you think that the current gross rates that you are posting are inline with where consumer consumption is right now. And on top of that how do you think about your inventory levels at retail. And then I also want to touch a little bit on the elasticity of demand in your categories because in the past you said that consumers understand pricing due to FX but at what point does that equation start to potentially breakdown because this quarter you obviously saw a big acceleration in price and volume really didn\u2019t accelerate all that much, but can you help us understand the analytics, just make sure you don\u2019t potentially go over board on pricing and what you consider too much, like if volume decelerates to the point where you are seeing negatives which you consider that to go too far and clearly I\u2019m painting specially about Latin America. Thanks so much. Ian M. Cook: Yes. Well clearly Olivia, as I\u2019m sure all other companies do, we do considerable work to balance even the short-term volume impact at the pricing we take. I come back and say we sold volume growth in all of our emerging markets even with the stepped up pricing we took in the fourth quarter, so we think we have a handle on it and we think again, remember the types of products we are selling that we can take the pricing necessary to offset the foreign exchange impacts and continue to maintain that balance between volume and price and indeed volume slows a little bit when you take the pricing, but then that balance comes back. Look, on retail inventory you may remember, we were the first to talk about the destocking in China and I think we\u2019ve tried to be very transparent about what we saw unfolding in the marketplace is the China destocking is behind us and I said on the last call that we expected brazil to work through in the fourth quarter and it has done. We track not only retail inventory, we track inventories with all of our distributors country-by-country and we have parameters that actually relate back to the return on invested capital the distributor gets in terms of the inventory levels that they would hold. So we have a very clear view on that inventory and we have a very sharp focus on making sure that it is not at least by our actions out of balance. What we saw in Brazil and China was a marketplace destocking because of the slowdown in the category. So I think you can feel confident that we have very much control on that inventory. And remember as we talked about when we went through those sub-prime years in difficult times, products in our categories if you will become the simple luxuries that consumers can afford. So the behavior of using these products does not go away when times get slightly tougher. Operator : And next we have John A. Faucher from JPMorgan. Ian M. Cook: Hey John. John A. Faucher: Hey Ian, how are you? Ian M. Cook: We\u2019re good. Thanks. John A. Faucher: Excellent, so just wanted to follow up and some of the guidance commentary in terms of I think you said that or Bina said rather that the 10% is the translation number. So can you talk a little bit about that the transaction pieces little bit different now given what we\u2019ve seen in terms of the move in the euro and some of the other more developed market currencies, which obviously are negative? So can you talk about sort of how much of the transaction piece maybe you are not going to cover and can you get pricing in developed markets to cover some of this transactional pieces. Is that a possibility, even or that something where you basically say you know what we are going have to yet that impact given where the market is right now? Thanks. Ian M. Cook: Yes, thanks John. Let me just complete what Bina said I mean so when you think about foreign exchange as a headwind, yes, the translation impact is 10% on the bottom line. On the topline we see it going to be about 7% and 7.5% on the year. So that just gives you the breath of that. In terms of the transaction impacts, that is embedded into our guidances on gross margin being up 50 to 100 basis points. The transaction impact whether it\u2019s the balance sheet aspect of payable in the short-term or the more substantive foreign exchange impact on raw materials imported finished goods. In the medium term that hits the gross margin squarely and if you don\u2019t recover that you can\u2019t deliver an operating return, so all of our guidance is assuming our ability to offset that transaction impact. Now remember, offsetting that transaction impact is not just a function of list price increases in any given marketplace. It could be benefited from mix, it could be benefited from different types of promotional activity, but elevate the ASP we have the benefit of our funding the growth program we have the benefit of the global growth and restructuring program that we have underway. And as I said, at the beginning the benefit of a more benign commodity environment especially in the area. Now if you look at Europe and North America list price increases are difficult to accomplish, but you saw in Europe terrific margin expansion this year. So there its going to be some of the other techniques, but I think are going to continue to drive gross margin. Most especially funding the growth efforts, the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and what we can do with our promotional efficiencies as we go forward rather than list price increases, but that's the way we plan the year, John. Operator : And next we have Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joseph Altobello : Thank you, good morning. Ian M. Cook: Good morning, Joe. Joseph Altobello : Just want to shift gears a bit to SG&A I want to put the 50 basis points of overhead savings in some context. It seems like it\u2019s a bit of an out layer compared to the last few quarters. First of all what was the FX impact on SG&A in the quarter and how sustainable is the 50 basis points you saw on the fourth quarter and how should we think about advertising next year came down about 60 basis points in 2014 it was down both absolutely as a percentage of sales. So I am curious how are you thinking about that as you are shifting dollars and advertising to promotion in 2015? Thanks. Ian M. Cook: Well, let me start with the advertising, Joe. So as we have said for quite a considerable time, the advertising is a combination of what we all grew up with which is the traditional media and promotion and we have always balanced that in terms of the traditional with the in-store activity that we undertake during the year. So if you look at the balance, in fact, in the quarter, our total commercial investment was up as it was for the year. Interestingly many of our competitors in many large markets around the world eased back on their traditional advertising spend. So in many of those markets actually our competitive pressure was actually strengthened. Now as we think about 2015 in terms of that traditional bucket of advertising and promotion, we are planning for that to increase absolutely and as a percentage to sale. And as we have always done we will continue to balance that as the year unfolds. So we feel very much that the advertising is where we needed to be. And I think candidly Joe, when you look at the results in the fourth quarter, we got a 6% organic growth rate and delivered a pretty robust bottom line. And of course is that kind of sustainable top and bottom line growth that we are focused on, relative to the overhead Forex is that much of an impact. We continue to expect to make progress in terms of overheads, because the global growth and efficiency program is largely focused in that area rather than gross margin this time around. And again, as Bina said, we were ahead of delivery of that program in 2014 and we will continue to make progress in 2015. Operator : We will now move on to William Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz : Hi, good morning, Ian. Ian M. Cook: Hey, Bill. William Schmitz : Hey, so I am just trying to figure out the organic top line guide I mean you gave market growth rates, is that going to be your growth as well. Because like if I wait sort of 45% developed, 55% emerging assume that, develop pieces 1% to 2% and the emerging is 5% to 6%. I kind of get you like 3% to 5% range, is that the right way to think about that or do you think you\u2019re going to continue to gain market share in the growth asset in the markets. Ian M. Cook: We\u2019ve been quite pleased with our market share progress Joe and caller says Joe, Dale everyone is Joe and obviously we had some new businesses that we're entering whether it\u2019s the intimate product, whether its new markets with Sanex and indeed some of the new geographies we have around the world like Nigeria, like Iran, like stepping up our position in Bangladesh, but we continue to be comfortable with that 4% to 7% range that we have talked about which we think adequately reflects the volatility that is in our world. You know if you take 2013 as a year a full-year, we came in about 6% if you look at 2014 now as a full-year we came in organic growth about 5%, so we think that 4% to 7% range remains reasonable and indeed that is what we are planning against. And I\u2019m sorry about the name slip up. Operator : And next we have Michael Steib of Credit Suisse. Michael Steib : Good morning Ian. Ian M. Cook: Good morning Joe. Michael Steib : My question relates to the U.S. environment really, you said that you have category growth is edging towards the upper end of the 1% to 2% range, yet pricing in your categories continues to be down due to the promotional activities. Given the commodity cost tailwind, even if its marginal that you are going to experience next year, do you see that promotional environment remain at broadly similar levels going forward, or should it get - intensify from here? Ian M. Cook: Well I think Michael that our assumptions is that it will continue pretty much as it has been, when you look at 2014 you might say that some of the \u2013 shall we say naked pricing pressure has come off, but we definitely saw in the North American environment couponing both in terms of the number of coupons dropped, and you know that\u2019s a large part of U.S. promotional activity and works its way through the income statement and price that couponing volume and couponing values both stepped up substantially in 2014 and we expect that will continue in 2015. Now in part coupons create trial for new products, so that\u2019s quite healthy, so you will see some bumps I guess quarter-by-quarter because of that. So we are assuming that competitive environment in our categories at least will continue as we\u2019ve seen it per haps with more emphasis towards cuoponing. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move to Connie Maneaty of BMO Capital. Constance Marie Maneaty.: Good morning. I was hoping that you would discuss some metrics that have improved in the areas where you have completed the move to your new hubbings? Ian M. Cook: Okay, I think we \u2013 the new areas really will back up, I mean we have had hubbing operations in parts of our world for a long period of time and I think we talked about that relative to Latin America when I talked about the groups we had there in the activity we took that, the next big tranche if you will hubbing has been Europe and in that environment we have both accomplished and delivered the savings and the efficiency that we were looking for and now the market level activity begins and the next like of that journey. Now will be to get the accrued benefits of having hubs now with shared service centers and I guess frankly most importantly of all with that focus and the ability to sharpen our investments behind the businesses as you saw in release and in being is commentary market shares in our principal categories are up. And that in a slow growth European environment is ultimately what all depends I think our ability to continue to deliver organic growth in that part of the world, which when you think about why we prioritizes Europe first from the global growth and efficiency point of view was the objective of the exercise. Operator : And next we have Bill Chapel with SunTrust. William Chapel : Good morning, thank you. Ian M. Cook: Hi, Bill, good morning. William Chapel : In [indiscernible] walk through as we look at oil kind of dropping to where it did in the fourth quarter, how that works through your P&L over the next 12 months, I mean in terms of big diesel or just straight oil or resin, I mean and maybe percentages if you can \u2013 we see 50% of the benefit by the first half or do we really not see it until the second half. Just trying to get gauge of how it really influences the business and how long it takes to influence the business? Ian M. Cook: Yes, well you know as you\u2019ve heard for many there is a lead lag things in life have a way of going up quicker than they come down. If you take oil the most immediate benefit you get tends to be in freight because that price is quite quickly and so we got a little bit of benefit in the fourth quarter very modest and we expect that to benefit of starting in this quarter in 2015. When you talk about the flow through benefits of the resin impact and the other material impact that will start to benefit us towards the end of the first half partly related to it working through the system, partly related to our own inventory levels, you have to work those through before you get the benefit which is why we make the point that as we build to that 50 to 100 basis points gross margin improvement, it is going to build across the year, because the commodity benefits will really start flowing in the second quarter. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Phil Astrachan from Stifel. Ian M. Cook: Hi, Mark. Mark S. Astrachan: Hi, how are you doing everybody, good morning. I wanted to just ask follow-up to that last question, just where are you budgeting oil for 2015 and then just you\u2019re shifting gears, could you talk a bit about your thoughts on share gains that you've seen from some of your euro-based competitors over the last three to five years. And your views on sending off some sort of incremental spend that they're going to have given current exchange rates as well as potentially reversing some of those share gains that you had or sort of just broadly have you think about a more able-bodied competitive landscape from some of those companies? Ian M. Cook: Yes, we - in terms of the oil we actually budgeted oil at about $60, so obviously if it says that the current level we will pick up a little bit more, we\u2019ll have to see how all of that works through across the year. In terms of European-based competitors, if you mean from a foreign exchange point of view, we're all managing in a world. And we all have different parts of the world and we all have growth ambitions in those different parts of the world. We have, we think being quite responsible with the benefit of Global Growth and Efficiency Program in Europe and making sure that our commercial investments, including traditional advertising and promotion, are appropriate for both the European category growth rates and the competitors we meet in Europe. If we see things change, and we think we need to be more responsive back to this notion of agility and balance. We will take the appropriate action. But right now we are quite comfortable with our European growth. And with our investments stands there relative to both the categories and our competitors. Operator : And next we will go to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ian M. Cook: Hey, Ali. Ali Dibadj : Hi, guys how are you? So just a couple of quick follow-ups and one is and I'm sorry you might have said this but I jumped off for a second if you could quantify actually Ian the Venezuela impact on your growth rate because even that\u2019s you know 3% of sales that we said price mix as best as we can tell you put that together it might be 0.50, two points of your six point growth. So if you have [indiscernible] if you could say that again and I do want to go back to this ad spend begin down 8% below 10% for you which is something into 2009. And its point I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unique to you guys. Lot of the companies in the sector are kind of that your point balance the above the line versus the below line ad spend. And the list of the brand, so I am trying to get a sense from you because I [indiscernible] one quarter, right so. So the list of the brand as you go forward and how do you think about that gross to net versus pure ad spend and what the right balance is? Ian M. Cook: Yes, well know even if you did drop off Ali, we didn\u2019t provide that information on Venezuela and we won\u2019t now, that the point I did make relative to Venezuela in the Latin America, is that we took pricing across Latin America in the fourth quarter, in the case of Venezuela, yes, it was episodic as we said in the third quarter it would be, because haven\u2019t had pricing for several years that same episodic benefit also benefited our principal multi national competitors who got the same government approvals on key categories for them at exactly the same time we got out and indeed the local competitors was granted pricing as well. So everybody benefited from pricing in Venezuela. But the point to make is we took pricing across the board and then environment, where everybody was getting pricing our global growth rate was indeed 6%. In terms of the advertising yes you are right, one has to be conscious about the brand health as we call it. I will say that the kind of model that perhaps the many of us grew up with where what was accounted foreign trade spending was inherently bad and only the so called below the line spending was good. I think those days are gone, I think ones ability take Hispanic consumers in the U.S. that you can reach with in-store activity that may have a component of price, but might be much more driven by a coupon that has regionally dropped at high population areas. These kind of techniques are now available and they weren\u2019t available before and you can measure them, you can execute them, retailers can handle different configurations to put them at work with a consumer, but coming back to the brands, we do, do tracking work and our tracking work around the world shows that if you take our Oral Care business around the world, the health is very, very good of those brands. So by all means we track it, sometimes from a short-term point of view if couponing or other activity steps up, you have no option at least in part to participate, but I think we\u2019ve been one of the loudest voices at least I hope so in saying that we much prefer to compete in an environment of innovation with marketing support than price promotion, but we don\u2019t see a weakness in brand health that is something of course we have and we will continue to track. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren R. Lieberman: Thanks, good morning. Ian M. Cook: Good morning Lauren. Lauren R. Lieberman: Just two things. One was to follow-up on this conversation about in-store spend versus traditional advertising. Is it fair then to summarize kind of the environment you are seeing right now to say that in the regions where you have had more in-store spend, more promotion, its not necessarily because of negative flair ups in the competitive environment, it\u2019s a little bit more choiceful on how to best reach the consumer for a given activity that you guys have slated or is there in fact a kind of step up in the negative promotional environment currently? Ian M. Cook: I would say it is more the formal Lauren, and these are techniques that with our Colgate business planning and so on that we have learned to be efficient with, so its choiceful, but you know I also have to say take in environment like the United States, there is no question that that couponing environment has become more competitive and we have correspondingly become more competitive in that environment, but if I took an overall stance, I would say as we have been saying for a time that it is choiceful with techniques that we think not only reach the consumer, but actually strengthen the equity of our brands overtime. Operator : And now we will move on to Javier Escalante from Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante : Hi, good morning everyone. Ian M. Cook: Good morning Javier. Javier Escalante : My question has to do with detachment of a restructuring program. There was expanded to the saving target to up to $390 million, assumes to me that only a third of the savings has been accrued up to now. So I would like to understand how much of savings will accelerated in the next couple of years in order to hit the $390 million target and if you could help us understand what kind of activities are going to happen is this more hubbing like the one that you did in Europe or is it manufacturing facilities being up and up and in Asia help us understand physically what activities are going to take place that are going to help the savings to ramp up in the next - these two years? Okay thank you. Ian M. Cook: Yes, well, the first thing to say Javier the program is very much on track indeed has Bina said our performance in 2014 was up. If you look at our so far savings against the total we are running about half accrued. So its not a third and if you look at the activity going forward yes it is in the same areas that we had very much spoken to in the beginning. So it is the hubbing, it is what we are doing with our facilities and it is the expanded use of the Colgate business service centers and we are very excited by it, because we think as we have now seen in Europe not only does it bring you the immediate term savings, but it makes you operate smarter and faster and in a more efficient manner. So we like it, not just as a Global Growth and Efficiency Program, but because we think it ultimately gets this organizationally to a better place from an operating point of view. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Caroline Levy of CLSA. Ian M. Cook: Hi, Caroline. Caroline S. Levy: Good morning Ian and Bina, thanks. I\u2019ve got a question about Russia and another on Mexico. On Russia, I guess if you have to describe it as pretty chaotic and I'm just wondering how much of your pricing you were able to take in the fourth quarter and how much you think you still need to take and whether you think demand will drop off quite meaningfully. And secondly on Mexico, both Kimberly and Procter have had very difficult years trading in Mexico and they to some extent blamed the higher consumer tax. Are you seeing any slowdown in demand or did you see any slowdown, do you see any pick up what\u2019s going on in Mexico for you guys? Ian M. Cook: The Mexico hasn't changed for us. We certainly didn't see a 20% decline there nor did we see a 20% decline in China. So no that environment hasn\u2019t really changed for us. Russia for us is still a relatively modest part of our business between 1% and 2%.. Chaotic may be overstating it that it is indeed difficult. And it is likely to become more difficult. We have lived this before at the end of the 80s. And indeed the senior executive that lived within is living it again now. And so that we know the actions to take from a structural cost point of view and we are taking those actions and of course we are taking pricing, and we are transferring funds and we are watching closely distributions and wholesalers. So, we are very much managing Russia from a containment point view. But we\u2019re close to our businesses. So we believe we have a good handle. And interestingly shares were up. So maybe cold but there up. Operator : And we will take our final question from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English : All right, thank you guys for squeezing me in. Ian M. Cook: Hi, Jason. Jason English : Even got the name right. Ian M. Cook: Yes. Jason English : I\u2019ve got a couple of follow-up questions. Ian M. Cook: Good question, Joe. Jason English : There we go, there we go. All right, now it seems right. One on the promotional dynamics on P&G conference call they referenced expectation of 400 basis points of margin gains constant currency or even currency loaded out of Brazil and India. Hard to see how they get that without pulling some of the money to put in the market back out so are seeing the promotional intensity ease in those markets. And then secondly gross margins I just want to walk through a little more on, more deeply on the answer to the question earlier, your signaling sort of neutral commodities maybe even a little bit of favorability with oil so does study hold line on price, continued productivity, you do the math on that even if you assume that transactional headwinds become more substantial than they were this quarter. Its still hard not to see a path at least 150 basis points of gross margin expansion. So what am I missing there? Ian M. Cook: About 50 basis points. I think if you take India and the promotional intensity, actually India from doctor\u2019s point of view was never particularly intense in our categories, now if you look at India, you know Bina I talked about the market share, we're approaching 55 and the competitor in question has about a 0.7 shares. So and our business there continues to be quite strong. In terms of Brazil, I would say yes the promotional intensity has dropped off a little bit in Brazil, which is a good thing. On gross margin Jason and I\u2019m sorry with the glib response, but the gross margin is really one of phasing because as I tried to explain earlier we think that gross margin expansion is very much going to build across the year, because although we see the headline lowering of commodity costs and certainly oil the work through of that from our inventory point of view to its effect on resins, bottles, et cetera will take some time to be seen. And on the flip side the transaction impact, you know when ForEx goes to Guinea that hits you straight away whether it\u2019s the stuff you have to pay and your payables whether it\u2019s the dollar denominated raw materials that replace that what you are now having to pay for. So that\u2019s immediate and the win back on the gross margin take a little bit more time. So I do think we\u2019ll next year in a strengthened position gross margin wise, but it really is all to do with phasing. So I believe these were all the questions we have. End of Q& A Operator : Yes sir. Ian M. Cook: Okay, so well thanks very much for catching up with us today and a special thank you all the Colgate folks that make it happen. Bye-bye. Operator : And with that ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's call. We would like to thank you for your participation.",

Now for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President and Investor Relations, Bina Thompson. Please go ahead, Bina. Delia H. Thompson: Thank you, Danny, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. We're pleased with how this year has started out, with solid organic sales growth and encouraging growth margin improvement despite the major currency headwinds we have been facing. Our business is on track. And as Ian said in this morning's press release, our anticipated full year earnings per share decline reflects a double-digit increase on a currency-neutral basis, of course, excluding restructuring charges. And as you'll hear in more detail shortly, we made very good market share progress across categories and divisions. This is a result of ongoing innovation around the world, supported by a healthy level of advertising. And while our reported advertising was down absolutely versus the year-ago quarter, the 10.6% level as a percent of sales is up meaningfully from the fourth quarter 2014 level of 9.7% and compares to a level in last year's first quarter of 11.1%, the highest for last year. And as we've said on many occasions, it's the combination of this reported advertising and our very impactful in-store activities which drive volume and market share growth. And our efforts in the area of efficiency continued to pay off, with our Funding the Growth initiatives off to a very good start. In fact, it's the strongest first quarter we've had in that area in some time. In addition, our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track and delivering the savings we had projected. And as referenced in the press release, our balance sheet is strong. Working capital levels are below last year. So let's turn to the divisions, starting with North America. Our North American business continues to grow. As mentioned in the press release, our year-to-date market share is up in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes. In addition, it's up in mouthwash, body wash, liquid hand soap and fabric conditioner. In the toothpaste whitening category, the February launch of Colgate Optic White Platinum Express White has added incremental share. Our year-to-date share for whitening is 5.8%, which grew to 6.8% in March. Part of our successful integrated marketing campaign included the use of YouTube beauty experts to engage our millennial consumer. Another 2015 toothpaste innovation is Colgate Enamel Health Multi-Protection toothpaste, which includes premium packaging. In the body wash category, our year-to-date share is up over a full point to almost 10%. Our February launches of both Irish Spring Signature For Men and Softsoap Fresh & Glow have contributed to these results. And our liquid hand soap share is at 31.4% year-to-date, with the most recent share at 33.1%, largely driven by the Softsoap Fragrant Foaming Collection. We're also very pleased with our Tom's of Maine business, which is growing very strongly. Innovation as well as increased distribution have played a role. We're getting good traction with our recent launch of a line of baby products. Our in-store execution has been excellent, including a very impactful Earth Day event. And you'll hear about more new products later in the year. So let's turn then to Europe/South Pacific. Momentum is strong across this division, and market shares are growing. Our strong organic volume growth of 5.5% is the highest in almost 5 years. Our year-to-date market share is up in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, liquid hand soap, shower gel and fabric conditioner. Our year-to-date toothpaste share is at 36.4%, up 40 basis points, with the most recent reading at 37%. Toothpaste innovation this quarter includes Colgate Total Daily Repair. This new product helps reverse early damage for better oral health. It's an everyday multi-benefit toothpaste with proactive repair benefits and is priced at a premium to the base business. In the whitening category, we're launching Colgate Max White for men with powerful stain removal for whiter teeth. And more toothpaste innovation is planned for the second half of this year. Our manual toothbrush share is up 2 full points to 26.9% on a year-to-date basis, with the most recent share at 27.2%. And innovative products such as Colgate 360\u00b0 and Colgate Slim Soft toothbrushes reported by excellent in-store execution have helped drive these results. The U.K. and Australia had particularly good performance, with year-to-date toothbrush shares up 660 basis points and 240 basis points, respectively, clearly strengthening already robust leadership positions. In the Personal Care category, we're also launching a new men's variance, Palmolive Men Fresh Care. This is a 3-in-1 product, which combines a face, body and hair wash in one convenient package. We told you last quarter about a new line under the Sanex brand, Sanex ADVANCED. This has had excellent trade acceptance and in-store implementation. We expect that share results should follow soon. Our year-to-date fabric conditioner share is up 80 basis points to 27.4%, with the most recent period at 27.7%. This was helped by the launch of Soupline Paradise Sensations, which brings new trends to the fabric conditioner category with its powerful bundle impact and sophisticated fragrances. The pipeline of products moving forward is strong, with the relaunch of Soupline Perfect Glide and Magic Moments, offering easy ironing and superior long-lasting fragrance. The new premium look with outstanding on-shelf impact and a high-performing formula commands a premium price. Turning then to Latin America. Organic sales growth was strong in this region, despite a strong year-ago comparison. And as elsewhere, premium innovation has helped drive results. Our regional toothpaste share is up 150 basis points to 77.7% on a year-to-date basis, with good gains in many countries. In Brazil, we're up 40 basis points year-over-year to 71.7%, while our nearest competitor has seen sequential declines in the last 3 bimonthly share periods. In Mexico, we're up 110 basis points to 80.6% and this despite continued promotional pressure from some of our competitors. In manual toothbrushes, premium offerings such as Colgate 360\u00b0 and Colgate Slim Soft have contributed to share growth in many countries. In Mexico, our leadership share increased 80 basis points to 43.1% on a year-to-date basis, widening the gap between our nearest competitor to 150 basis points. In Colombia, our year-to-date share increased 30 basis points to 46.7%. In bar soap, the year has started strong, with the division holding market leadership at 30.7%. Both equities, Palmolive and Protex, continued to be the #1 and #2 brands across Latin America. And we achieved record high shares in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala. Our market-leading fabric conditioner business in Mexico expanded its market share by 50 basis points to 47.2% on a year-to-date basis. Newly launched Suavitel Aroma Intense achieved a 1.4% share in the direct trade in the first quarter. And a new smaller base business size helped compete with low-priced local competitors in the bodega retail environment. Innovation in Latin America continues this quarter across categories. To build on our success in the whitening category, we are launching Luminous White Advanced toothpaste in Brazil. This is Colgate's most advanced whitening toothpaste, which intensifies the white of your teeth 3 shades whiter. Its unique formula contains the same ingredient dentists use, and you can feel it working while you brush. As a companion product, we will offer Colgate 360\u00b0 Luminous White toothbrush, with stain-erasing cups and a 2x whitening action. In the mid-tier segment and as a companion to our Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Neutrazucar toothpaste, we are relaunching Colgate Zig Zag Maximum Cavity Protection toothbrush. The product has multi-angled bristles and a flexible neck which help with plaque removal. And in the Personal Care category, we have just launched a new line under the Protex brand. Protex Complete 12 body wash, hand soap and bar soap, providing long-lasting antibacterial protection. Turning then to Asia. As you've seen, organic sales performance in this region was somewhat muted this quarter. But going forward, we have a full pipeline of new products to reignite growth. In India, our toothpaste share is up 30 basis points to 54.6% on a year-to-date basis, fueled by the launch of Colgate Active Salt and Colgate Max Fresh. In the Philippines, our toothpaste share increased 120 basis points to 60.9%, with the most recent read at 61.2%. Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste has achieved almost a 3% share of that market. Our manual toothbrush shares increased in 5 of 10 countries around the region, with our divisional year-to-date share at 29.9%, down modestly from the year-ago period but still the market leading position. And we continue to grow our mouthwash business. Our regional share is up 30 basis points to 24% on a year-to-date basis. In India, Colgate Plax Active Salt and Colgate Plax Visible White helped drive our market share up 100 basis points to 18.2%, while in the Philippines, Colgate Plax Jasmine Tea was a major driver of a 220 basis point increase to 26.8%, with the most recent read at 27.9%. And in the second quarter, the innovation continues. In toothpaste, we will launch Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair & Prevent, which repairs the sensitive areas of teeth and with regular use, provides lasting protection to prevent sensitivity from returning. In the base sensitivity line comes Colgate Sensitive with Sensifoam to reach all areas of the teeth. For the Thai market, we're launching Colgate Salt Charcoal. And as you know, charcoal is an attractive ingredient to consumers in this region based on local insights. In manual toothbrushes, we've just introduced Colgate Slim Soft Gold Charcoal toothbrush, with less than 0.01 millimeters slim tip antibacterial bristles for deep but gentle cleaning. And we're extending charcoal to the value portion of our toothbrush business with Colgate Zig Zag Charcoal toothbrush. In personal care in Thailand, we will launch a line of soap, body wash and hand soap, Protex Omega 3, body wash with Omega 3 essential oil and which washes away 99.9% of bacteria while keeping your skin feeling moisturized. Also in that market, we will introduce Protex Intimate Care feminine wash, the bundle now selling in Brazil. Turning to Africa/Eurasia. Organic sales in this region were strong, building on the momentum we saw as we exited 2014. And innovation has driven these good results across categories. Our regional toothpaste share is up 90 basis points year-to-date to 33.7%, with market share increases in virtually every country. Our share in Russia was up 160 basis points; in South Africa, 120 basis points; and in Turkey, 130 basis points. Similarly, our toothbrush share increased everywhere with the exception of East-West Africa. Shares in Russia, South Africa and Turkey increased 170 basis points, 90 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively. Our bar soap share was also up across the region, up 290 basis points year-to-date. In South Africa, our share increased 180 basis points to 32.4%, thanks to the new products we told you about in previous quarters : Protex Men and Protex African Therapy. And more innovation is planned for this quarter. In toothpaste, we will be launching Colgate Optic White Whiten and Restore. The formula with an active mineral complex and fresh mint flavor provides 1 shade whiter teeth in 1 week while helping to restore enamel strength. And the consumer can have the confidence of always being able to look her best without compromising the health of her mouth. In Russia, following on the success of our Altai Herbs bundle, we will be introducing Colgate Plax Forte Oak Bark & Fir mouthwash. Oak Bark & Fir are attractive ingredients to consumers in this part of the world based on local insights. And in the shower gel category, we are adding a new variant to our successful Palmolive Spa Gourmet line, Mint Shake, with an uplifting mint fragrance and rich creamy formula infused with natural mint extracts that leave your skin feeling pampered. To build on our success in bar soaps, we're launching Protex Complete 12, similar to the bundle launching across Latin America. And Hill's. Hill's solid organic sales growth was a good balance between volume and price, both here and overseas. In addition, it's encouraging that gross profit margin is up year-over-year. As you may recall, we indicated this would indeed happen despite initial costs associated with reformulation of new and existing products. And we're pleased that in the U.S. market, retail consumption in the large format retailers is up nicely. Among the drivers are our new premium Hill's Science Diet offerings, which have been supported in-store with impactful displays and are growing faster than the rest of the Hill's Science Diet line. This quarter, we've begun a 10-week turnaround campaign to support Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight. The objective here is to educate consumers about pet weight loss, creating awareness and buzz around the product to drive trial. Consumer engagement activities will be both in-store and online. Hill's Ideal Balance also continued to perform well. Hill's Ideal Balance Crafted was launched in the first quarter. This new sub-line with its premium positioning offers authentic ingredients prepared with care. A full support campaign has included new product kits and feeding trials along with online ratings and reviews. The packaging and messaging relaunch of our Hill's Prescription Diet line is off to a good start. Here in the U.S., it's received excellent feedback from the profession. The packaging is seen as being more consumer-friendly with increased and clearer descriptive. And this is now rolling out across Europe. So in summary, we're very pleased with the way 2015 has started out. The momentum we saw as we exited 2014 has continued in many regions of the world. Our new product pipeline is full across all categories, and our ongoing savings programs as well as our Global Growth and Efficiency Program are providing funds to support that robust innovation. And as we implement our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, our people are becoming even more focused on winning on the ground each and every day. We look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go forward through the year. And now, Danny, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Ian, I was hoping you could just provide us the quick gross margin bridge. And then the broader question is, from a competitive standpoint, just curious if you could just give us a State of the Union on what you're seeing in some of the key markets in terms of some of the competitor activity. Are you seeing a scale back in some promotion -- promotional spend, especially in some of those markets where one of your competitors has really been making a push over the last 2 to 3 years? Ian M. Cook: Okay, Nik. Happy to do the gross profit walk-through. So if you take our first quarter, the first quarter of 2014, the gross margin was 58.6%. We pick up a positive benefit of pricing at 1 percentage point. Between Funding the Growth and a very modest contribution from restructuring, we pick up another 170 basis points. And as Bina said in her remarks, you can see that, that places us with a far quicker start on our Funding the Growth in 2015 than we had prior year because of the intense focus we have put there. Material prices were a headwind of 230 basis points, and that was almost wholly a transaction impact. There's another 10 basis points of other, and that gets you to the current year of gross profit of 58.9%. We were very pleased with the 30 basis points improvement we had in the first quarter. Indeed, many external views saw our gross profit coming down because of that foreign exchange transaction impact. And we like to think that the balance we're finding between pricing, between Funding the Growth, between Global Growth and Efficiency, driving our innovation and meeting competitive marketplace needs is allowing us to grow the top line while, at the same time, increasing our gross margin. And as we said on the last call, and it remains true for this year, we expect our gross margin to continue to build across the year. And we still plan to expand that gross margin on the year between 50 and 100 basis points. So I think that captures the gross margin approach and thinking from our side. In terms of the marketplaces, I wouldn't say we have seen anything holistically different. We see in pockets increased promotional activity. We see in other pockets increased couponing activity. And we see in other locations, frankly, an easing in the promotional environment. We do see quite a lot of pullback from our principal competitors in media advertising across the first quarter of the year. And I would say our reaction to it is as our reaction has always been, we balance between driving trial for our innovation and meeting promotional needs when they are there, but at the same time, growing and growing our gross margin. And that continues to be our view of the external environment promotionally for the balance of the year. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Dara Mohsenian. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : So, Ian, pricing decelerated sequentially on a year-over-year basis in Q1 versus Q4, and I'm just trying to get a sense of what drove that. Are you seeing a more competitive manufacturer environment in terms of promotion as you just talked about? Is it more related to consumer demand elasticity? I guess I would have expected it to build giving greater FX. And then can you talk a little bit about plans in the balance of the year to cover any additional FX pressure? Ian M. Cook: Yes. We were actually quite pleased with the pricing in the first quarter. You're right. As always, you're balancing your speed of response with what is there in the marketplace and the consumer. We do expect our pricing to build across the year. As you correctly say, we use pricing along with other vehicles to offset that transaction impact of foreign exchange. But I return to the point that I think we're working very hard to maintain that right balance, so we can invest to grow market share and drive the top line while increasing our gross margin. And we feel we started the year in a good place with that 30 margin point expansion, knowing that pricing takes a little bit of time to catch up with the foreign exchange impact. So more pricing across the balance of the year and reiterating the plan to expand our gross margin, again, across the balance of the year to increase by 50 to 100 basis points for the full year. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Faucher with JPMorgan. John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : A little bit of a follow-up on Dara's question, Ian, which is more about the mechanics of pricing and especially when you have this much volatility. And so I guess, how do we look at sort of the time frame that it takes to react to some of this emerging market currency volatility in the transactional FX? Is it something where the pricing goes in relatively quickly? Or do you sort of have to wait for things to stabilize as we look at sort of how to balance, again, some of the wild movements in the currency and whether or not if you price for transactional and then the currency moves in your favor, there's an additional spread that works in your favor? Ian M. Cook: Yes. It's -- in some situations where the marketplace change is significant and dire, we, along with others, tend to take significant pricing steps very quickly. Russia would be a very clear example. In others, we are more balanced in doing it. If I broaden the discussion a little bit and you think about selling price increases, in fact, our selling price increases in the quarter were between 4% and 5%. Then with some of the activities we have at the store level, we spent some of that back. So you end up with the net pricing number, which is what you see at 2.4% and on balance between the two, still grew gross profit by 30 basis points and kept advertising at a healthy level of 10.6%. So that's what we tend to be juggling with as we balance gross pricing with how we execute in the marketplace. And our responsiveness will be as the market dictates, and our balance between the gross and the effective pricing will reflect also marketplace needs. But again, that balance will see our gross margin expand as the year unfolds by 50 to 100 basis points, which sees us with our traditional advertising up absolutely and as a percent of sales on the year. Operator : From Citi Research, we have Wendy Nicholson. Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : My question was on Hill's. And it looks to me that the operating margin is kind of back to close to an all-time high level, which is awesome. But over the last few years, it seems like when margin has crept up, then you soon thereafter lose share, and there's kind of been a trade-off. And I'm wondering, number one, if you can comment on that and whether there's been more structural change so that we really should think that a 27-plus percent operating margin is sustainable for Hill's, combined with an outlook for top line growth. And also, as the Hill's business sort of expands, I know you've entered some new markets like Eastern Europe and Latin America, I assume you're not opening up manufacturing yet in those places. So is there a risk that there is more transactional cost to the business as currencies move and you don't have local manufacturing for that business specifically? Ian M. Cook: Yes. The Hill's consumption is very strong. And I think all of these are a balance between the value of the consumer believes that they are paying for and the gross margin that, that delivers. So Bina went through much of the innovation that we can so far talk about on the Hill's business thus far this year, and a large part of that is accretive from a gross margin point of view. So we're creating innovation that is margin-accretive that the consumer is attracted to. So you will remember, when we went through the process of turning Hill's around, we said one of the key strategic things we wanted to do was to make the innovation flow in Hill's sustainable, not episodic. And we have that now. So yes, we do believe, and it was part of our plan when we made the investment in gross margin, that we would return to historical levels. Now from a local country expansion point of view, we're not in any new markets compared to the emerging markets that we had already been in, like Russia, like Brazil, like Mexico, those types of marketplace. And indeed, we do have a transaction burden because we don't make Hill's products in Russia, for example. But all of that is based into our business plan. We make the same pricing adjustments to address the transaction impact on Hill's as we do for the Colgate business. And maybe strategically down the road one day, if we were to invest in capacity, of course, that would give us further margin improvement on those businesses. The other comment I would make is we are finding with Hill's and our engagement with the Hill's consumer that the emotional connection is so rich that you can engage with that consumer through digital vehicles almost entirely because they will spend extraordinarily (sic) [extraordinary] time finding out information, and they will spend extraordinary time with Hill's representatives to take care of their pets. So with that business, in particular, we're building a very efficient model of targeting and reaching the consumer given the emotional investment they have in the category of the brand and, of course, their pet. So long story short, we think it's sustainable. Operator : From Goldman Sachs, we have Jason English. Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I'm looking at Asia, Africa/Eurasia combined. Sort of what you used to report as Greater Asia and Africa. And the organic sales growth blended of 2 1 [ph] is the weakest we've seen since the third quarter of 2014. And it looks like it's really coming on softness in Asia. I noticed in the press release you referenced to volume declines in China. And I think last quarter, you said the destock was behind you. So I was hoping you could just drill a little bit deeper into what's happening in the Asia segment, why price sort of rolled negative, why volume is still relatively soft and, more specifically, what's happening in China. Ian M. Cook: Yes. Fair questions, Jason. And obviously, your math is correct. And indeed, the country that bears comment is China. And so let me make a few remarks around China because that really is the country, the geography to discuss. I think the first thing to say is that you will remember, we were one of the first to recognize that trade destocking was occurring in the second quarter last year. And we said that destocking process would be completed by the end of 2014, and the trade inventories would be back to balance. And that has happened. The inventory destocking is completed in China. If you look at our consumption in China, which is to say, the consumer's purchases of our products, our quarter 1 consumption was up a healthy mid-single digits, in line with the marketplace. Our January, February market share was up meaningfully from the fourth quarter of 2014 when the destocking ended. And indeed, our local sales in China for the first quarter were up behind that strong consumption, meaningfully, fourth quarter to first quarter. Now the comparison with the first quarter of 2014 is down due to the comparison with what was our highest quarter in 2014, which, again, you will remember was the quarter before the down-stocking occurred. So what I'm saying is our consumption is leading our sales back up. Our market share and that consumption predict continued growth in sales. And I think most importantly, the second quarter in China is off to a brisk start. So consumption is good and that future growth for that business will continue to build. Operator : We have Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : First question is just on pricing in North America. It was up for the first time in probably about 2 years. So is the couponing starting to lap? Is competition improving? And then also specifically on pricing in Brazil. Is -- are you planning to raise prices? And I ask in the context of Brazil volume having declined in the March quarter. And then finally on the organic sales outlook for the full year. With the first quarter sort of at the low end of your longer-term outlook in the sort of 4% to 7% range, can you just talk through that a little bit? Ian M. Cook: Yes. Well, in the U.S., obviously, we were pleased with the pricing pickup in the first quarter. And yes, I would say there has been some modulation in the promotion activity. And indeed, you will remember, the first quarter for us last year was the quarter in which we had launched many, many of our new products. And of course, the couponing behind the trial for those new products would have been in the first quarter of 2014. So there's a timing aspect to that as well. We have, indeed, taken pricing in Brazil. But I would comment on Brazil that it is a different story to China and that the marketplace economic activity and, indeed, our categories worsened since the last time we spoke in January. I don't think that's new news to everyone. It has been widely reported. Pleasingly, as Bina said, our market share, approaching 72%, is up year-on-year. In fact, when I was down there 2 weeks ago, the General Manager said with great pride that it was the highest market share in 19 years. But who's looking? And so our shares continue to be strong, i.e. we're growing faster than the market growth. And as you would imagine, given our experience in Latin America, we're doing a very, shall we say, attentive job of managing our cost structure. But I think it's fair to say that we should expect, and indeed, we are planning for, a slower Brazil marketplace for the balance of this year. Now the organic growth outcome, I think you can do your own math. We provided a range of 4% to 7% because of the choppiness and volatility in our world. And if -- to put that in comparison, that 4% is up against the highest quarter of last year at 6.5%. So the compares ease a little bit as we go forward. And if the China growth returns the way we expect it to, it will clearly move us up that range. So we're still comfortable with the 4% to 7% range, and we'll see how it unfolds quarter-by-quarter. Operator : And we'll take Steve Powers from UBS. Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So I think previously -- this is a little bit of housekeeping maybe. But I think you had called out FX as a 7%, 7.5% headwind to the top line for the year a few months ago and a 10% headwind on the bottom line from a translation standpoint. And I apologize if I missed it, but could you just call out specifically how that's evolved as you see it? Because I'm wondering if the effective 2- to 4-point reduction in all-in EPS is 100% FX versus other factors on the margin like Brazil, which you mentioned. And if I could squeeze in a related follow-up. What would trigger -- on FX, what would trigger a move to the SIMADI rate in Venezuela for you? And how incrementally impactful would you expect it to be on kind of a pro forma 12-month basis? Because it just feels like it's essentially a matter of time before that needs to happen. Ian M. Cook: Yes. Well, to take the second point which is housekeeping, you will find that broken out in our Q. So we actually provide the calculation where they're a requirement that we do that, which is to say what would the impact on the business be if we were required to go to the SIMADI rate. The foreign exchange impact on the year is around 10%, more or less. It is more on the bottom line as it was in the first quarter. I think top to bottom was 10% and 14% on the first quarter. So it's about a 10% impact on the year. There are no other factors affecting our guidance other than, and I stress, the translation impact of foreign exchange because as you know well, we seek to cover the transaction impact because that is what leads to operating results. Operator : And we'll take Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Can you talk about the growth opportunity in Home Care and Personal Care? Only because like Oral Care is sort of indisputable given your market shares. But it seems like in those categories, there's a lot more local competition and commodities are rolling over. I look at some of the data, I'm not sure the syndicated data is great, but like you look at Home Care in Venezuela, and it was like the business in bolivars was up sort of 50% year-over-year in 2014 versus '13. So I'm just wondering what you think of the outlook there to have that continue to grow and then maybe it's an opportunity because people are exiting the market. So maybe I'm looking at it the wrong way. And since you guys are the last guys standing, maybe it's better than I would have otherwise thought. So any thoughts would be appreciated. Ian M. Cook: Yes. Well, I don't like being categorized as the last guy standing. And Venezuela is a unique case. So I don't know what data you're seeing, Bill, but our Home Care business is not a focus for us in Venezuela. And indeed, material availability is modest in that business. I think as you heard Bina talk, we're quite pleased with our Home Care and our Personal Care business. Yes, there are more competitors in Personal Care than we find in Oral Care. But if you take Personal Care against the company, Personal Care organic grew around 3% in the first quarter, quite healthy growth. And more competitors means the marketplace is more fragmented, and therefore, you can garner progress because there are simply more players in the space. And I think some of the examples Bina quoted are very good examples of where we're doing precisely that in emerging markets as well as developed markets. So no, we still think there is opportunity for growth in those categories, and we're going after it. Operator : We'll take Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Just a quick clarification. I just missed something and then to the core question here. I apologize. So you said FX will be a 10% impact on the bottom line. But in the... Ian M. Cook: No, on the top line. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : On the top line. Okay, fine. Sorry. I missed that. Okay. If you go to kind of the pricing and dig down a little bit further in kind of 2 buckets, one is Asia at negative 1% and then Europe, negative 4.5%, how do you think that goes going forward? So do you think that kind of negative pressure will continue on those marketplaces where it's going down? And then on where the pricing has been driving your overall pricing, so Latin America and Africa/Eurasia, both in kind of 7.5%, 8% range. Both of those, as you comment, are driven by highly inflationary areas. So Venezuela, as an example, in Latin America, call it, 50% or 60% inflation, it's 3% of your business, overall, 10% of that region, Africa/Eurasia, Russia, obviously, the driver there or one of the potential drivers there. And thereto, what do you think the sustainability is of that? And if you were to pull out Venezuela and Russia in those pricings, what would it be? Sustainably both of the negative, so the bad stuff and then potentially the good stuff on pricing. Ian M. Cook: Wow. Where to start? The -- if we take pricing overall, and you may have missed the response we gave a little bit earlier, we continue to believe we have pricing power. And therefore, the growth pricing we've been able to take is around 4.5%. And we have reinvested some of that in the trade spending activity to grow market share, which, along with the traditional advertising we have invested, have continued to be productive. We are growing market shares broadly, and we are seeing our gross margin expand. We think in terms of the pricing in Africa/Eurasia and Latin America that, that is sustainable. We're not, again, going to talk about Venezuela specifically other than to say when we got pricing in the fourth quarter of last year, so did many of our competitors. And regardless of what the inflation is in a country, in Venezuela's case, pricing is controlled by the government. So we don't have the flexibility to follow the inflation with self-directed pricing in Venezuela. So Venezuela is all rollover in 2015. I would also say that we have very broad-based pricing increases across all of Latin America. You forgot Hill's, where I think we've got a very good balance between effective pricing and volume growth on that business and beginning to see the gross margin build back nicely, which was clearly one of our objectives. The U.S., North America pricing possibility, that will always be a bit choppy, given the timing of couponing behind new products and the fact that couponing goes into price. And I think there will continue to be pricing pressure in Europe, but our expectation is that it will ease over the balance of the year compared to the first quarter level. Now in Asia, specific to China, we made some corrective pricing actions on a couple of our businesses, which are now baked in for the full year. I think that was responding to all the questions you asked, Ali, at least I hope so. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division : And forgive me if you've touched on this. There's a lot of stuff here. But advertising growth for the full year, do you expect the actual recorded number to be up in local currency and in dollars would be the first thing. And then just on China, there's been a move to premiumization in many categories, and toothpaste is one of them. The local toothpaste I think is a premium product. Are you doing anything -- I know your Darlie brand is very successful, but within the Colgate brand, are you doing things to premiumize and try to take advantage of that? Ian M. Cook: Yes. Yes, we are. I mean, on the advertising side, when we look at advertising spending for the year, we see, on a ratio basis, an increase year-on-year. In local currency terms, it will certainly be up. It will certainly be up. The -- from a China point of view, you're absolutely right. There is a fair degree of premiumization going on in China, and we indeed are taking advantage of that. When you put China in a longer context, over the last 8 years, we built our China business from about a 29 share to a market-leading 33, 34 share, 34 share January, February this year. If you look at our principal multinational competitor, they've gone from 25, down to under 15. And the other multinational competitor has gone down from mid-teens to high single digits. And that premium local brand you mentioned is what is taking up the slack. So we're continuing to hold market position quite nicely. And indeed, we are adopting a premiumization strategy. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Ian, you alluded to kind of the pullback in marketing from the competition earlier. And there's been some talk about your largest competitor meaningfully pulling back on kind of media spend over the next few months or few quarters. How do you look at that? Is that some -- an opportunity to keep the foot on the pedal? Or is there just too much marketing and advertising out there? Maybe everybody can benefit a little bit. Ian M. Cook: The -- I would say when we think about our -- I'm now talking the traditional advertising media. I would say that our focus is more on what is necessary to reach, engage and convince our consumers to stay with our brands from an emotional point of view and to try our innovation. That's the purpose. And that dictates a certain reach and frequency for your traditional media. These days, it also requires a mix between the traditional and the digital and other ways of connecting with people. If some of these pullbacks continue to be as we have seen them, maybe it does create a little bit more of a rational opportunity in some markets. But we'll track that for a while before we make any significant changes. Operator : From Raymond James, we have Joe Altobello. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Two quick questions on SG&A. I guess, first, in terms of overhead, a little surprised it was up this quarter. Was that all FX-driven? And then secondly, if you could remind us what you're expecting in terms of total restructuring savings this year. Ian M. Cook: Yes. The -- you're right on the overhead, Joe. In fact, total dollar expenses were down. So the reason the ratio is up is a combination of timing and dollar-denominated expenses against a weakening foreign exchange-driven top line. As to your second point, I think we have in our K -- I think we're talking 65 to 75 after-tax for the year -- sorry, that was the restructuring. Operator : And we have Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I feel like most of this has actually been covered. So I'm just going to leave it alone and let you proceed to the next person. Operator : We'll go ahead and move on to Eddy Hargreaves with Canaccord. Eddy Hargreaves - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division : Two questions, actually. Sorry to harp on about the advertising spend. Ian M. Cook: Harp away, harp away. Eddy Hargreaves - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division : You answered the last person who asked you this in terms of ratios, but I think what you were saying, implying that you think that worldwide advertising investment will be up for the full year in absolute terms, just is down 10% to $430 million in the quarter. If that's right, I'm slightly surprised because it implies quite a step-up in the next 3 quarters, given your overall sort of commentary about the media environment. Perhaps you could square that circle somewhat. Ian M. Cook: Maybe I misspoke. Let me answer the first one first and then you can ask the second one so we don't lose the point. It will be up in local currency, on a currency-neutral basis. And it will be up on a ratio basis. The dollars will be broadly in line, maybe modestly down, year-on-year. And your second question? Eddy Hargreaves - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division : Okay. Yes. And the other one was, there's been some sort of comment earlier on in the questioning about the North American pricing looking a bit better. You obviously said that it tends to be choppy. But if we look at the overall organic performance top line in North America, it looks as weak as it's been for quite a few quarters sort of looking back across the spreadsheet as it were. Perhaps you could sort of give some sense of how you see the North American consumer environment generally, given potential oil price-based benefits to consumers, that type of thing. Are you fairly confident that the environment will look better in H2 than H1, for example? Ian M. Cook: Who knows? I mean, the first quarter economic numbers were just revised down. I think there is an underlying confidence that the U.S. economy is on the turn, but I think it's a slow turn. Frankly, our consumption in the U.S. is ahead of the consolidated growth in the categories we're in, that U.S. category growth is between 1% and 2%. We're slap-banging that. And as Bina commented in her remarks, our market shares are up in North America. So we're quite pleased with that. And we will be poised to take advantage of the growth should it accelerate because we have a rich array of innovation to bring to the marketplace. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: My question actually has to do with Brazil. Is it that -- we heard from your competitors, L'Or\u00e9al, Unilever, that category growth was flat in terms of volume. But your volumes are actually down. And then you're telling us that you're gaining share. So then the question is, is it that the calculation has to do because people are trading down within Colgate's portfolio and that's why you are getting negative volumes. Or is it that at the end of the day, you are overrepresented in channels that are losing market share, say, large format retailers and that's how we reconcile the fact that you have strong shares, but actually, your volumes are negative, which your competitors are not posting negative volumes? Ian M. Cook: The -- I guess all these countries have to be a balance between volume and price, given the transaction impact of the foreign exchange. So in Brazil, we took pricing and we took pricing against volume, to your point, to establish the pricing in the marketplace. At the same time, because of the economic decline, several of the categories did go negative in volume terms. So not all the categories were positive from a volume point of view. The other thing one has to say, and I spent 3 days down there not so long ago, is there is quite a bit of short-term disruption in the marketplace. The economy slows down. You have the various scandals unfolding day after day. Interest rates go up. And what happens is the indirect retailers take a step back and wait to see how everything is going to settle out. So there is an added element, I would say, of short-term hesitation in terms of the way the market would normally line up. But as I said earlier, our focus is going to be on growing market share, controlling our costs, expanding gross margin and weathering what we believe will be a slower Brazil environment for the balance of this year. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : So two questions. One, just wanted to get an update on the Tom's of Maine expansion and sort of your thoughts thus far, bigger opportunity, smaller opportunity than maybe you had thought originally. And then housekeeping, is there any impact on cash usage, CapEx, share repo, dividend, et cetera, from FX? Ian M. Cook: The Tom's business is doing very well. The first quarter organic growth was up double digits. We have, as you know, an extremely strong position in Oral Care toothpaste in the United States, over 50 market share in the channels that are unique to Tom's. And that's why, as Bina said, we have taken the opportunity now that we have consolidated our position in toothpaste to extend the Tom's name into the baby skin health space, which we think will be a big opportunity for Tom's going forward. As I have said before, this is not a marketing accelerated business. You have to win consumers one at a time and be patient. But once they are Tom's consumers, they're Tom's consumers forever. And they almost pledge allegiance to the brand, which we may have them do one day. In terms of cash usage, no major change in CapEx or repurchase. No major change. So listen, I understand those are all the questions on the line. I thank you very much for your interest in the company. And as always, I thank Colgate people around the world for making it all happen. Talk to you next time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's presentation. We appreciate everyone's participation.",

Now for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Bina Thompson. Please go ahead, Bina. Bina H. Thompson - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, Jessica. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings release conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. We're very pleased with the continued strong organic sales growth in our business across all divisions. In fact, the pace of such growth has accelerated nearly everywhere. Innovation continues to play an important role in our successful array of new products across categories has resulted in strong and growing market shares. As Ian said in the press release, our robust organic sales growth is particularly notable in the face of challenging macroeconomic conditions in many markets; however, foreign exchange continues to be an even more significant headwind, and that is continuing into the third quarter. And as you know, we're diligent in taking pricing to offset currency-related transaction costs and are pleased that even with the pricing we have taken, there is still a good balance with volumes. Our savings programs are delivering excellent results both our ongoing Funding the Growth initiatives as well as our Global Growth and Efficiency program. Cash generation is solid and our working capital is low, down year-over-year. So, we think we're making good progress in 2015 and have good plans in place to keep up the momentum. So, let's turn to the divisions; starting with North America; we're pleased with the solid organic sales growth in North America this quarter and acceleration from the first quarter 2015 growth, driven by a solid volume increase of 3%. And as mentioned in the press release, U.S. market shares are strong across many categories. Innovation continues to play a critical role; although, we also see strengths in the base business. For instance, Colgate Total toothpaste continues to maintain a market share of around 10%. In the first quarter, we launched Colgate Total mouthwash for gum health, which allowed us to drive the regimen concept in-store with a claim of 45% stronger, healthier gums versus non-antibacterial mouthwash. The mouthwash is off to a great start. It's the number one new item at a major U.S. retailer. In toothbrushes, our newest addition to the Colgate 360\u00b0 line is Colgate 360\u00b0 Optic White Platinum. This has been incremental in the line. Colgate 360\u00b0 has come from a 13% share for full-year 2011 to a 19.3% share of the total category year-to-date. And as we said in the press release, our leadership manual toothbrush here is now well over 40% at 41.4%. We're particularly pleased with the performance of our Tom's of Maine business. Sales are growing healthy double-digits with the strongest growth in our top 10 retailers. With the expansion of our shopper marketing initiative, we achieved our first-ever end aisle displays in many customers during our well executed April Earth Month integrated marketing campaign. Our new Tom's baby line is off to a very encouraging start with wide acceptance across retail channels. The line is receiving positive online consumer reviews and the body lotion and hair body wash products are within the top SKUs ranking in selling ahead of many other big and established baby brands. The fastest-growing segment within fabric conditioners is scent boosters. We launched Suavitel Fragrance Pearls in-wash scent boosters in March of this year with the claim of five times longer-lasting fragrance versus detergent alone. Distribution continues to build within major accounts, and our year-to-date share in the overall category is at 18.7%, up 70 basis points, with our second quarter share at a record 19.5%. Looking ahead in the third quarter, we'll be launching Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste, which helps reverse early damage for better oral health and goes beyond promoting traditional benefits to a new consumer relevant space, with the best testing Colgate Total concept ever. And as you can imagine, we'll be backed by a full support plan including TV, PR and social media, professional and multicultural outreach and of course in-store shopper activity. As you know, in the second half of 2014, we launched Colgate Enamel Health toothpaste. In the first quarter, this year, we added Colgate Enamel Health Multi-Protection toothpaste to the Enamel footprint. And now in the third quarter, we're adding Colgate Enamel Health mouthwash to provide a complete regimen solution. This new mouthwash helps replenish natural calciums, reverses enamel softening and helps prevent cavities, all with a great-tasting flavor. And finally, in the Kids' segment, we're launching the first-ever regimen portfolio with Minions branding across the toothpaste, toothbrush and mouthwash categories. Turning then to Europe/South Pacific; we're pleased with the acceleration in organic sales growth in this region from the first quarter. Continued innovation has contributed to the results. Consequently, our regional year-to-date market shares are up in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouth rinse, body wash, liquid hand soap, underarm protection and fabric conditioner. The regional launch of our premium priced Colgate Max White One Optic toothpaste has been incremental to our share in the whitening category and has helped to increase overall toothpaste share in France, Italy and Spain. In addition, in France, a strong integrated marketing campaign has helped grow our elmex SENSITIVE toothpaste business in the mass channel. Growth in our manual toothbrush business has been driven by innovation and excellent in-store execution. The favorable gap between us and our nearest competitor has widened over the last five years from just 70 basis points to almost 7 full points on a year-to-date basis. Across Europe, our manual toothbrush share is up 150 basis points to 24.6% year-to-date. And in Australia, our share is up 170 basis points to 63.3% year-to-date, with the most recent read at 63.8%. And we told you last quarter about an exciting new innovation in Personal Care, Sanex Advanced. This is off to a very good start. The line of body washes and underarm deodorant has been incremental to the business and, in the last month, our body wash share has met or exceeded our goal in France, Spain and Belgium. Innovation continues in the second half of 2015. In the toothpaste category, we're just now launching Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent toothpaste. This premium-priced offering repairs sensitive areas of the teeth and prevents further sensitivity for instant and lasting relief. An extensive shopper marketing program will support a complete re-launch of our Colgate 360\u00b0 manual toothbrushes, which provide superior cleaning for a whole mouth clean versus an ordinary flat trimmed toothbrush. This premium-priced line, which includes Colgate 360\u00b0 Expert White and Colgate 360\u00b0 for men should help continue the excellent momentum we've seen in this category. And in our body wash business, we'll be launching Palmolive Gourmet body washes, a line of creamy body butter washes with fragrant ingredients, including vanilla, chocolate and peach, which have already been very successful in the Africa/Eurasia division. Moving on to Latin America. We're pleased with a continued strong organic sales growth in this region. Two of our largest subsidiaries in the region, Mexico and Brazil, delivered solid performance and, of particular note with Brazil, where organic sales growth accelerated nicely from the first quarter. Market shares for Latin America increased year-to-date in toothpaste, shampoo, liquid cleaners, dish washing liquid and fabric conditioners. Our regional toothpaste share is at 75.7% year-to-date, up 70 basis points, and the highest level in four years despite competitive entries during that time period. In Brazil, our year-to-date share is up 40 basis points to almost 72%, while in Mexico our year-to-date share increased 70 basis points to 81%. Our Home Care business in Mexico is extremely strong; dish liquid shares are at 52.2% year-to-date, up almost 3 points; liquid cleaner shares are at 33.5% year-to-date, up 80 basis points; and fabric conditioner shares are at 48.6% year-to-date, up almost 2 points. In the dish category, the launch of Axion Complete exceeded expectations. And our very successful Thank You Mom campaign behind Suavitel, our leading fabric conditioner, helped to further strengthen that brand equity. Our innovation pace will continue in the second half. Colgate Luminous White Advanced toothpaste will be rolled out throughout the region. This is Colgate's most advanced whitening toothpaste available in Latin America. It intensifies the white of your teeth three shades whiter with a unique formula that uses the same ingredient dentists use. Accompanying the toothpaste will be re-launches of Colgate Luminous White mouthwash and toothbrush. In the Personal Care category, we will be expanding the distribution of Protex Complete 12, a range of bar soap, liquid hand soap and body wash that provides long-lasting antibacterial protection and offers 12 times more protection than non-antibacterial bar soap. And in Home Care, we'll be introducing a rinse-free formula to our base Suavitel fabric conditioner business currently available only in premium offerings, which should further enhance our strong number-one position. Moving to Asia. We're pleased with the acceleration of organic sales growth in Asia from the first quarter. In particular, our business in China is performing well and back to solid growth. As we said in the press release, we maintain our strong leadership in toothpaste across the region. In India, our year-to-date share is stable at 54.8%, with the most recent read at 55.1%. And in China, we hold the number-one position at almost 34% year-to-date. Our toothbrush business in the Philippines is strong and growing in the Premium and Super Premium segments. Our year-to-date share is at a record 57.4%, up 70 basis points, with the most recent read at 58.3%. Our Colgate 360\u00b0 Charcoal Gold toothbrush first launched in China has been successful in this market as well. Our regional share in mouthwash is at a record 23.5% year-to-date, up 60 basis points, with particularly strong performance in the Philippines and Hong Kong. And as elsewhere, more new products are planned for the balance of the year. In China, we will be re-launching our base Colgate Anticavity toothpaste in both the whitening and all-around anti-cavity segment. Elsewhere in the region, we're excited about our Colgate Total Charcoal Deep Clean toothpaste gel, which has a unique antibacterial formula that reduces bacteria on 100% of your mouth surfaces and provides 12-hour protection for a healthier mouth. In toothbrushes, we're introducing a line extension of our Colgate Natural Essences toothbrush, which has lotus-infused bristles. In addition, across the region, we're launching Colgate Kids Spiderman and Barbie toothbrushes with 0.01 millimeter slim tip bristles. Africa/Eurasia. As elsewhere, significant currency headwinds affected our financial results in this division. The good organic sales growth of 4% was price-driven as we took pricing actions to help offset transaction costs. However, with negative 21.5% foreign exchange across the division, we couldn't recoup all the losses. So, it's encouraging that our local businesses are doing well and our market shares are generally solid. Our regional toothpaste share is up 100 basis points to 32.9% year-to-date, with our most recent read at 33%. Notably, our share in Russia increased 2 full points to 33.6% year-to-date, with the most recent read at a record-high 34.1%. Both Colgate Total and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpastes have performed very well. Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection was launched in early 2015 and it's already reached almost 1 full share point nationally and has garnered 1.2 share points in the modern trade. In Turkey, our share increased 120 basis points to 26.6% year-to-date. And in South Africa, our share was up 60 basis points to 50.3% year-to-date. Our toothbrush share is up in the 15 countries to 16 countries, which represent over 99% of our toothbrush business in the division. In Russia, incremental listings in the country's largest retailer have contributed to year-to-date share increase of 240 basis points to 47.2% with the most recent read at 47.7%. And in Turkey, our very successful Colgate Slim Soft toothbrush has helped grow our share by 150 basis points to 28.3% year-to-date. Our regional bar soap share is up 290 basis points to 22.6% year-to-date, driven by gains in our two top markets; South Africa and Russia. More innovation is planned for the second half of the year. We will be refreshing both our base business Sensitive toothpaste as well as launching our Premium Colgate Optic White toothpaste with new and more impactful graphics. In South Africa, where we have a strong Protex business, we will introduce Protex Complete 12 ourselves, which provide 12 times more germ protection and offers long-lasting anti-germ action. And finally, Hill's; we're pleased with Hill's strong organic sales performance in the quarter. The business is on track and innovation is driving both the domestic and international business. Our unique weight-loss product, Prescription Diet Metabolic Canine and Feline food is gaining share globally. We recently introduced a stew product along with the dry, and that has accelerated growth in the wet segment. The product comes in a new global packaging design and has been supported with a global testimonial campaign as well as print and online media. Adding to this successful innovation in April of this year was Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus Mobility Canine food and Metabolic Plus Urinary Feline food. These new foods, which are nutritionally formulated for concurrent health conditions, have been the primary focus of our 2015 pet conferences. Another global success in the Prescription Diet line has been upgrade of our k/d formula for kidney care diet in cats. Cats with renal conditions typically suffer a loss of appetite, so it's difficult to get them to eat the food, which will help them improve their conditions. This product contains our new EAT Technology Enhanced Appetite Trigger, which improves appetite while helping to both preserve lean muscle mass and increase energy. The feedback from vets has been excellent, and we've received excellent testimonials from clients and the veterinary healthcare teams. As you expect, we have more innovation planned for the balance of the year. To keep the momentum in our Prescription Diet business, in the third quarter in the U.S., we're beginning to roll out a Prescription Diet i/d sensitive, the first product in the GI segment for food sensitivity, free of wheat, gluten, lactose, and soy proteins. A trial program and pet parent guide helps veterinarians and pet parents to see the difference this food makes. These are part of the complete IMC bundle, with trade ads, printed and e-detailers, as well as in clinic seminars. A new products in our Science Diet line is Urinary Hairball Control Feline food, the only wellness food that addresses the two most common conditions in healthy cats. The launch this month in the U.S. is supported to the PetSmart store associate feeding program as well as from Petco's whole pet specialists. So in summary, we are pleased with the way 2015 is progressing, particularly in light of the macroeconomic challenges that we and other space around the world. We're committed to investing in the business in order to drive solid organic sales growth and global market shares. We will continue to focus on brand building innovation as well as our worldwide productivity programs. Colgate people around the world are implementing our effective strategies, which we expect will allow us to continue to deliver solid results, and we look forward to sharing these results as we go through the balance of the year. And now, Jessica, that's the end of my prepared remarks. I'd like to turn it over to questions. Operator : Thank you. Today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically for the telephone audience. We ask as well that you limit yourself to one question in return that to the queue to allow everyone the opportunity to ask their questions. We'll now go to Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for the question. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Jason. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Bina, you kind of closed at your prepared remarks talking about continue to focus on driving solid sales growth in market shares and certainly as you ran through the market shares performance, it's indeed impressive. But looking through the belly of the P&L and particularly gross profit, the leakage of cost inflation, which I know includes FX, and I suspect it's predominantly FX-related remains sizable. How do you wrestle with the balance of getting more price to cover some of that, even if it comes at the expense of some near-term market share versus continue to drive the market share? And do you think you're at the right balance right now? Or should you be leaning a little more towards price? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thanks for the question, Jason. We didn't rehearse this, but it's a perfect lead-in to some remarks I was wanting to make to put the gross profit in context, tell you to exactly your question, how we are thinking about that balance over the rest of the year and then probably I'll just go through the gross margin roll forward to save time, somebody else asking the question. I think to begin with, it goes without saying that 2015 is a volatile year, and characterized as we all know by economic challenges in many parts of the world, and I think very specifically as Bina mentioned, a continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which accelerated across the second quarter; and in fact has continued to strengthen with the current rates, we're seeing into the third quarter. And so, as you put it, we are very well pleased with the continued strong; in fact, accelerating organic growth in our business and we see that overall having a healthy balance between volume and pricing, which is a balance one tries to maintain. Indeed, as we look across each of our four business categories, we see a healthy balance between volume and price. And I would say at this stage that we are still expecting top line organic growth for the full-year to be in the 4% to 7% range. Now, when you step back from that and say what is making that work, we think it's three things; our innovation is clearly working, and it is broad and it is lined up well for the future. We believe, as we have said before that our commercial programs, which is a combination of traditional advertising and trade spending are effective and that together the strength of our innovation and the effectiveness of those commercial programs are seeing market shares growing quite broadly. So, in sum, our strategy is delivering strong brand led growth and double-digit EPS increases on a currency neutral basis. Now, as you rightly say, our gross margin in the quarter was pressured more than expected, despite the fact that we realized good pricing, that as you will see when I go through the gross margin roll forward we had good continued delivery of strong Funding the Growth and restructuring savings. Indeed, we offset year-to-date to the dollar impact of the cost increases so far this year. But in the second quarter specifically, we face three unanticipated negative impacts on our material costs. Obviously, we expected a meaningful impact from foreign exchange transaction costs, but we did incur the incremental costs of the faster than forecast foreign exchange deterioration. We saw in several high inflation emerging markets, including Venezuela, an increase in local material costs in the quarter. And finally, while not a significant factor in the overall gross margin decline, we did see additional material cost increases in Venezuela due to a slowdown in dollars received at the official rate. Now, what to do over the balance of the year? As you would expect, our planned response is additional pricing; and as I said on the last call, as we think about pricing we try and maintain this balance between volume and price. In some situations, Africa, Eurasia, as Bina mentioned, where the exchange impact is so significant, we take extremely aggressive action and, indeed, concede volume to get price and stabilize the business. In other parts of the world, we seek to maintain a balance, but regardless of approach, additional pricing is planned for the balance of the year. Clearly, we will redouble our focus on Funding the Growth, and we intend to take full advantage of generally weakening commodity materials pricing, which on the last call we said would really begin to benefit towards the end of the second quarter. So, those are our three responses. We believe we have planned them in a way that will allow us the maintenance of the top line growth in that 4% to 7% range. And now, our thinking for the year, we'll see a sequential improvement in gross margin across the balance of the year; and for the full-year, an increase of 10 basis points to 30 basis points. So, let me go from that to the gross profit roll forward. So, if we take the second quarter, we start with the prior year at 58.8%, we pick up a one point benefit from pricing, we pick up 2.2 points of favorable from Funding the Growth and the modest contribution from restructuring. We take a negative impact of 3.5 points of material prices, which traced back to the unexpected impacts I just referenced, 20 basis points of other, which gets you to the 58.3% in the quarter, the 50 basis points decline. So, that's how we're thinking about it. And as you rightly say, one is trying always to find a good balance between the top line growth and the recovery of the ratio in gross margin. And we think we have that in the plan for the balance of the year. Thanks for the question. Operator : We'll now go to Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. A question on Venezuela, actually, Ian, following up on some of things you just mentioned. Clearly it's a topic that comes up every time you visit with us in one form or another. You obviously continue to account for CP Venezuela at the SICAD rate. Many others have either shifted to SIMADI or else chosen to deconsolidate, as we saw from P&G this morning. So I know there are legal and accounting guidelines that dictate the appropriate treatment of Venezuela, but I'm wondering how much discretion there is on those matters because, at some level, it feels like kind of taking the hit, so to speak, and moving on would provide some benefit, especially if your access to dollars is decelerating, as you mentioned in response to Jason's question. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I wasn't necessarily expecting it as the second question, but I think we were expecting a remark or two on Venezuela. I think the first thing I would say in terms of the breadth of information that we provide on Venezuela, we have I think over time been providing increasing disclosure in our Qs and Ks. And I think you will find that continues to be the case when you read the Q on this quarter. As may know or you will now know, for the first six months of this year, Venezuela represented about 4% of our revenue and 2% of base business operating profit for the six months ended in June. And we do provide in the Q the detail of the net monetary assets that we hold of just over $600 million and the non-monetary assets that we hold of just under $300 million that could be subject to impairment. We also provide information as to the effect on that if we had to go to the SIMADI rate, which would see us with a charge of about $340 million after-tax or $0.37 per diluted share. And that would also likely lead to an impairment of our non-monetary assets. And we also provide, as we have done for some time, Colgate's total investment in Venezuela, which is about $1 billion. Now, the reason we continue to manage Venezuela the way we do, first of all, we have for 2014 and into 2015 been receiving dollars and are able to operate our business even though, as you say, that has become a little bit more volatile in the second quarter. Second, each company has its own facts and circumstances. And we still understand that our dividends would be remitted at the SICAD rate and, therefore, that's why we translate the business at that. And of course, we moved to the SICAD away from the official rate, so it is a little bit more conservative. But as you rightly indicate, Venezuela is a period-to-period assessment. You will see in our Q that our conclusion at the end of the second quarter is that we will maintain the translation rate we have and that we will continue to consolidate that business and we will specific to our facts and circumstances, as we always do, to continue to revisit that quarter-upon-quarter. Operator : And we'll now take a question from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, Bina and Ian. Good morning. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : How easily they forget. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can you just talk about structurally how you view advertising? Because it seems like your market shares aren't impacted at all by the pullback, and maybe it's like a share of voice issue because maybe the guys are pulling back as well. But maybe structurally could that advertising ratio be lower going forward because it's not having much of an impact on your market share trends? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I'll resist repeating the last man standing comment, Bill. But in terms of advertising, as I have said before, we build our programs from the ground up, and we're very much focused on what it takes to maintain awareness of our base business, build awareness of new innovations and build trial and go on and repeat, given the quality of our products for the new products that we bring to the marketplace. As you rightly say or suggest, and we have seen and we talked about it on the last call, we have seen many competitors in several significant markets around the world substantially pull back on traditional advertising and, therefore, we can accomplish our strategic objectives and not lose competitive presence on the ground. And as we've tried to express before, a lot of what you can do at the retail level today is far more sophisticated and strategic than maybe 10 years ago. And we make no apology for choosing to construct our marketing programs with good reliance on both. We talk about integrated marketing communications and we talk about reaching consumers at all touch points, which of course does, yes, include traditional television and digital, but also includes the retail, dental professional, veterinary professional environments that shape their purchasing decisions. I would not project seeing our advertising levels decline meaningfully. In fact, as we think about this year, we expect to be up on a local currency basis and probably at about the same level as last year on a ratio basis. But we'll obviously again as we go forward look at what it takes to build the engagement without consumers to keep growing market share and therefore our brands and therefore the top line of the company. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And then, can I just ask you, are you shipping to consumption now in most of the markets? So, is it stocking largely done? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you for the one question. The... William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: It's a short one. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : In China, as we said on the last call, in fact, the consumption was mid-single-digits. We suggested, I think, that the second quarter was off to a good start in China and that we expected to be back to consumption. You, I think, can see that in the Asia numbers. China is back to consumption, and as Bina mentioned, we saw a bounce back in Brazil, and when we look at our categories in Latin America, including Brazil, the growth rates of the categories is around that mid-single-digits level; so we would say, you know, that's the expected environment going forward. In fact, to comment for the emerging markets, mid-single-digits for the U.S., about 2% on average or the spread is 1% to 3% depending on the categories; and Europe at the same, 0% to 2% range bound level it's been in for some time. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll now take a question from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Chris. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Ian, I guess that's a perfect transition to Brazil. The last time we were talking about Brazil intra-quarter and in last quarter's call, you weren't particularly optimistic about it. The recovery there, though, your volumes, your organic was up nicely. I guess can you talk about what's changed? Has it been the category growth rates or is it \u2013 it doesn't look like it was an acceleration of share based on what you said, but I'd just love any commentary you can offer up there? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Our share is up. I mean, Bina talked about the year-to-date. The latest period is over 72%, as I said last time, who's looking? I think, fundamentally, Chris, it has to do with the category. I think we were prudent the last time we spoke, because the country was in a state of short-term dislocations; and in fact I had just come back from Brazil and so felt it up close and personal, and we thought it was better to take a more prudent stance for the balance of the year, until we saw the category growth rates come through. I would say that has now stabilized. We expected to provide an update at the end of the second quarter, and we're able to do so, and I think we can say that the underlying consumer consumption now in our categories in Brazil is back to that broad mid-single-digits growth rates. So, it traces specifically to the category growth. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : And we'll now go to Bill Chappell with SunTrust. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Bill. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey. Just going back to Latin America, just wanted to \u2013 and maybe I can't do the algebra; but on unit growth, it looks like it was flat excluding, I guess, the acquisitions year-over-year, and it said it was partially hurt by Venezuela. I mean, would it have been up meaningfully without Venezuela? And do you expect unit growth to kind of start to bounce back as we move through the year? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, again, I think we were very pleased with the organic growth, to save Ali the trouble when he comes on, we don't break out Venezuela; but our volume growth in Latin America, we see as coming back, but we were quite happy with the trade-off we made to price relative to volume in this quarter to an earlier question. The volume ex-Venezuela was indeed more positive than you see for the division, but by a multiple. Did we lose everybody? Operator : No, your line is still open. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Do we have no more questions? Operator : I guess, Mr. Chappell, your line is still open. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that was \u2013 yeah. So, it was just to clarify, you do expect unit growth. It's just a matter \u2013 and Venezuela did kind of wipe away all of the unit growth this quarter? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Venezuela depressed the division's unit growth, yes. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And but even with incremental price increases, unit growth should bounce back going forward? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you. Operator : We'll now go to Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you so much. Good morning. I'm just wondering... Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Caroline. Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Could you dig in a little bit on Russia, where P&G had really, really awful June results, I believe, I think down 57%, just very difficult times? And also comment generally on whether some of your foreign competitors are behaving differently, given they don't have the dollar currency issues you have? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I really don't want to start getting into detail by countries; but suffice it to say, we did not have the declines in Russia that some others are quoting. Our market shares in Russia are strong and growing. And we, of course, have taken some fairly significant pricing across that division, but very specifically to Russia, given the foreign exchange impact, actually, our toothbrush here in Russia was up two points. So, is back to the opening remarks, really, and that is, yes, we are taking pricing as we need to. We're focusing on Funding the Growth, we're focusing on the Global Growth and Efficiency program, but we're also focusing on building our brands and building our market shares. And I would say the progress in Russia fits that model. Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : And just on foreign competitors, are you seeing them, you know, enter any markets anew or do anything differently, the ones you don't have a dollar exposure? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think most everybody is hurt a little bit by the Russian circumstance. We certainly don't see any irrational behavior the other way, no. Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Sorry. I didn't mean specific to Russia. I mean, in general. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Oh. You know, again, you see pockets of increased activity. You see pockets of decreased activity. I would characterize the global landscape as business as usual. Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Ali, Ali, Ali, don't shout at me. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Why? Do I shout? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, no, no. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: You're listening to our previous call? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I was reading the transcript. Yeah. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I just state the truth. That's all I try to do. So, on advertising spend, you know, it's the fifth quarter in a row where we've seen it down. What we see, at least, understand the gross to net, but what we see in particular is down in Latin America and Africa/Eurasia, and I can't pretend to say that if you decline, you know, reduce advertising spend in those regions you'll get an immediate response, but you did see flat volume in Latin America understanding on the price/mix that you got or the price parts you got. Africa/Eurasia was down 3%, which is some of the worst we've seen. And I get the share of voice comments. Our share voice isn't lower. It's actually higher and that's why we're gaining share. As your senior brethren are feeling quite some pain as well. But what's happened to the category? So, what's the category responsibility? I mean, maybe share voices isn't the right metric, because the category itself should be, could be growing a little bit faster going forward. So, I wanted to get your thoughts on that a little bit. And I know it's only one question, but as a clarification on the gross margin that you described earlier on, if you would, please? So, the gross margin guidance is down to like 80 basis points at the high end, but you're still to kind of negative low single-digit EPS growth number? I'm trying to get a better understanding what the offsets are just staying in that low single-digits or is it just kind of worst low single-digits, when you describe it for the year? Thanks very much. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the first question is a very broad question. To be clear, I'm not saying that our share of voice is necessarily higher by market. I'm saying that if you use that as the measure of consumer engagement, which is a questionable hypothesis, even though, it gives you a number, we have remained competitive. And back to the comment we made earlier, you know, our objective is to make sure we have brand awareness of our base business and build trials for new businesses. And we believe the spend levels we have do that. If you look at the category rates of growth, I would argue that growing categories is a lot more complicated than simply media pressure. Obviously, in our advertising we do the educational work, but sometimes perhaps we don't talk about it enough or people don't focus on it enough, but how you go to market, the depth of distribution you build, the sizing pricing you have in your portfolio, indeed, the price points you have in your portfolio amplified by price both at the low-end and the high-end creates access points for people to come into and stay in a category. And we put an awful lot of pressure and effort to making sure we construct our portfolio the right way in order to keep the category penetration up and keep the growth rates of the categories at healthy levels. And all of that you see in the portfolio choices we make, the sizing pricing choices we make, the distribution gains we get, right down to the furthest rural areas, and that is very much a driver on sustaining a category growth. Now, it's a very big discussion, Ali, and I'm not trying to trivialize it. I'm just trying to suggest there are more factors that come to bear than just advertising. And then to come to your second point. And some of you have already started to indicate this, so let me try and respond to the question and be clear. As we said in our release, at current spot rates, we continue to expect a low-single digit earnings per share decline on a dollar basis, excluding, of course, the restructuring and the other charges we highlighted in the release. Now to be clear, low-single digit earnings decline range, dollar earnings decline range, is minus 1% to minus 3%. And in as much as we have seen continued significant deterioration in foreign exchange rates over the course of the second quarter and since we last spoke, we would expect to be at the more negative end of that range, which would still reflect a double-digit increase on a currency neutral basis. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks for being clear. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take John Faucher with JPMorgan. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Ian, if you look at the gross margin reconciliation that you did, obviously a huge hit on the raw material standpoint. You talked about raw materials sort of beginning to trend more favorably in June, I think you said in your commentary. So, as we look at the transactional piece of that versus the general, let's say, dollar-based raw material inflation, how should we see those things changing as we look out over the next six months to 12 months and that starts to flow in? So, I guess can you give us some direction in terms of how much of that transactional piece you'll be able to offset just with the more favorable moves in the underlying raw material rates? Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think depending on your view on foreign exchange, we've just given you our view on foreign exchange, that unfortunately is likely to continue. So the benefit will come in the material costs, the commodity costs, over the balance of the year and the increased pricing that we will be taking. So if I give a general view, that's really the way it breaks down. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. So, I guess I was looking for a little bit more of a directional view in terms of excluding the FX, excluding the productivity, just how big can the swing in the raw material benefit be, even if it's just directional over the next several quarters? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, that was the detail I didn't want to and still don't want to give. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll now go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. First just following up on John's question. The gross margin outlook, while down from prior expectations implies a very big acceleration in the second half. And you mentioned plans for more pricing, so that's part of it. But can you talk through some of the other key drivers like Funding the Growth and some of the cost savings programs that will help drive that meaningful improvement in the back half margins? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Olivia, clearly it really is a combination of the factors that I raised before, which is more pricing, more Funding the Growth, more favorable underlying commodity pricing and maybe a little bit of Global Growth and Efficiency as well. And then you've maybe got the mix aspect of our business that could provide a factor as well. But the real drivers will be pricing, will be Funding the Growth, underlying commodity costs and maybe a touch from Global Growth and Efficiency, as we have seen before. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. And then on North America, why does there seem to be more volatility on pricing in North American than all your other regions? Because results last quarter and then it reversed to be down this quarter. So, what's driving that difference? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, the biggest single difference, Olivia, is couponing. Couponing is a very effective draw mechanism in the U.S., used more in the U.S. than any other geography around the world, and of course, goes into trade spending. Bina mentioned some of the new products that we have been introducing, and we have obviously been trying to build trial of those new products and, therefore, you invest in couponing and you see it in the volume growth of the business. So you're always going to see North America is a little bit more lumpy quarter-on-quarter because of that difference in the go-to-market. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Mark. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I wanted to ask, as you go around the world, which geographies are you seeing the most impact from local or regional competition? And how do you think about changes in go-to-market strategy to compensate, if any? And thoughts or current updates on a different way of actually going to market? How are you embracing internet, where applicable, and so forth? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I would say local competitors are a factor around the world. I guess they've been often discussed by several folk in China. Certainly, we see them in Latin America. And your best way of responding and the way we try to respond is to understand the consumer and make sure that the innovation we're providing is competitive against the benefit or the product offering the local competitor is providing. And then secondly when you mention go-to-market, it is often the case with the local competitor that they have a particular infrastructure that can build downtrade distribution and a lot of activity, again, at retail level, and you just need to be effective in making sure that your products are available at an equal weight to that competitor and that you have the same degree of activity at retail level to compete with them. Now, China is an interesting example where our market share over the last several years has gone up from 29% to 34%. One of our principal competitors has come down from 25% to under 14%. And another has come down from 12% to high-single digit and the local competitor has really taken the difference. So without making one example a predictor for the world, I think it demonstrates we have managed to defend and continue to grow our business quite well. But, it comes down to product offering, and the strength of your go-to-market, particularly down trade and particularly activity at retail. Operator : We'll now go to Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning, everyone, Ian, Bina. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Javier. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : A quick question with regards to Hill's. Very good number, the 7%. It seems like the growth at least in your 10-Q, you say that the Prescription Diet category, more like the veterinary side of the business, it was the most meaningful contribution. I had expected because last year we had this problem at the PetSmart specialty stores kind of outlets that it would be the other way around. So, if you can explain the dynamics of the pet food market with the entry of this Blue Buffalo as a publicly traded company, are they promoting more how \u2013 what is happening in the specialty stores? And how sustainable this growth is in the veterinarian channel? Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I guess, the simple answer is they both grew. And the reason for the growth was driven by innovation, both on the Prescription Diet line and the Science Diet line. The appearance of Blue Buffalo in the pet super stores is not a new thing. They have been there for a long while. And our presence in those stores, our activities in those stores has not been affected. So, we saw very good growth, and as we have tried to say several times on calls, one of the big differences we were striving for was a stream of innovation on Hill's, so that it was not episodic, but that we had a flow of innovation both on the Science Diet business and the Prescription Diet business, and we think we have that. I mean, who couldn't love innovation that has Enhanced Appetite Trigger built into it? I bet the Petco for that. So, it's driven by innovation. Now where Blue Buffalo will be new is in the more therapeutic side of the business. They have announced two entries in only two segments. One is gastrointestinal. You'll remember from Bina's remarks that we are going to market with a very compelling gastrointestinal product right now with the Prescription Diet line, so I come back to the innovation. We think it's strong, and we think it will see us well with our very elevated share with the vets, which as you rightly say, continue to grow in the second quarter. So, we think we're well-positioned with both, Javier. Operator : We'll now take a question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Lauren. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hello. I was just, a couple of things. One is on \u2013 I know it's very clear mathematically that the SG&A have to be sort of the plug with the lower gross margin outlook, but I was wondering if that is really sourced from the restructuring savings, if it's an acceleration, what you're tapping into to kind of be able to offset some of the gross margin impact. And then the second thing was, is it reasonable to assume that some of the gross margin impact, it's just the timing issue like the pricing that will be coming through to the balance of the year, as you get into 2016 will kind of make up some of this incremental pressure you're seeing on commodities because of FX? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Could you repeat the second question, Lauren? Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Sorry. I realized as I was talking I was getting really unclear. So, the transactional impact on commodity costs, which I think is sort of what you were saying in Venezuela, is the timing of the pricing the issue? That it's not that you're not going to price to recover this incremental pressure, it's just we can't get it in fast enough to cover the impact this year, but as you go into next year, it starts to catch up? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I mean, correct. We've always had this situation. I tried to say earlier in response to a question, in some cases, Russia would be a classic example where a crisis emerges. You take very aggressive pricing and accept the fallout on the volume just to stabilize the business. In other cases, you simply can't take pricing quickly enough, and intelligently manage the balance between volume price and therefore the top line growth in response to transaction, which hits you the minute you exchange slides. So, our pricing benefit from that will be progressive over the balance of the year, and you are correct, will continue into 2016. So, as we look at the balance of the year, yes, it is to do with the Global Growth and Efficiency program; and as I said, advertising will be broadly in line with last year. You may recall the last time we spoke from a ratio point of view, you may recall the last time we talked about it being up. So, heavily led by Global Growth and Efficiency, and I think you could say a moderation, again, we still think by our share and our top line delivery competitive for the moderation and the advertising over the back half. Operator : And we'll now take Iain Simpson from SocGen. Go ahead. Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker): Thank you very much. We've seen increased commodity, volatility and also increased currency volatility of late. And you've sort of talked about how your attitudes took pricing and trade spend change in response to that. Have you seen anything unusual from any of your global competitors and how they prioritize the balance of their spending? Is the landscape moving more towards trade spend or advertising? Or if you could just give us some color on the dynamics there? Thank you very much. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Well, first of all, it's a great name. But in response to the question, as we answered the previous question, I would say from a global point of view, no, you know, no substantial difference. I mean, if you go country-by-country around the world, you see different approaches from different competitors that you have to react to, but no overarching strategy that sees a significant change, no. Operator : And that was our final question. I would like to turn the conference back to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. Thank you very much, Jessica. Thank you all who joined the call and your interest in the company, and as we always say at this time, thank you especially to the Colgate people who make it all happen. Bye-bye. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Now for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Bina Thompson. Please go ahead, Bina. Bina Thompson : Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our third quarter 2015 earnings release conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, President, Chairman and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. We're pleased with the continued solid organic sales growth, of course negative foreign exchange continues to be a major challenge, but as you\u2019ll hear our market shares are strong and growing, one of the best indications of the health of the business. Happily gross profit margin increase in the quarter as a result of our funding the growth initiatives, pricing actions and our global growth and efficiency program. Worldwide our overhead cost are down on a dollar basis. Now while we reported advertising was down on dollar basis, we think we\u2019re getting good results from the dollars we spend both in-store and out. Digital advertising is growing in fact as an example in Latin America we are increasing our investment in digital to better reach our younger audiences as well as to drive engagements. And as we focused on developing strategic collaborations with partners such as Google and Facebook, we\u2019re better able to measure the results of our investments. Marketing mix model studies from several countries across Latin America show an ROI for digital investment that is three to four times higher than TV confirming this shift is right to drive our business. Our balance sheet remain solid and we\u2019re making very good progress on working capital. So let's get right into the divisions starting with North America. Innovation continues to a fuel our success in North America. As mentioned in the press release, our market shares are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, liquid hand soap, body wash and fabric conditioners. And this was true on a quarter-over-quarter comparison as well. At the same time, we\u2019ve seen a decline in private label shares in many of our categories indicating the consumers preference for branded products and respect of our equities. In the toothpaste category, the launch of Colgate Total Daily Repair supported by engaging media campaign and strong in-store shopper materials has added incremental share to the base line products. In the whitening segment, we offer a full range of products toothpaste, toothbrushes and mouthwash. Our Colgate Optic White toothpaste has grown share from 2.4% in the third quarter of 2011 to a 5.7% share in the most recent quarter. Colgate Enamel Health has also seen good growth momentum increasing a full share point quarter-over-quarter. Another exciting opportunity is a sensitivity segment where we are a strong number two player. That segment has seen a compound growth of 7.7% over the last four years versus 2.8% for toothpaste overall. In the mouthwash category, where our share is up year-to-date 20 basis points, both Colgate Total for gum health and Colgate Enamel Health mouthwash are picking up momentum. Our Colgate Total for gum health is the number one new item in the leading retailer and receiving full support in-store. In liquid hand soaps, our year-to-date share is up almost a full point to a leading 30.6% while private label products have declined almost two full points year-to-date to the lowest level in at least five years. Premium offerings such as soap Softsoap Fragrant Foaming Collection and D\u00e9cor Collection foaming hand soap offer distinctive benefits. Similar Softsoap Fresh & Glow body wash with real extract with a unique formula giving you healthy looking skin that glows launched earlier this year has increased our share in that category but almost a full point year-to-date. Fabric conditioner also continue to perform well. Suavitel Fragrance Pearls in-wash scent boosters which provide five times longer lasting fragrance versus detergent alone which we told you about last quarter have helped increase our national share almost a full point year-to-date now approaching 20% of the market. More trial focus programs are expected to drive further growth in the fourth quarter. Now as you\u2019d expect our new product grid is well populated and we will share with you some more exciting innovation slated for early 2016 on future calls. Turning then to Europe, South Pacific. Our business there is showing encouraging signs of recovery with innovation playing a critical role. Our market shares are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, body wash, shower gels, underarm protection and fabric conditioners. In toothpaste we\u2019re very excited about the early success of our launch of Colgate Max Light Expert White toothpaste, latest premium offering in this fast growing segment. Launched in the UK in June, it achieved 2.7% share in August and was named the best new toiletries launched for 2015 by one of our larger drug retailers. Two products under the Elmex brand developed specifically for the pharmacy channel, Elmex Sensitive Professional and Elmex ANTI-CARIES PROFESSIONAL has driven our pharmacy share in France to a leadership position 26.3% year-to-date and now ahead of the nearest competitor by 150 basis points. In manual toothbrushes, our leading market share in Europe is up 130 basis points year-to-date to 24.6% with our nearest competitor down to 17.4%. Driving these excellent results has been the launch across the region of our Colgate 360\u00b0 manual toothbrush line, priced at a super-premium tier these brushes deliver superior cleaning for whole mouth clean and has been supported by a full shopper program. We\u2019re also very encouraged by our launch of Sanex advanced range of body washes, underarm protection and body and hand lotion. This innovation brings dermatological expertise for skin specific needs to a third growth pillar for Sanex leading the brand towards a more professional approach in mass. Early results are excellent. Since launch Sanex is the fastest growing brand in both body washes and underarm and in our top markets of France, Spain and the UK our market shares are up in both categories. In fabric conditioners our market shares are up 20 basis points year-to-date to 24% across the European region with the most recent read at 24.5%. Contributing to this success is Soupline Fruity Sensations with a striking look and feel and new different and long lasting fragrances. More innovation is planned across our categories for the rest of this year and into 2016. Specifically in oral care, we will launching the Colgate Expert toothbrush and built in whitening pen. And as you know that product form has helped drive our manual toothbrush share to record high tier in the U.S. In toothpaste we will be launching Colgate Total Proof. This innovation uses breakthrough color change technology that turns the white paste into a blue foam while brushing, giving consumers the confidence of ultimate clean feeling. Turning then to Latin America. Business across the region is solid and as elsewhere innovation has driven market share increases. Our regional market shares are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, toilet soap, liquid soap, shampoo, hand dish and liquid cleaners. And even in the face of some economic uncertainties in countries such as Brazil, our categories still show solid local currency growth. Our regional toothpaste share is up two full points year-to-date to 78.2%. In Brazil our market share is up 50 basis points year-to-date to 72%, the highest share in over 20 years and in the face of continued heightened competitive activity. Colgate Total 12 re-launched in August with the positioning of protects a 100% of the services of the mouth. Now has an 18.5% share in the most recent period. In Mexico our share is up 1 point year-to-date to 81.3% with the most recent read at 81.6%, while our major competitor shows continued share decline. Contributing to this success is our premium priced Colgate Luminous White Advanced, Colgate\u2019s most advanced whitening toothpaste formulated to intensify the whiteness of your teeth by three shades. In manual toothbrushes our market share is up 230 basis points year-to-date to 45.4% with the most recent read at 49.8%. In Mexico we recently reintroduced our Colgate 360\u00b0 line with a new packaging structure with premium finishing and improved benefit communications, all mouth clean with a 151% more bad breadth bacteria removal. As a result the Colgate 360\u00b0 equity is up 110 basis points year-to-date reaching a record 11.1% share. Our leading year-to-date bar soap share is at 30.8% with the most recent read at 32%. Record high shares were achieved in Mexico, Columbia and Guatemala and our two equities Protex and Palmolive continue to hold the number one and two position across the regions. In Mexico where we have a strong Home Care business our result to excellent across the three sub categories hand dish, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners. Our market-shares are up on year-to-date basis 230, 40 and 150 basis points respectively to 52.6%, 33.5% and 48.4%. So looking ahead to further boost our leading manual toothbrush share, we are now in the process of launching Colgate Slim Soft White with 17 times slimmer tip spiraled bristles which provide both whitening and deep, yet gentle cleaning. And innovation launching in fabric conditioners is Suavitel Goodbye Rinse, the market leading Suavitel with an improved no rinse formula. And as you would expect more innovation is planned for 2016 to continue the momentum in this region. Turning then to Asia, we\u2019re pleased with the strength of the business particularly in our two largest markets China and India which both delivered good volume growth, category growth rates remain mid-single digit in China while in India our categories are growing as well. In India, our year-to-date toothpaste share is at almost 55% on a national basis and close to 59% in rural market. Our market leading manual toothbrush share is 43.6% year-to-date and our launch of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Enamel repair toothpaste while in its early days is doing well. Our Colgate 360\u00b0 Charcoal Gold toothbrush launched earlier in other Asian markets is no contributing to the results in India. This successful innovation with anti-bacterial bristles provides a whole mouth clean and have achieved strong shares across the region in the most recent period, 1.4% in Hong Kong; 2.5% in the Philippines; 1.3% in Taiwan and almost a 1% in Malaysia and has been incremental in each market. More innovation is slated for this quarter and beyond. In China we will be launching two new products developed to appeal to local consumer preferences, Colgate Power White Lemon Salt toothpaste for freshness and whitening experience with a lemon and sea salt flavor and Colgate 360\u00b0 Gold ginseng gum care toothpaste which contains ginseng essence and enhances the gums power of defense. Two popular Colgate Total variance Charcola Deep Clean and Pro Gum will now be available in a gel format in addition to the paste. And in Thailand in the personal care category, we\u2019re launching products for both men and women. For men, Protex Men 3-in-1 an all-in-one body cleansing solution with anti-bacterial protection and for women Protex Intimate with anti-bacterial protection for long lasting freshness and well-being sensation every day. Africa, Eurasia, as you know several of our larger markets in Africa Eurasia region have been facing major currency headwinds. Despite the pricing actions we have taken to combat the currency headwinds, organic sales growth is holding at mid-single digit. Market shares are increasing and successful innovation is fueling our growth. Our regional toothpaste share is up at full point year-to-date to almost 33%. In Russia, our share is up 230 basis points year-to-date to 34.2% hitting a record share of 35.1% in the most recent period. We recently launched Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer which has already reached at 0.7% share year-to-date and contributed to the share gain. In South Africa, our share grew 150 basis points year-to-date to 50.2% driven by a new marketing campaign behind Colgate Total. In toothbrushes our share declined in only one country and was up in the majority of our market. In Russia where we achieved incremental listings in Russia\u2019s number one retailer, our toothbrush share grew 270 basis points year-to-date to 48.1% with the most recent read at 49.4%. And in Turkey our share grew 10 basis points year-to-date to 28.6% with the most recent read at 29.7% and in South Africa our share was up 30 basis points year-to-date to 38.2% with the most recent read at 38.6%. Our bar soap business continued with strong momentum in our two biggest markets Russia and South Africa, the recent introduction of Protex Men Power contributed to a regional share gain of 150 basis points year-to-date to almost 24%. More innovation is slated for this quarter. Across the region we will be relaunching our base Colgate Sensitive toothpaste and our line of Plax mouthwash. In the personal care category, we will launching a body wash occupying the new energizing segment for men\u2019s body wash Palmolive Men Citrus Crush. It invite the consumer to experience an intense invigorating shower with [indiscernible] and grape fruit ingredients sourced from the purest substances of nature and this buzzing citrus fragrance to spoil the senses. And Hill\u2019s, Hill\u2019s delivered another solid quarter of organic sales growth with a good balance of volume and price. Here in the U.S. superstore retail consumption showed a good increase, innovation across Hill\u2019s prescription diet and Hill\u2019s science diet as well as volume growth in our ideal balanced brand contributed to our good results. Our Prescription Diet Metabolic Canine and Feline food continue to gain share around the world. Our new stews form has accelerated our growth in the wet segment. We continue to receive endorsements from key thought leaders and the global rollout this year of Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus breakthrough dual efficacy food with nutrition and clinically proven to address obesity and concurrent conditions has added to the momentum of the business. It\u2019s now selling in 38 countries and has benefited from extensive sampling to drive awareness and trial. Our ongoing global integrated marketing campaign includes professional print online media, in clinic seminars and recommendation tools and testimonial videos to showcase efficacy. In our wellness business one of our newer launches Science Diet Urinary Hairball Control is meeting with excellent results. The only wellness food that addressed the two most common conditions in health cats it was among the top three wet variants in the U.S. marketing during the first three months after its launch and had a very high star rating on Amazon.com. It\u2019s been the product focus for our new professional consultants at PetSmart and Petco and has received good in store activation feedback. Building on our success in the U.S. it is just been launched in Europe. And as we look into 2016 there is more exciting innovation news which we will discuss with you on future calls. So in summary we\u2019re pleased with the continued solid organic sales growth and market share gains around the world. Our innovation pipeline is as full as ever and our savings programs are on track. Colgate people around the world continue to focus on our four strategic initiatives delivering consistent results. So we look forward to sharing our results with you as we finish the year. And now Kelly I should like to turn it over for questions. Operator : Thank you. Today\u2019s question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically for the cell phone audience [Operator Instructions]. And we\u2019ll take our first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So first Ian just a detail question, I think last quarter you\u2019d indicated in local currency advertising will be roughly flat year-over-year as a percent of sales in 2015. Is that still the case? How you think about that line item? And then the real question on that front is, it\u2019s now been six quarters in a row where A&P has been down substantially as a percent of sales. I know you\u2019ve indicated before it\u2019s been funneled back into promotion which has been a fact given the market share performance. But the level of pull back in A&P is really striking relative to your -- traditionally the way you\u2019ve run the business. So what gives you confidence this won\u2019t come back to bite you in the long run in terms of lower demand going forward particularly given the macro situation out there right now? Ian Cook : As you might imagine not an unexpected question, and in answering it as you did let\u2019s take a little bit broader perspective and then come back to your specific question. So the world we\u2019re dealing in today in terms of our categories so I am talking Colgate businesses now and the categories in which we do business not the macroeconomic scene, we have a world where our categories are growing between 0% and 2% in the developed world in Europe at the low end of that and in the U.S. at the upper end of that 0% to 2% growth. In the emerging markets through this call the growth rates in our categories continue to be mid-single digits generally. And our objective, business objective, in that arena has been to have a sustainable rate of growth organically in that 4% to 7% range that we mentioned at the beginning of the year, which we think we continue into the third quarter and we continue to talk about 4 to 7 of the year and indeed as we think about 2016, we begin our budgeting process with the same ambition next year. And the way you get that consistent rate of growth is by building new brands. And you build your brands as measured in market share and as we choose investment vehicles to build those brands you\u2019re focusing on trial and repeat purchase of our new innovation and our existing businesses. And don\u2019t forget in many of these emerging markets consumer behavior is challenged by local category conditions in those markets, and in store engagement can be more persuasive than -- we were all educated as being proper advertising investment. So we balance and like to think we invest smartly in traditional media the traditional television magazine, radio, sampling devices that would be in that advertising number with an increasing shift as Bina pointed out to digital, being both lower cost and better rate of return and frankly in Latin America with the millennials are now the predominant parent generation a better way of engaging with that target group. And you as you indicated the in-store work that we do within these volatile times can be particularly powerful. Now all of that said as we think about going forward and we begin our process for the budget in 2016 even though we haven\u2019t yet fully begun that process, if we look at the array of innovation we have over the next three years starting in 2016, I think it would be safe to say that our expectation would be that our traditional advertising ratios would be up in 2016. Dara Mohsenian : Okay is that on a local currency basis so that\u2019s overall company and also can you give us a sense of where you kind of lead 2015 in terms of the ad ratio? Ian Cook : Well, the ad ratio will be according to our current plan for 2015, will be up quarter-on-quarter for the balance of the year and now I am talking income statement, so I am talking dollar. And if you think about 2016, I think at this stage the expectation would be dollar and of course therefore local currency given what I think most believe will be an improving or at least less bad foreign exchange environment. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. First of all Bina you talked about the Brazilian competitive environment as still being fairly intent. But can you talk a little bit more qualitatively is that more price based competition, is there more advertising, is there more innovation just fighting for shelf and space or just -- I know your shares are good, but directionally what are you seeing there? And then just separately housekeeping on Hills, can you remind us what the split is U.S. versus international sales now for health and maybe in the quarter. How sales performance differed by region? Thank you. Ian Cook : The Brazil, I don\u2019t actually recall Bina\u2019s language, but frankly the Brazilian environment hasn\u2019t become particularly more competitive and historically, it continues to be a competitive marketplace to be sure. But again back to my answer to Dara, with the programs we have and the innovation we have we see our market-share continuing to grow and at 72 as Bina said it's the highest in the last 20 years with our principal competitors both down. So frankly at this stage whatever the threats are in the marketplace, we seem to be meeting them. If we turn to your second question which was around Hill\u2019s, I think it would be fair to say in broad terms that Hill\u2019s is about 50-50 U.S. domestic, international business split. Wendy Nicholson : And it trends internationally versus in U.S. in terms of growth for Hills, similar? Ian Cook : Similar. Yes, I mean the innovation moves from the U.S. around the world and I am pleased to say things like metabolic and metabolic plus are having similar impacts where ever we take them, so yes. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline Levy : I am sorry I hopped a little late, but I am wondering if you address Venezuela and the decision not just sort of take it to worst case scenario in the earnings did I miss something there? Ian Cook : No you didn\u2019t Caroline and I am sure many of you have not yet had the chance to get to our [indiscernible] which was posted earlier this morning. But as you well know from the financial literature and the decisions that one makes in this space any decision that we would take to deconsolidated would be driven by our inability on an ongoing basis to get dollars or if we faced additional restrictions on our ability to make local operating decisions on the ground clearly these are things that we revisit quarter upon quarter and we duly did so for this quarter Caroline, but based on our facts and circumstances and the assessments we made we have chosen to keep reporting Venezuela this quarter and of course that is subject that we will revisit period-by-period as time goes on. Caroline Levy : And off the 12% pricing in Latin America then can you say how much is Venezuela? Ian Cook : Well remember the government approved pricing that got in Venezuela which I think was around 70% plus, 74% if I remember correct me, that was in the fourth quarter of last year. So obviously you have the rollover effect. There is pricing obviously we get for the non-regulated businesses but I would tell you that we are getting pricing across Latin America from Mexico down to Argentina. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : I wanted to ask again about why you are confident that you\u2019re striking the right balance in terms of volume versus margin for the long term? And so take maybe two metrics, one take as the move more and more to in store promotion, and in store displays, doesn\u2019t that suggest that the consumer is making more and more decision at the shelf and that\u2019s been a trend going on for a while. It seems like its accelerating. So does that reduce such a competitive advantage over the long term because I think it\u2019s tough to really differentiate yourself as much in store as one could through traditional media as an example? Perhaps online -- although I\u2019d say that the ROI there is still hefty because we know long term history. So, how you balance that? Is that -- are you setting yourself up in a tougher situation by pushing more in store for the long term given you\u2019re trying to differentiate your brand? Ian Cook : Very good and deep question Ali, as usual. The answer is it\u2019s not either-or and I think if you were to go back to again the days when many of us made our marketing bones, in store activity was pretty rudimentary there was a cardboard display stuck at the end of the shelf with a $0.99 off flag on it hardly brand building in nature and that is why everybody has this aversion if you will to in store investment versus the supposed quality of the engagement we get from their traditional media understanding that that will today is so fragmented that it is less precise than perhaps many of us believed historically. So, no, obviously, you don\u2019t find yourself in a place where all of your engagement with consumer happens at the retail level. So with the data available to us today with the techniques available to us today with some of the in store engagement materials available to us today, which are brand and benefit and therapy open bracket Colgate specific including some times the coloring of the shelves but house oral care products at retail that is a wonderful environment to get consumers to make that final decision particularly if they are in a stressed highly devalued geography. You still have the advertising and we can debate traditional versus digital, but is making the awareness connection and seeking to provoke the trial, but you miss everything if you don\u2019t engage with that consumer when they come to that store to make sure the trial engendered if the your product. So yes it is a balance so it is not a journey to everything at retail but I think the historical perceptions of what you can do at retail and frankly a prejudice that says what you do at retail is by definition not brand building I am afraid it\u2019s a little bit old school. Ali Dibadj : So besides that I am old school there here --. Ian Cook : That\u2019s allowed [ph] by the way. Ali Dibadj : But do you think -- so I understand engaging at shelf I mean you guys have seen it, you guys have done it very well the [indiscernible] side slightly all show. I struggle with that being not -- that being differentiated so feeling that that\u2019s probably easier to copy with a little bit of spend in store, with a little bit of more discussion with the merchants in store, then really good copy and whether that\u2019d be digital or not. And it just sounds like you don\u2019t even think that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s not as copy able in store? Ian Cook : Ali, again, take Latin America think about our market share and think about how much of that shelf we have, then think about red, then think about a program that may take a local dentist with an incentive to go to a store and buy Colgate that is hitting you in the face with a therapeutic health message so you\u2019re coming in provoked by the dentist and Colgate is engaging newer shelf, a competitor can spend more money, they\u2019re not going to get that presence at retail. So I would argue it is differentiating and the presence you have at retail with the market shares we have in our specific categories come back to the more fragmented media market, you can argue which is more likely to get the consumers\u2019 attention. Having said that I am still old school and I agree with you a good copy is very important part of a marketing mix, but it\u2019s a marketing mix I would argue it is not simply more of the store, but everything on media. Things are much more balanced. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz : Good morning. You said about doing something in organic, it's been a while since you guys have looked at acquisitions and it seems like the industry is clearly changing very rapidly, there is not as amount of active business twist, there is big focus on cost cutting and it seems like you're pretty deeply penetrated and especially in oral care. So is there anything out there that you guys are thinking about this juncture that would making better leverage from your distribution infrastructure? Ian Cook : Yes, I mean it's clearly a very good question Bill and obviously were I to answer and I\u2019d have to kill you. So I think the headline would be, I think we are very thoughtful and we\u2019re very strategic about acquisition, you have seen that I think in those things that we have acquired. We are all with strategically open to the right acquisition at the right time. As you know these things are little bit of process of serendipity however much you move and peruse and then we are also very disciplined on valuations. You have to live with what you buy for the betterment of the company over the long haul. So I think my answer would be we\u2019re as interested in acquisitions as were in Sanex and GABA and Tom\u2019s and the laser brand in Myanmar and if more were to become available and the price was right, you\u2019d see as this interested going forward as we have been over our recent past. But I wouldn\u2019t make it a tilting point now versus previously. Bill Schmitz : Okay, great. Can I just have a follow-up, I am asking to read the tea leaves here, but are there any signs that we\u2019re bottoming in emerging market, I know the category growth rates are still fairly healthy, but almost all that\u2019s driven by price and mix. If people get some of the scan volume data flat up very slightly most of that inflation pricing with the absence of a local competitor. So like do you have any thoughts on kind of when we really start to see consumption come back? Ian Cook : I think in terms of physical consumption; first of all some of these markets are growing in volume terms, so it's not everywhere. But you're right, when pricing is very aggressive needs as must from a dollar point of view that tends to depress volume in s short haul so without being glib, I think my answer would be once the necessary wave of pricing is behind us and everybody else that\u2019s taking pricing I think you can expect the balance between price and volume to move back more on to the volume side of the equation. When exactly that will be is difficult to tell I would certainly say it will be no earlier than next year. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Good morning. Thank you for question. I want to come back to the investment questions against the consumer. So a two part question; one it sounds like you really were in an environment where shifting more to trade makes sense given the sharper marketing components that ways and the engagement the consumer there and digital course playing a larger role. With that said, is it fair to assume that the measurable AMP line in your income statement we should expect that ratio to sales to remain lower than it has been historically? And secondly as you moved straight and move to essentially a counter revenue line item that we can\u2019t see in the P&L, it becomes a little hard to measure for us to see. So can you give us a sense of if we were able to group of trade and measurably compete together and look at that as a percentage of sales how that maybe changing year-to-date for fair versus previous year? Ian Cook : The last one is difficult to do Jason because one comes off gross and the other is measured against net. What I can tell you is that what you are calling trade spending is up this year. But to come back to you more fundamental question, a few things; number one, this notion of shopper marketing is not the third quarter 2015 comment. We have been trying to make this point unsuccessfully for the last two to three years for the reasons ID tailed a little bit earlier. We believe well done it is part of building brands. Number two, you're right digital I think will become an important way to target and reach different consumer groups going forward and that carries with it a different dollar to the traditional media. But no, I would not take the notion this forever going forward our traditional media to sales percentage, the one you do see will be lower and stay lower. That as I said earlier in response to a question I think we\u2019ll be the innovation spread and we have driven by the innovation spread that we have and as I said earlier even though we haven\u2019t finished the budget process, actually we haven\u2019t even started the budget process, but when you look at our innovation grid for the next three years starting in 2016, I think my expectation would be that you will see that ratio head back up a little bit in 2016. So it will move around I am just trying to assert that there is no good and bad, it\u2019s all in the marketing mix and they are all legitimate ways of engaging with consumers. And particularly in volatile times with high devaluations that closure if you will with the consumer on sale in those high devalued emerging markets happen in that retail environment. Jason English : So can you help me understand why it\u2019s hard to give us sense of the trade spend number? I mean you know the number instead of divided by growth, you could just divide it by net to give us the ratio. Am I over simplifying it by thinking about it that way? Ian Cook : No, you\u2019re not. We haven\u2019t done that, let us think about that, we could do that it is then a created number. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : So just on advertising, you\u2019ve mentioned it should go up next year. But do you think this level with abnormally low and you will see a big move upwards next year or is there plan for up but not materially so in 2016. And what are you seeing in terms of the decision on promo versus advertising from your major competitors. Because I asking in the context that Proctor sort of shifting some of their trying to realize more margin potentially as a detriment of sale in some cases? Thanks. Ian Cook : Well, first of all, I had tried to explain the third quarter this year. It is a quarter I wouldn\u2019t have said about it, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s abnormally low and therefore as we approach our 2016 budget we\u2019re saying oh we need to get it back up to X or Y level, I do believe, we do believe that with the richness of innovation we have the expectation will be that it will be up, how much it will be up, we will know when we finish our budgeted process. Now as you look around the world and something I elected not to say let\u2019s one sounds defensive but as you go around the world in many parts of the world you continue to see many of our multinational competitors pull back on traditional advertising quite substantially and then many of that fee market, even if you take the old fashioned measure of share or voice, we remain just on the face of it quite competitive. Now, we have seen some collaborating signals of certain businesses exited by competitors in order to realize price you see the public information in India and you see that in the market place. But if we take the breadth of our business, there is nothing I would point to say, the shape of the promotional environment that we\u2019re in has meaningfully changed. Olivia Tong : So I can just move to restructuring. Are you pushing harder on the initiatives you\u2019ve already outlined or these new areas that you will be exploring? And will this result in more savings starting in 2016 or is it just an extension to another year of savings? And as you think about reinvestment versus dropping to the bottom line, are there any shifts there in terms of how you think about this new tranche of restructuring savings. Ian Cook : Let\u2019s take a step back Olivia. Clearly, when we began this program, which by the way is a lot shorter than many of our competitors. But when we began the program we had three key areas and we said at the beginning that it was a global growth and efficiency program and that it was a journey. So, we were establishing hubs and we were establishing business service centers and we were transferring lifting and shifting if you will capabilities to the new structure that we were building that was supported by SAP across out Company. So this gives us the opportunity to transform a little bit what, we are doing with the new structure that we are creating and do it in a time bound window of 2017 rather than extending it over a longer period. So it is very definitely still within the three areas that we defined at the beginning of the restructuring, no new areas. It is definitely one more year. And as we said in the release we\u2019ll be coming back to you early in the New Year with flushed out ranges of costs for the program and savings. So on that one, we\u2019ll back to you in the new-year. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Steve Powers with UBS. Steve Powers : Great, thanks. I guess just to cleans up on topics already discussed on Venezuela acknowledging every situation is different, is it fair to assess at least the likelihood of deconsolidation rising on the margin, it feels that way from the outside. I just want to get your perspective on that? And second much to the restructuring that Olivia asked about, is there -- so should we\u2019ll be thinking about more opportunity in this next wave building on the hunting, thread, shared services is there a focus area within the three that is going to be of weight or maybe -- I am just trying to get a sense for where the incremental focus will go either in terms of focus stream or geography? Ian Cook : On your Venezuela comment, all I can say Steve is that this is something we revisit quarter-by-quarter based on the facts and circumstances that present themselves in each of the quarters and we will continue to do that. So I really and specifically do not want to share how we\u2019re thinking about it. We will be resolutely objective and make whatever decisions we think are appropriate based on the fact and circumstances at the time. Now when you turn to the restructuring, I would say simplistically and we will be back with richer commentary next year, I would say specifically what we\u2019re talking about and activities that will be more transformational in how we used the hubs we have created and how we use the service centers we have created more fulsomely. And I hold it there at this stage. So it is greater utilization around the basic structures that we will have fully established by next year. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Chris Ferrara : The SG&A excluding advertising in the quarter, looks likes it picked up maybe by 100 basis points year-on-year. So can you go through a little bit what might have driven that, I mean is that some of the shift in store, there is some promotional activity? Ian Cook : Chris that is straight forward leverage, our overheads -- our drawn [ph] overheads were actually down year-on-year with the benefits we\u2019re getting from the restructuring program. But there is a lot of overhead that is dollar denominated and when you have the downward pressure of 13% foreign exchange on the top-line you end up with a leverage negative and it is entirely traceable to that negative leverage. Chris Ferrara : I guess than the follow-up to that would be, why didn\u2019t we see it nearly to that extent last quarter when it was publicly a pretty similar dynamic around the top-line drivers? Ian Cook : I don\u2019t know, the only other mix in it is the mix of countries. So it may have been a country mix issue, we\u2019ll have to get back to you on that, I don\u2019t have the answer at my fingertips. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante : Good morning everyone. Actually my clarification has to do with Chris\u2019 because it seems like headquartered expenses run the highest since 2009 and I was surprised because of the having and is this Forex or something else going on in that line? And I do have a question with regards to commercial spending and category growth if I can. Thank you. Ian Cook : What you called it, corporate overhead is flat. So as I answered before on this quarter, it's definitely a leverage. And your question on spending is? Javier Escalante : Basically in the past and we know that the fact that this market shares are up across the board in oral care, it shouldn\u2019t be a huge change. But especially in the past when advertising has been down there have been commentary regarding aggregate commercial spending which include trader spending. And trader spending is typically in magnitude two to three times advertising. So could you tell us whether the aggregate of commercial spending is up or not and in the case of category you mentioned that the category has kind of like bottomed out, this is in reference to Bill Schmitz question? So could you clarify whether is it that the category we\u2019re seeing negative mix because of the price increases or actual volumes have slowdown? Because it seems as if considering all the market-share gains, all the pricing that you're taking in oral care the organics could have been better? So sorry for the too many questions. Thank you. Ian Cook : Well the oral care organic sales were better than the company average number one. Number two, in terms of total spending you're right, the trade spending as a ratio is a multiple of over three times the traditional advertising spending and relative to the category growth rates Bill\u2019s question was to do with volume and my answer to the question was a balance between volume and price. And he was asking whether the volume was bottoming out and would come back and I think the answer we gave was you would expect that balance to come back once the higher pricing that has being taken had worked its way through and that we didn\u2019t expect that to be earlier than 2016. Javier Escalante : But if I may, so the question that I have is based on your assessment are you seeing, when you talk about volumes there is this interplay between mix and actual tonnage if you will. So my question is whether because of the price increases you were seeing negative mix within Colgate\u2019s portfolio? Thank you. Ian Cook : And the answer is we\u2019re not going to get into that level of detail. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joe Altobello : Just had a question on pricing in Latin America, it sounds like in your answer to Javier that you\u2019re waiting on some of your competitors to match on the price increases you guys have taken. And I am just curious when you talk about your competitors in Latin America, are they mostly local competitors who don\u2019t have the same currency headwinds that you guys are facing right now, or are they multinationals who do have the same currency headwinds? Ian Cook : We have both, the locals tend to be more country specific, Columbia and Mexico. So they tend to be both. And if I said it then I apologize, I didn\u2019t mean to say it. We\u2019re not waiting on anybody. We have been taking pricing in Latin America and I would further say when you look at the breakdown of raw materials in today\u2019s world many of those raw materials are dollar denominated, so even a local competitor is going to get hit with the local currency transaction impact of raw materials coming into the country. So I would say that the incentive to price is fairly elevated across the board. Joe Altobello : Okay, that was my question, yeah. I was trying to get to when they would follow your lead essentially on the pricing side. And then on the follow up in terms of advertising spending, I know we\u2019ve beaten this to death a little bit here. But can you give us a sense for what U.S. advertising did in the quarter year-over-year? Thanks. Ian Cook : Again we\u2019re not going to get into that level of country by country detail. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : So if you could talk a little bit about Europe, actually, this is with organic sales being down this quarter, it\u2019s actually the first time we\u2019ve seen that in quite a while. So, big deceleration in volume and my understanding is there has been little bit of premium based innovation going into market, so just surprised to see volume which we know as volume and mix be so light. Could you talk a little bit about your, that would be great? Thank you. Ian Cook : I think when you look at the European environment obviously it\u2019s our lowest growth area of the world. I think the good news is that although pricing has been consistently negative in Europe if you look at the three quarters this year it has become positively less negative, unfortunately we had the volume negative in the third quarter. And I would say -- we would say that that is going to come back and we\u2019re certainly planning for positive organic growth going forward. Lauren Lieberman : Were there any particular big buckets of product launches, appointment, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s a pretty significant change in trend on volume? Ian Cook : The only thing I would comment to Lauren is that we had a situation in our Europe West grouping which is essentially our Germanic grouping which had to do with the transfer to a new distribution center which disrupted the shipments of that operation specifically in the quarter. So I think I know Europe was in part affected by that on the volume side which we see, A, as one time and B, already corrected and coming back in the fourth quarter. But it did have an effect beyond the usual market travails in Europe. Lauren Lieberman : And then just similarly on Latin America, it\u2019s pretty rare to see volume go negative. I mean I understand the pricing environment obviously and that volumes have been light. But it is rare to see volume go negative. So just thoughts on what comes next there, understanding shares have been solid and market growth you said is kind of stuck in the single digit? Ian Cook : Again you\u2019re right it has to do with the pricing. You can see that the pricing of course is more elevated than the prior two quarters in Latin America and we took strong pricing in Brazil which had an impact on volume and usually the way that works is that as I said earlier once the pricing works its way through than the volume comes back, the categories are still growing mid-single digit. So we hope things stay to the normal cycle of events. Lauren Lieberman : Thank you. And then just so the call doesn\u2019t end without anyone asking, could you share the gross margin bridge for the quarter? It will be great. Ian Cook : No. Lauren Lieberman : But then my model breaks down. Ian Cook : Third quarter the prior year gross profit was 58.6%, we got 140 basis points positive from pricing, but our funding the growth savings and the restructuring, we got favorable 270 basis points, so funding the growth continuing to do very well. On material pricing there was a headwind of 390 basis points and so the offset of the resulting 120 basis points negative to the 140 on pricing gets you the plus 20 and meaningfully over half of the 390 basis points negative was to do with the transaction impact to foreign exchange. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to John Faucher with JP Morgan. John Faucher : Yes, good morning and I guess its afternoon now. So I\u2019ll try to keep this quick. One clarification which is I think you said that Venezuela pricing was up 74% and if I look at that that would be pretty much all of the Latin America pricing. Ian Cook : No, no, John sorry, what I said was the official price increase that we were granted was 74% in the fourth quarter of last year. So on some businesses, so that is --. John Faucher : On some businesses, okay, I got it, that\u2019s what I thought, I just want to make sure. And then as we look out, I know you guys don\u2019t want to get into quarterly stuff here. If you look at it is a more difficult comparison as we look into the fourth quarter. Just sequentially, do you feel like more the pricing flows through and again not looking for specific guidance, but it seems like sort of the lower end of your four to seven range is probably the right way to be in the fourth quarter, is that the right way to think about it? Ian Cook : I am not sure, I would go all the way there John, I think we\u2019re comfortable with the four to seven range, I think your sense of pricing is right. We still have recovery to move the gross margin because to get to flat on the year, we have to be as you\u2019ll calculate from the squeeze, we have to be up on the quarter. So it will be within range, I think we are thinking if you take the nine months to it would be kind of around there. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Alex Paterson with AGI. Alex Paterson : Hi Ian, so just a couple of quick ones in the specialty pet channel, have you seen much in the way of a deflationary impact due to lower commodity cost which seem to be impacting the mass channel, has that flowed into that channel for you? And then secondly just curious about the cash you\u2019ve been building and the cash sources are you able to repatriate like you\u2019ve been able to do in the past the cash generation especially in emerging markets back to the U.S. whereas most of that locked into those markets? Ian Cook : On the first -- again without being glib, the answer is a simple, no. Particularly in our segment of the pet nutrition business which tends to be the more premium and so we have not seen it creep into specialty. Cash repatriation, Venezuela is Venezuela, absent Venezuela it's the same as it has always been. So we have the ability to repatriate sometimes timings is variable country-by-country but no change from prior. Operator : We\u2019ll take our last question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : So going back to the advertising, I guess the effectiveness of digital would seem to vary by category for various reason. So I am curious assuming if there is some truth to that, are there specific categories in which ads spend is still up year-on-year or up greater than it appears to be and maybe talk directionally about it category-by-category, if you can? Ian Cook : I probably could, but I am not going to. I don\u2019t think Mark because we\u2019re not going to get into that level of detail. I would say to your general point on digital, it\u2019s less category specific, although the category maybe linked to the user, its more which use that you're trying to get to and how they access. We just went through an extensive review for example in Latin America, majority of viewers millennial. They happen to be a growing majority of parents. They happen to do an awful lot on Facebook and they happen to be avid viewers of YouTube video. So do you want to connect with that group then the best way to get your advertising message to that group is YouTube videos and to do so in a way that is purpose driven. So if you were to Google all of that you\u2019d see some pretty interesting work from our point of view. But it tends to be more driven by the viewer than it does by the category. Okay. Well, good. Is that it? Operator : That\u2019s it. Ian Cook : Okay. Then, thank you all for your questions and thanks to all the Colgate people around the world that deliver the results. Thank you everybody. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Bina Thompson. Please go ahead, Bina. Bina Thompson : Thank you, Chanel. And good morning, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2015 earnings release conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. We\u2019re delighted to have finished 2015 with continued strong organic sales growth in the froth quarter. The 5% growth was well within our targeted growth rate of 4% to 7% and is impressive coming on top of strong growth in the year-ago quarter. Our gross profit margin was up 20 basis points despite continued pressures from foreign exchange related transaction costs. And although down on a year-over-year basis, our advertising as a percentage of sales was up sequentially from the third quarter. As you will hear in more details as I go through the divisions, our market share around the world are growing. Innovation has played an important role and will continue to do so as we enter 2016. Our global growth and efficiency program is on track and our ongoing funding-the-growth initiatives continue to deliver substantial savings. Our balance sheet is strong and working capital is under very good control. And as you read in this morning\u2019s press release, we have taken the decision effective December 31, 2015 to change our accounting method for our Venezuelan operations. And as a result, in future periods, we will no longer include the results of our Venezuelan operations in our consolidated financial statement. As we stated in the press release, we expect the EPS impact in 2016 resulting from the change in accounting for our Venezuelan operation will be about a negative of $0.10 for the full year. And we\u2019d expect this impact to be negative $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter. So let\u2019s turn to the divisions, first with North America. We\u2019re pleased with the continued solid organic sales growth in this region. And as mentioned in the press release, our market shares increased year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, liquid hand soap, body wash, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners. And as you\u2019d expect, innovation was an important contributor to these excellent results. In the third quarter of 2015, we launched Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste. This toothpaste remineralizes weakened enamel to help prevent cavities and maintain stronger teeth, as well as kills bacteria that cause gingivitis for healthier gums. In addition, we engaged in a targeted outreach to consumers with diabetes. People with diabetes are two times more likely to develop gum disease. We reached both dentists and consumers and developed retail partnerships. And as a result, our overall market share for Colgate Total toothpaste grew to 10.3% from 10% at the beginning of 2015. Our Colgate Optic White toothpaste franchise is growing as well, up to 5.7% at our last period of 2015, thanks to the launch of Colgate Optic White Platinum Express White. With the help of a comprehensive IMC plan, support from dental professionals and strong in-store activities, Colgate Enamel Health toothpaste has grown share as well. And toothpaste innovation will continue in the first quarter. Building on the success of our whitening franchise, we\u2019re launching Colgate Optic White Platinum High Impact [ph] White which provides four shades visibly whiter teeth in six weeks and starts working in just three days. Also, we\u2019re introducing premium-priced Colgate Enamel Health Mineral Repair toothpaste with an accompanying mouthwash and whitening toothbrush. The toothbrush and mouthwash help replenish natural calcium for stronger enamel. To bolster our toothbrush business, we\u2019re launching Colgate Kids Interactive, the only talking-powered toothbrush featuring kids\u2019 favorite licensed characters which coach you to better brushing. The brush features a two-minute timer to help ensure effective brushing. Also in the first quarter, Tom\u2019s of Maine is launching Tom\u2019s Natural Rapid Release Sensitive toothpaste with a clinically proven arginine and calcium carbonate formula to provide rapid release and long-lasting protection. With no artificial dyes, sweeteners or preservatives, it will be premium-priced. Our liquid hand soap share was up 90 basis points year-to-date. And our year-to-date body wash share increased 80 basis points. More innovation in this quarter should help maintain this healthy momentum. In liquid hand soap, we\u2019re launching Softsoap Foaming Hand Soap for kids that makes handwashing fun, as well as Softsoap Pure Foaming Hand Soap with a simple formula that is dye-free, alcohol-free, has 100% natural fragrance, yet effectively cleans and purifies. And in body wash, we\u2019re launching Softsoap Luminous Oils, one variant with avocado oil and iris and the other with macadamia oil and peony, designed to leave skin feeling soft. Turning then to Europe, South Pacific. We\u2019re delighted with the return to positive organic sales growth in this region. Across Europe, our market shares increased - toothpaste, toothbrushes, body wash, underarm and fabric conditioner. In the toothpaste category, we\u2019ve seen strong results. In France, our market share is up 80 basis points year-to-date to 22.4%. In Poland, we grew share 160 basis points to 47.6% year-to-date. And in Italy, we increased share 30 basis points to 24.6% year-to-date. Similarly, in manual toothbrushes, our market shares increased year-to-date. Overall in the region, our market shares are up 120 basis points to 24.7% year-to-date with excellent results in areas such as the UK, which is up 340 basis points to 39.3%; Germany, which is up a full point to 21%; and Italy, which is up 60 basis points to 16.4%. And as in the U.S., our innovation grid for the first quarter in Europe is very full. In the toothpaste category, we\u2019re introducing Colgate Total Deep Clean, which features high cleaning prophy-silica, the same ingredient dentists use for in-office cleaning. The product provides a deep-cleaning user experience and is unique among the current variants in the Colgate Total portfolio. In addition, we\u2019re restaging the Colgate Total toothpaste premium line with a new design that better communicates higher quality, healthier and scientific and therapeutic benefits. New icons visually convey the variant benefits, enhancing differentiation, relevance and shopability. In the toothbrush category, we\u2019re launching Colgate 360\u00b0 Expert White Toothbrush Plus Pen, the toothbrush and whitening pen that has helped increase market shares here in the U.S. under the Colgate Optic White name. And in personal care, we\u2019re relaunching Palmolive Gourmet shower gels with high-density creamy formulas and a new packaging technology that provides a premium look with high quality satin finishing and very strong shelf impact. Vanilla pleasure, chocolate passion, peach delight and strawberry touch will enchant consumers at point of sale. Also in personal care is the Palmolive SKIN GARDEN line, a premium offering with a regimen approach. The shower gel, bath foam, liquid hand soap, bar soap and body lotion contain irresistible fragrances, natural ingredients rooted in the garden such as violet and honey, peony, pear and Mirabelle plums, sensorial [ph] and vivid textures and cutting-edge packaging, all reinforcing the Palmolive regimen. And as we told you last quarter, our Sanex business is performing well and we have new news to report here as well. Our line of Sanex Advanced shower oils is bringing the shower oil trend from pharmacy to mass. The shower oils provide a feeling of comfort in the shower and are formulated to minimize the risk of irritation. These are even suitable for children, a new consumer target. Also inspired by the pharmacy channel are our new Sanex Advanced body bombs [ph] in a new stand-up tube format with a thicker, richer formula and premium pricing. Sanex Manual will also be launched, which is the first mask [ph] personal care range truly focused on men\u2019s skin health. As you know, we have a very strong market-leading homecare business in this region. And an exciting innovation in this category is a line of Ajax specialty sprays which facilitate difficult everyday tasks in the kitchen. Priced at a premium, individual variants tackle different surfaces - the oven and microwave, MicroCeramic and stainless steel. So turning then to Latin America. Despite some macroeconomic challenges in certain countries such as Brazil and Venezuela, the division delivered solid organic sales growth. Severe devaluations across the region have necessitated fairly significant price increases. But despite that, our regional market shares are solid and increase year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, toilet soaps, shampoos and liquid cleaners. In Brazil, our toothpaste market share continues to climb up 100 basis points year-to-date to 72.4% with the most recent lead at 73.4%. Innovations across our portfolio have contributed to this success. In Mexico, despite continued competitive pressure, our market share is up 120 basis points to 80.8%. One of our newest innovations, Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Neutrazucar increased 70 basis points and is now almost at 2 points. Our market-leading manual toothbrush share is up 350 basis points year-to-date across the region. This excellent performance has been driven by innovation in the Super Premium category with products such as Colgate Slim Soft and Colgate 360. In toilet soaps, we increased our leadership share 40 basis points to 30.9% year-to-date. Protex and Palmolive continue to hold the number one and number two positions in the region. And we achieved record shares in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala. More innovation is planned for this year. In oral care whitening category, we have three exciting launches. In toothpaste, we\u2019re launching Colgate Luminous White Advanced Expert, which delivers three shades whither teeth; A companion Colgate Luminous White mouthwash with an alcohol, free zinc and anti-tartar salts formula that helps deliver an anti-stain white smile; and Colgate Luminous White Advanced toothbrush and whitening pen with a claim to provide whiter teeth in two days will both be launched later this year. In mouthwash, a graphics relaunch of Colgate Plax 2-in-1 mouthwash clearly explains the benefits, see the [ph] removed bacteria for a fresh and clean mouth and to drive growth for the category. In personal care, under the Protex name, we\u2019re launching a range of bar soaps, shower gel and liquid hand soaps. Protex Pro Hydrate, developed from the consumer insight that to have healthy and moisturized skin is necessary to deeply clean skin before moisturizing, this innovation has a formula that eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and has a macadamia oil complex that glides over your skin for a soft sensation. A similar range under the Palmolive equity will be Palmolive almond and omega oil with a nourishing formula. In underarm, a relaunch of premium-priced Lady Speed Stick Clinical and Speed Stick Clinical will provide the benefits of superior sweat protection, neutralizing the source of bad odor, hypoallergenic, anti-stain technology and advanced skin care. Turning then to Asia. While organic sales growth was somewhat muted in this region in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re pleased that volume increased in our largest businesses - Greater China and India. And this, despite some overall slowing in category growth rates. And as elsewhere, innovation has helped drive growth. In India, our toothpaste share is up to 54.7% year-to-date. Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent and a relaunch of the rest of our sensitivity line have met with success. In addition, Colgate Total Charcoal with a unique antibacterial formula which reduces bacteria on 100% of your mouth\u2019s surfaces has added market share. Elsewhere in the region, our toothpaste shares were a little soft on a year-to-date basis but market shares for the fourth quarter increased versus fourth quarter 2014 in China, Thailand, The Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Pakistan. Our year-to-date toothbrush shares are also up in India, The Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Pakistan. A particular success has been Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal Gold toothbrush with less than 0.01 millimeter charcoal gold slim tip antibacterial bristles for deep, gentle cleaning. In the most recent period, it achieved 2.1, 3.6 and 2.2 share points respectively in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. In the fourth quarter in Hong Kong, we launched our Colgate Optic White toothbrush and whitening pen and it has a 6.4% share in the latest read. Our mouthwash business is strong. Across the region, our market share is up to 25.7% year-to-date, up 70 basis points year-on-year with the most recent lead at 26.5%. And we have some exciting innovation launching this quarter. In China, where natural ingredients resonate very strongly with the consumer, we will be introducing Colgate Naturals toothpaste. There are five variants - tea tree oil gum care, lemon zesty radiating white, jasmine and chamomile healthy refreshing, lotus jade green soothing gum and seaweed salt pure white. The packaging visually communicates the different ingredients. And we have a number of new products in the toothbrush category. Colgate Slim Soft Sensitive, a silky soft brush for sensitive teeth and gums; Colgate Super Flexi Black, with a flexible neck and improved handle; and a line of mid-tier brushes for kids with tapered bristles. To maintain our momentum in mouthwash, we\u2019re launching in China Colgate Plax Extreme Icy Mint mouthwash, which delivers long-lasting prevention of bad breath with dual mint essence as well as an antibacterial protection. Then going to Africa, Eurasia. As you know, currency headwinds in this part of the world have necessitated some significant pricing in countries such as Russia, but market shares are solid and growing. Our year-to-date regional toothpaste market share is at 33.2%, up a full point from a year-ago period. In Russia, our share is up 260 basis points year-to-date to 34.5%, reaching a record-high of 35.2% in the most recent period. In South Africa, our market share is up 80 basis points year-to-date to 49.6%. And our recent launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer in both these countries has contributed to these strong results. In manual toothbrushes, our market shares are up in many countries across the region. In Russia, our year-to-date share is up 260 basis points to 48.4%. Excellent in-store execution has played an important role in these results. In Israel, two new products, Colgate Extra Clean and Colgate Slim Soft, helped increase our year-to-date share by 300 basis points to 51.2% with the most recent share read at a record 55.6%. Our bar soap business is strong as well, up 80 basis points to 21.7% on a year-to-date basis. And in South Africa, the Protex brand is helping grow the business and our market share is up 20 basis points on a year-to-date basis. In Russia, Palmolive is leading growth driven by promotional support as well as strong in-store execution. Our year-to-date share is up 50 basis points. And we have some exciting innovations for this part of the world as well. This quarter, we will be launching Colgate Total Pro Breath Health [ph] toothpaste across the division. The differentiated packaging with icons on the pack clearly explains the benefits, which include a unique breath-freshening technology, ON12 [ph] complex. Another toothpaste launch will be the Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent line extension. This premium-priced toothpaste repairs the cause of sensitivity and prevents further sensitivity from gum recession. And an innovation for the Russian market is Colgate Altai Herbs Ginseng, with an exclusive blend of Altai herbs and ginseng. In the personal care category, we are relaunching our existing line of Palmolive Aroma Sensations body washes and adding two new variants, Feel Good and So Dynamic. Finally, with Hill\u2019s. Hill\u2019s finished the year with a strong quarter, both here and abroad. All three brands - Prescription Diet, Science Diet and Ideal Balance - are doing well. In fact, Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet or flagship line of therapeutic pet foods became a $1 billion brand in 2015. In the U.S., superstore retail consumption is growing in both PetSmart and Petco, which contributed to our solid results. In Europe, our Ideal Balance line is now fully rolled out across all key countries and doing well. We\u2019re seeing a steady build of distribution and volume. Our integrated marketing campaign is focusing on trial and repurchase. And we\u2019re very excited about our upcoming innovation. Just launched at the North American Vet Conference is Prescription Diet Derm Defense for dogs. This diet is the first and only nutrition formulated to reduce signs of environmental allergies by helping to disrupt the internal allergy response and create a barrier against future episodes in dogs. It\u2019s available in dry and delicious new [ph] forms and of course will be supported by a full IMC campaign to engage the increasingly millennial vet population. Hill\u2019s will also be entering the wearables space. Hill\u2019s has formed a strategic alliance with AGL to advance veterinary healthcare with the development of a wearable sensor for dogs that is sophisticated enough to distinguish the acts of scratching and shaking from running. Coupled with a robust data and analytics platform, it\u2019s designed to more quickly alert veterinarians and pet owners to potential health concerns as part of an ongoing monitoring program. It will be recommended for dogs that need to be regularly monitored, including those with dermatological conditions, arthritis, or obesity. New news in the wellness category is premium-priced Hill\u2019s Science Diet healthy cuisine for dogs and cats, which uses our new Algenec [ph] technology to deliver superior-looking, tasty wet food. The new formulas are loaded with tasty morsels, tender vegetables and savory sauce. So before I wrap up quickly, I want to cover two more housekeeping items relative to your models. Net interest in 2016 should be between $30 million and $45 million to quarter with a loss of interest income in Venezuela. Average diluted common shares outstanding were 896.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015. Because we had a GAAP loss in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the one-time charge with Venezuela, this number excludes 6.6 million of net incremental common shares outstanding assumed issued from the exercises in the money stock options as they\u2019re anti-dilutive. We\u2019d expect the 6.6 million shares to be included in diluted common shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2016 as they should not be anti-dilutive in this period. So in summary, we\u2019re extremely pleased with the way that we finished the year. Organic sales growth was strong around the world, our gross margin increased and our market shares are healthy. Colgate people around the world are all focused on our strategies and priorities, thereby delivering these consistent strong results. Our global growth and efficiency program is on track and these are ongoing funding-the-growth programs. Our innovation pipeline is full and we\u2019re excited about the many products and initiatives we just told you about. So we expect this momentum to continue into 2016 and look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go throughout the year. So, Chanel, that\u2019s the end of my prepared remarks. I should like to turn it over now to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Today\u2019s question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically for the telephone audience. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning. So, Ian, you had very strong pricing in the quarter both at the corporate level and in Latin America but the volume reaction looked more severe than what we\u2019ve seen traditionally in your business, particularly in Latin America. So I was hoping you could just discuss consumer demand elasticity in this current macroenvironment if you\u2019re seeing any different behavior versus past with the macro slowdown we\u2019re seeing in Latin America and then how that may impact your desire to take additional pricing going forward to offset incremental FX pressure. And then that\u2019s at the consumer level, but at the competitor level, what are you generally seeing from your competitors? Are they following and can you characterize the competitive environment that you\u2019re seeing? Thanks Ian Cook : Yes, thanks, Dara. And before I jump in, let me just take this belated opportunity to wish everyone on the call a happy, healthy and safe 2016 in this volatile world. And when we turn to that volatile world, we\u2019re actually very pleased with the results in 2015, as Bina said, with consistent 5% organic top line growth in the quarter and in the year and with our gross margin building from the second quarter to 59% in the fourth quarter, which is the highest in two years in that environment which positions us well to see margin expansion in 2016. And I\u2019ll come back to that when we no doubt talk about margin. But turning to how we think about the business in the environment everybody is operating in, first of all, we seek to have clarity and consistency of strategy. And we have that for the last decade with a simple and focused strategy that starts with consumers and ends with the leadership development in the company to deliver our products to those consumers. Then you have the balance between the consistency of the results by quarter and our ambition of the longer-term which are captured in the global growth and efficiency program in terms of building the organization we want for the future. And then, of course, the decisions we make on the ground and the agility that\u2019s required to deal with events as they unfold. Now, if you look at Latin America to this specific question, obviously, the foreign exchange headwind there as it was in Africa, Eurasia, was the most severe we experienced in our world for 2015. And when we think about the consumers, we think about the brands and the health of our brands and the development of the market share of our brand. But obviously, we need to be focused on rebuilding the margin which is the fulcrum for investment in a business. So in both those divisions, we took conscious decision to take pricing to help recover gross margin and suffered the volume decline you see. We feel, however, very comfortable because of the performance of our market shares whether you look at the value market share and local currency as Bina talked specifically to Brazil or whether you look at the volume market shares in that region, they\u2019re up. So the consumer is staying with us and the consumer is staying with us across the portfolio of brands that we have. And as we think forward into 2016 now, I guess a couple of things to say. And it relates to the gross margin. First of all, the enormous translation headwind we faced in 2015 will still be there in 2016, but it will be at a lesser level. Second, the general commodity pricing environment year-on-year will be flat to modestly down. Third, we have our funding the growth program which we talk about every call, which we expect to build the same way it has done for the last several years. We have the global growth and efficiency program. And on top of that, we have pricing. But we have less pricing in 2016 than we had in 2015. And half of that pricing without Venezuela is still rollover pricing into 2016. So our planning expectation is that we will see the balance between volume and pricing move back a little bit more to volume and less to pricing. And that will include Latin America and we expect our market shares to continue to grow. So the consumer behavior hasn\u2019t changed. We haven\u2019t seen down trading. And we\u2019re confident about the reversal back to volume more and price less in 2016 for Latin America and the overall business. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. Can I just follow-up on that last one just in terms of the outlook maybe in the near-term to manage expectations? I know the comps in Latin America on the volume, so either really tough in the first half of \u201816. So do you think we\u2019re going to see negative volume growth maybe for the next quarter or two, potentially even worse than we just saw in the fourth quarter in Latin America? But then broadly, I also wanted to ask more strategically, Asia, the slowdown in category growth that you\u2019re seeing there, it surprises me that we\u2019re seeing a slowdown in category growth given the very low per capita consumption levels. I get in Latin America, but not so much in Asia. So can you talk about Asia, specifically China and India? I think you called out - do you think there\u2019s something more structural there? Do you think that it\u2019s going to take a longer time? Do you really think it\u2019s an economic factor that\u2019s leading to the slowdown of the growth? If you could talk about that, that would be great. Thanks. Ian Cook : Yes. I think in Latin America, the expectation is to see - not to see the kind of volume negative that we had in the fourth quarter as we set our way into 2016. Obviously, it will build across the year. But no, we don\u2019t expect to repeat of that level. When you turn to Asia, and if you look at the emerging markets in general, the local currency growth rates in category is still mid-single digits, maybe slightly off that in the fourth quarter. We haven\u2019t seen anything dramatic in terms of a change in behavior thus far. We\u2019re obviously very focused on that, Wendy, as you would suppose we would be. And pleasingly, I can report that the market shares in China and India has been mentioned with India, are both out nicely in 2015. So we stay close to it. Right now, we continue to see cash agreements growing around mid-single digits in local currency terms. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Powers with UBS. Steve Powers : Great. Thanks. Just one more on the volume if I could just to clean it up. Ian, can you just talk away to the volume softness that you\u2019ve seen in response to pricing has been at all more pronounced on the personal and home care side of things versus oral care or if it\u2019s about equal? And then a few months ago you\u2019d indicated that you saw traditional advertising ratios would be up again as a percentage of sales in 2016. And as we\u2019ve talked about, good deal has changed, since then the macroenvironment, so I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s still your expectation in terms of what\u2019s embedded in your outlook, the Super bowl ad notwithstanding. Thanks. Ian Cook : The answer to your first question on volume is no, not really. It has more to do with the short-term slowdown in relation to the level of increase in pricing you take regardless of which category you\u2019re taking pricing in. On the advertising side, I won\u2019t repeat too much of an old story. But I would say, back to this notion of marketing mix, when we think about advertising, we think about everything from educating kids in schools to get dental professionals and veterinary professionals to make a recommendation before the consumer has even purchased a product, to engaging with consumers to the various different media that we can avail ourselves of increasingly digital, but also the so called traditional media and then of course a strong belief in making that engagement carry through to the retail level where we think that expenditure can build a brand health and value as well. But as we said on the last call, we expected as we got into our budgeting process that our innovation flow would be such that we would expect to see coming into 2016, an increase in the traditional advertising while still using the in-store lever as well. And indeed, as you might imagine, given richness of innovation that Bina went through in her prepared remarks, that is exactly where we have ended up with our plan. And so I can say that our advertising, the traditional advertising, for 2016 is up both on an absolute basis and of course on a ratio basis as well given that strength of innovation. Operator : And let\u2019s go to our next question from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz : Hi, good morning. Ian Cook : Hey, Bill. Bill Schmitz : Hey, a couple of things. How do you define strong organic growth? Because I\u2019m trying to figure out how that sort of plays out relative to Venezuela. So can you tell us how much Venezuela contributed to organic growth now that kind of the cat\u2019s out of the bag on the earnings side? And then sort of how you think organic growth is going to play out next year? Ian Cook : Yes. Well, let me just say, Bill, in response to your question, when you say how do you define strong organic growth, I think we would say in the environment wherein the range we had 4% to 7% bookends strong organic growth and 5% for 2015 in that regard is therefore strong. And the way we\u2019re thinking about 2016 without Venezuela is exactly the same way which is to say our target for organic growth is to grow in that 4% to 7% range without Venezuela. And I can report that I have to say from a top line point of view, the year is off to a bright start. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Ian Cook : Hey, Jason. Jason English : Thank you for the question and happy New Year to you as well. I want to come back on Venezuela real quick just to make sure we understand the math. I think in the last Q, you filed that you listed around 4% of sales, 2% of EBIT, clearly more UPS with interest income that you talked about. But on the EBIT side, the math I know on very rounding numbers suggest that removal of Venezuela is going to be about a 50 basis point contribution of EBIT margins. Is that sort of directionally right? And if so, can you comment sort of bigger picture on how you are thinking about margins overall next year both with and without that tailwind? Ian Cook : Yes. Well, we don\u2019t tend to talk about EBIT margin, Jason, so let me turn to gross margin which as you know we regard as the fulcrum of everything. So as I said, gross margin, up 20 bps to 59 in the fourth quarter. And perhaps I should take the opportunity now before Lauren comes on and chides me of going through the row fort for that fourth quarter gross profit. So if you go to the gross profit in the prior year, was 58.8. Pricing, our strongest showing for the year, up 1.6 percentage points, so positive 1.6 points. Restructuring and funding the growth, 290 basis points, positive 2.9. Material prices, 420 negative, of which 240 was transaction, modest negative with all other and you get to the 59. Now, as we roll that forward to 2016 and the plans we have, we feel good about our ability to meaningfully increase gross margin in 2016. And we would say that we expect to have gross margin expansion in 2016 to be in that 75 to 125 range. Part of the reason, as I said earlier, is the less aggressive foreign headwind. But as I also said earlier, we have pricing less, but half of it rollover, we have funding the growth which you know very well. We have the global growth and efficiency program. And we expect to see that gross margin expansion begin in the first quarter of 2016. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hi guys. Ian Cook : Hi Ali. Ali Dibadj : I wanted to drill down on two things. One is SG&A and then just a broader question on SKU proliferation. First on SG&A, I know we\u2019ve talked a lot about ad spend, you know, it is the seventh quarter in a row we\u2019re seeing ad spend as the percentage sales go down. But your point earlier, your shares aren\u2019t moving as you confirm both volume and value. It doesn\u2019t like it\u2019s moving. So how much more of a shift do you think you can do from ad spend to in-store? And kind of what are you watching just to make sure you don\u2019t go into the olden days\u2019 fear of just hurting the brand and it becomes a risk from that perspective? So kind of what are you watching? How much more you can go? And on non-advertising, ex-advertising SG&A, I thought we would see more benefit because of the hubbing and the restructuring and everything that we talked about there. Why are we not seeing there? So that\u2019s the SG&A question. And then on the SKU proliferation or innovation question, how do you guys - so every quarter we hear really interesting things, being briefly out of breath describing them at the start of every quarter. How do you guys deal with SKU proliferation? Is there a very clear discipline of put one in, take on out? Or how do you deal with that? And if you give us a sense of your number of skews you guys sell over the years and how much that\u2019s gone up, it\u2019s just something that struck me listening that again. Thanks. Ian Cook : Yes, yes. Well, thanks to your one question as usual. But let\u2019s turn to the advertising. And I mentioned in the introductory comments the word of balance. And you and I had this conversation on the last call. We don\u2019t view this as either/or, we view this as what do we need to do to create the trial and repeat of our brands, build health over time and ultimately build market share with more consumers using our products. And I wasn\u2019t quite sure what you meant when you said your market share is not moving. It is moving and it\u2019s moving up. And Bina went through some of those examples. And when we think about advertising, we think about, as I said earlier, marketing mix from the school room to the dental office, to the store and all of the other media through which you can reach people including digital, including television, including magazine and advertising and the like, even billboards in Africa. And we think about that balance all the time to make sure that our brand health doesn\u2019t weaken over time. And I said that the advertising would be up absolutely and as a percent to sales in 2016. And we have quite a list of measures that we look at from trial to repeat to various brand health measures which we prac over time so that we don\u2019t get to a point where you start to, shall we say, take more out of a brand than you are putting back into a brand. And that\u2019s back to that word, balance. We think we\u2019ve kept the right balance in 2015. When we go into 2016 with the portfolio and the brand objectives that we have for 2016, we\u2019re taking up the traditional. We will continue to use the in-store as part of our marketing mix and we will monitor very, very closely the trial and repeat measures we have in terms of the new innovation and the brand health measures that we have in terms of the brands Colgate, Sonic, et cetera, that we have around the world, because we\u2019re a marketing company. And that\u2019s what we do. So I think you can be reassured that it\u2019s not one or the other. We\u2019re not trying to push from one to the other. We\u2019re just trying to register the point that we have to think about the mix of all of the engagement points we have with consumers. And as I said before, you have a 74 share in Brazil. That\u2019s how much of the shelf you have. You can have an enormous impact with the consumer in the store. Your SKU proliferation point of view is spot on. It is always a risk that you end up in the hunt for innovation of this risk of over proliferating. I can\u2019t say that we have a strict one in, one out policy. That would not be correct. I can say that as a company measure, from the top of the house, we monitor our SKUs by division, by business and overall as a company. And thankfully, our SKU count has been coming down. And now, within that, you have cycles when you\u2019re replacing and you\u2019ve got a double count. But it\u2019s something we watch really at the top of the house. And it\u2019s a central part of our simplification initiatives because it touches everything, the factory, the inventory, you could imagine all of the touch points. So it\u2019s a fair question. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at risk of over proliferating with the innovation we have because we have a discipline to bring the overall numbers down year upon year. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joe Altobello : Thank you. Good morning. Hey guys. I guess I just want to go back to gross margin for a second and the 75 to 125 bps expansion outlook for this year. That seems to be your evergreen target. And I was looking at my model and if it\u2019s right, you guys haven\u2019t done that since 2009. So it\u2019s been a while and I understand there\u2019s been a lot of external factors that have kind of crept up here. But how much confidence do you have in that? And I guess how do we think about raw materials ex the transactional impact of currency in that? And how do we think about the exclusion of Venezuela in terms of the dynamics of that gross margin expansion? Thanks. Ian Cook : Yes. Well, how you think about it - I mean first of all, there is no one more keenly aware of our gross margin plateaus than us, number one. Number two, when we think about it, again, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, from that transaction point of view, although foreign exchange continues to be a negative, it is less of a negative than what we endured in 2015. Now, of course, that improvement builds over the year, but still overall it is less negative. As I also mentioned earlier, underlying commodity cost with [indiscernible] even at 35, are basically flat to modestly down. That\u2019s favorable. Third, we have the funding, the growth program that we have had every year and we track through quarter by quarter. And you will see the history and you now know the history for 2015. And that\u2019s our goal and objective for 2016. And as I said, we have pricing lesser than last year, of which 50% is rollover. Now, Venezuela clearly adds benefit to gross margin. But I would say that we definitely feel that 2016 is the year we need to raise our gross margin and the proof will be in the pudding when we talk next at the end of the first quarter. Everything that we know we feel confident about that. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline Levy : Thank you so much. Hi, Bina and Ian. Ian, just a more commentary if you wouldn\u2019t mind walking around a couple of big markets - China, Brazil, Mexico, Russia - just the state of the consumer. I mean from where we sit sometimes, things can sound really dire. But what are you hearing from your country leaders and people on the ground about the consumer sentiment? And is it significantly worse in any one of those areas than in another? Ian Cook : Well, it is difficult to find anybody with anything optimistic to say about much of anything these days. Without being overly general, I would say that the underlying consumer sentiment and behavior in China and India is okay. I would say that the underlying consumer sentiment in Mexico is okay. I would say that the underlying consumer sentiment in Russia is not great. And that would be English understatement. And I would say in Brazil, the underlying sentiment in Brazil is not great. And we have said before that again, our objective is to grow market share for our brands in those environments. I think we have said before that we think Brazil is not an overnight fix. And we will stay the course. But again, if you take this generalized view, I think there are still more of the emerging countries where the underlying consumer sentiment is okay. Russia and Brazil would not be in that group in 2015. And we don\u2019t believe in 2016 either. And although it\u2019s a smaller part of our business, that would also apply to some of the African countries, but they are smaller. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Thanks, good morning. Ian Cook : Hey Bill. Bill Chappell : Just a follow-up, could you quantify what the organic growth was last year ex Venezuela? And then the other question, on share repurchase, I\u2019m not sure if you commented on that on what it was in the quarter. But is there any thoughts with kind of stock, where it\u2019s been? And in the past, you\u2019ve certainly used opportunities to step up and use a little more cash? Is that a though right now? Ian Cook : Okay. The answer on Venezuela is polite no. So I repeat, we delivered 5% organic growth in the fourth quarter and in 2015. And we are guiding that we will deliver the same organic range between 4% and 7% excluding Venezuela in 2016. As we think about the share repurchases, one has to be thoughtful about capital structure in the environment wherein given the foreign exchange impact on cash profit. And as we have gone through our capital structure right now, and we have not made this decision yet, but I think it would be fair to say as a company that we have been for since 1895 I think committed to paying dividend and have increased it for the last 50 plus years. So that\u2019s a decision yet to be made, but that is obviously a use of cash so is capital expenditure which is very focused on supporting our global growth and efficiency program. And then we turn to share buyback. Right now, our capital structure would say our gross share buyback for this year would be in the 1 billion to 1.3 billion range. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. I would never chide you in, first of all. Ian Cook : I did it already. Lauren Lieberman : I had a question on Europe. When I spent some time with panels, middle of last year, we talked quite a bit about premium innovations and it struck me that sort of newer direction, a different way of dealing with the longstanding deflationary environment in Europe. So if you could talk a little bit about how those efforts are going on premium innovation, if it\u2019s a strategy you\u2019re thinking about taking a more significant way into other markets, that would be really helpful. Thank you. Ian Cook : Yes. Well, it is well underway. I mean as we went through our 2016 budget program, I think you may have had a sneak peek on stuff we haven\u2019t yet seen here. But that is very much underpinning the European plan for 2016 and some of those products are moving into the marketplace as Bina mentioned as we speak right now. And it would be fair to say that depending on the market, depending on the condition of the consumer, that is the model that is under serious study and indeed has already been adopted in certain parts of the world. But to the extent that it can be deployed, you expect that it will be. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante : Good morning everyone. My question has to do - hello, how are you? My question has to do with reports on the British press that Glaxo is considering to sell off its consumer division. And I would like to hear your thoughts with regards to whether this asset which includes Sensodyne, is something that you would consider as strategic for Colgate on one end? On other, to what extent with the restructuring savings ending in 2016, whether financially will of interest as well as a means to generate savings? Thank you. Ian Cook : Well, first of all, I\u2019m hesitant to comment on the British press, Javier. Javier Escalante : Okay, I understand. But what about Glaxo consumer? Is it something that - is it kind of - I know that you are very choosy and very financially disciplined, but do you think that this is something that it would be of interest to Colgate to consider? Ian Cook : The only proper answer to that question is that we don\u2019t comment on market speculation and rumor or the British press. Operator : And our final question comes from John Faucher with JP Morgan. John Faucher : Thank you very much. Two questions here. The first is, a lot more discussion about the local brands and things like that. Yet as you said, your market shares are generally increasing. Can you talk about what you\u2019ve seen from them from a transactional pricing standpoint? And then the second question is probably, it\u2019s a little bit of a devil\u2019s advocate question and probably not one you\u2019re expecting, which is when you talked about having the flexibility of sort of the touch points, right, advertising versus trade and in-store, what have you, and given that dialogue you\u2019ve had over the last 6 to 12 months, wouldn\u2019t that argue that longer-term that the gross margin expansion which we\u2019ve been looking for is less relevant, right? It seems as though if you have that marketing mix flexibility, it should be about the operating margin, not the gross margin. So I guess sort of putting it back in your court in that regard, doesn\u2019t the gross margin lose some of its importance overtime if you\u2019re moving these buckets around more? Thanks. Ian Cook : So let me answer the question of the local brand pricing. I guess for those materials that are dollar-denominated, they say it\u2019s the same pressures that we do. And many of these local brands are not classic cheapies. They are reasonably well-priced products. I must say I can\u2019t give you a chapter and verse review on have they mimicked the pricing we have. But we certainly haven\u2019t seen them going the other way. So either they are premium in many cases and they stayed there or I think I could say that they will have moved their pricing. We haven\u2019t seen them trying to go the other way. On the marketing mix comment, I would be careful to argue about the flexibility. I think what it gives us is against the objectives we have for a brand or an innovation or against a particular consumer, what is the best way to think about all of the touch points in terms of reaching them. I made the comment on the last call that over half of moms today in Latin America are Millennials that Facebook and YouTube are enormous connection points for that community. So that\u2019s a great place to go to touch those kind of consumers. And I think personally, gross margin remains as important because what you\u2019re trying to do there, I think, is to create value in a product that the consumer sees and is prepared to pay for back to Lauren\u2019s point about premium by innovation. And it\u2019s off that fulcrum, everything else comes because otherwise from an operating point of view, you\u2019re only leaving yourself really leveraged overhead and advertising to deal with. So I think a gross margin focus should be an un-remising focus in a consumer products company in our types of businesses. Ian Cook : Okay. Well, I\u2019m pleased and surprised pleasantly by the duration of the call. Thank you for all of the questions. And we look forward to keeping you updated as the year unfolds. Thank you very much. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Now, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Bina Thompson. Please go ahead, Bina. Bina H. Thompson - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. And welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings release conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. We're delighted with our strong start to the year. Organic sales growth is well within our targeted range of 4% to 7%. Our gross profit margin reached a long-standing goal of 60%. Advertising as a percent of sales was at a solid 10.6%, even with the year-ago quarter, but up 230 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2015, behind strong new product activity. Currency headwinds continued in the quarter, and we were able to take pricing to partially offset those headwinds and still deliver volume growth. And, as you will hear as I go through the divisions, our market shares are strong and growing. We are well into our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Savings are projected to be within our announced ranges. And our funding-the-growth initiatives have delivered another solid 130 basis points benefit on the gross margin line in the quarter. Current estimates show the benefits from these funding-the-growth initiatives increasing as we go through the year. Our balance sheet is solid. Working capital is down from the prior year. We announced a dividend increase effective this quarter, and our share buyback program continues. So then, let's turn to the divisions, starting with North America. This division reported solid results. Innovation helped to fuel growth, and our market shares were up or stable in eight of 11 categories. Our new products were well-supported with impactful integrated marketing campaigns, with activation in-store, as well as in traditional media and digital. In toothpaste, as mentioned, we've achieved market leadership on the year-to-date basis, up 50 basis points to almost 36% of the market. And you may recall that we launched Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste in the third quarter of 2015. This quarter, we launched a companion mouthwash, which allowed us to offer a regimen approach and was supported by shelf displays in-store. As a result, Colgate Total toothpaste achieved its highest first quarter share since 2013. We continue to expand our line of Colgate Optic White whitening toothpaste with the launch of High Impact White. Priced at an uber-premium price point, this innovation offers four shades visibly whiter teeth by brushing twice daily for six weeks. Part of our integrated marketing campaign associated with the launch was sponsorship of the 2016 Country Music Awards, with displays in the presenter holding room as well as the Colgate Optic White hair and makeup Room. The Colgate Optic White line, now with six variants, all premium or uber-premium priced, holds a record 6% market share year-to-date. Also, in the first quarter, we launched Colgate Enamel Health Mineral Repair toothpaste, which helps repair weakened enamel with vital minerals. The launch was supported by a Smile with Strength campaign, one of the strongest testing campaigns ever for the Enamel Health range. And, in addition, we provided strong support to the dental professionals, with extensive sampling, print ads in dental journals, conventions, education and detailing. We continue to widen our lead in the manual toothbrush category. A significant contributor has been our line of Colgate 360\u00b0 toothbrushes. The most recent introduction was Colgate 360\u00b0 Enamel Health Whitening toothbrush, a differentiated and incremental innovation, which brought the 360\u00b0 franchise share to a record 23% year-to-date. Our body wash shares are up 50 basis points year-to-date to 9.5%. Contributing to this success is our new line of Softsoap Luminous Oils body wash, formulated to leave the skin feeling soft after showering. And in early reads, it is exceeding our performance expectations. For men, we launched Irish Springs Signature for Men Clean & Scrub exfoliating body wash, crafted with authentic oat extract as well as the classic Irish Springs scent in a convenient pump. Turning then to Europe/South Pacific, results were solid in this division as well. A very full innovation grid fueled volume and market share growth. Market shares increased year-to-date in toothpaste, toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap, deodorants and fabric conditioners. Our toothbrush share across Europe increased 40 basis points, increasing our market-leading position. Similarly, in manual toothbrushes, we extended our number one position by 170 basis points year-to-date; and in fabric conditioner, by 150 basis points year-to-date. In toothpaste, our first quarter launch of Colgate Total Deep Clean has helped drive share. To build on the success of the Colgate Total line, we also launched Colgate Total Proof, with color change technology so you can see it working. In the sensitivity segment, we're launching Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Extra Strength toothpaste, which stops sensitivity pain instantly by repairing the open channels to sensitive tooth nerves and strengthens the protective layer while strengthening the teeth. And under the elmex brand, we're launching elmex Repair & Prevent toothpaste, which repairs sensitive areas of teeth to prevent further sensitivity. Now, we told you last quarter about the launch of Colgate Expert White Toothbrush + Built-In Whitening Pen. This launch is off to a very strong start. In the second month of launch, we reached almost a 20% share in France and almost 15% in Belgium. So this quarter, we're taking the device plus chemistry format into the sensitivity segment with the launch of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Toothpaste + Built-In Sensitivity Pen. This provides instant and long-lasting sensitivity relief with a targeted application; simply brush, treat and go. As with oral care, our personal care new product pipeline has been full and has helped increase our share in body wash, soaps and deodorants. We told you last quarter about a very exciting premium priced line, Palmolive Skin Garden. This regimen approach offering of body wash, bath foam, liquid hand soap and bar soap has met with early success. Our Sanex innovations, Sanex Advanced Shower Oils and Body Balms, are also driving results. In France, for example, our Sanex body wash shares is at 10.6% year-to-date, up almost two full points from the year-ago period, and the leading brand in the market. To keep up the momentum this quarter, we're launching Sanex Soft Freshness underarm protection, filling an important portfolio gap. Freshness is among the top consumer expectations in the category, and is highly incremental to our portfolio, with a unique formula that slowly releases pleasant fragrances. And in fabric conditioner, we're very excited about our new line of Soupline Complete Care, which we expect to further drive our leading share position. At a super-premium price, this new product employs innovative technology to deliver three sought- after benefits : irresistible softness, anti-pilling and color protection. The bottle design has outstanding on-shelf impact and we expect the launch to receive unprecedented support in this category. Turning then to Latin America, business in Latin America remains strong, despite macroeconomic challenges in some of our larger markets. Market shares increased year-over-year in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, shampoo, bar soaps and liquid cleaners. Our regional toothpaste share increased 120 basis points to almost 76% year-to-date. In Brazil, our share climbed 160 basis points to 73.3% year-to-date, driven by our base businesses, such as anti-cavity and Colgate Triple Action, as well as our premium priced sensitivity business. Our regional manual toothbrush share was up 50 basis points to 41.5% year-to-date. Our regional mouthwash share increased 50 basis points, as well, to 31.2% year-to-date. Brazil, Argentina and Chile all performed well in mouthwash. Brazil's share increased 150 basis points to 34.5%, due to the very successful launch of Plax Ice Infinity. In bar soaps, where our year-to-date share is over 29%, Protex and Palmolive continue to be the number one and two brands across Latin America. Year-to-date, we've reached record shares in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala. In Mexico, innovations such as Palmolive Almond and Omega 3 Oil, supported by impactful shopper marketing programs, continues to drive demand. And we're excited about the upcoming innovation grid for this quarter. In oral care, we'll be launching a complete regimen behind Colgate Sensitive Pro Alivio : toothpaste; manual toothbrush; and mouthwash. And we will offer new, improved graphics across the line. In the Kids' segment, we're launching Colgate Smiles Minions toothpaste, toothbrushes and mouthwash, with the characters kids love. The introduction was timed with the release of the Minions movie across the region. And to continue the momentum in fabric conditioner, we're launching Suavitel Superior Care. Consumers in this region feel that they're constantly washing clothes, making them look worn out too quickly, so this new product conditions each individual fiber to reduce wear-out and extend the life of one's clothes. It will be available in our traditional fragrance as well as a new, unique and sweet vanilla one. Turning then to Asia, business is solid in this region. While overall leadership regional shares in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes have started the year a bit soft, select countries showed good results. As referenced in the earnings press release, toothpaste shares increased in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Philippines and Pakistan. Our manual toothbrush share in India is up 220 basis points to a market-leading 45.7% year-to-date, due, in part, to innovation in the black bristle segment. Innovation launched late in the first quarter and coming in the second quarter should help drive results going forward. In India, we've just launched Colgate Pain Out. Tooth pain is one of the most common dental problems for Indian consumers. And heretofore, there was no targeted solution for the pain, which can come with no warning. Colgate Pain Out is a targeted spot-based application gel that provides express relief from tooth pain. It's been launched in pharmacies across the country and has met with very good early success, while helping to build Colgate's therapeutic equity in the pharmacy channel. The natural segment in India has been growing rapidly. And to capitalize on this, we're revitalizing our Colgate Active Salt toothpaste bundle. This comes in three variants : original, with lemon and neem. And also in this segment, we're launching Colgate Sensitive clove essence toothpaste, which provides long-lasting relief from sensitivity, with the natural essence of clove. For children in India ages two to five, we're introducing a line of toothpastes which are mild and safe and have flavors kids love, strawberry and bubble fruit. In China, we've been relaunching with new graphics and packaging across the toothpaste product portfolio : Colgate 360\u00b0, which reduces bacteria for a 360 degree healthier mouth; Colgate Max Fresh, with a three times freshness shockwave; and Colgate Power White, with a wide range of flavor offerings : dazzling mint, sparkling mint, lemon mineral salt, bamboo charcoal mint and jasmine white tea. In the toothbrush category, in India, we've just introduced the Colgate A1 toothbrush. Now, as you know, in this country of over 1.3 billion people, we have a large opportunity to increase penetration and consumption in the lower income segments. These consumers believe that a toothbrush with a broad, yet compact, head and dense bristles, not only cleans effectively but is also durable and longer-lasting. Colgate A1 meets this need and is priced at an affordable value price point, so this should help us continue to grow our leading manual toothbrush market share. Turning then to Africa/Eurasia, organic sales growth in this region was strong. And, given the 17% currency headwind, the growth came largely from price, as we needed to take significant pricing in certain markets. However, in certain markets, such as Russia, we achieved both pricing and volume growth. Innovation has been instrumental in driving our results, and there's more to come. In the toothpaste whitening category, we're launching Colgate Optic White Lasting White. It's clinically-proven Whiteseal technology makes teeth one shade whiter in one week, while preventing stains and seals-out even tough stains from food and drink. Across Africa, we're introducing a second tier of pricing for the premium Colgate Optic White line, with impactful cracked ice packaging. In the manual toothbrush category, we're launching Colgate Slim Soft Sensitive Gum Care. Developed for the consumer with sensitivity, the brush has ultra-soft bristles and small tuft holes that provide a gentle mouth feel and an ultra-compact head that easily navigates in the mouth. And in the deodorant category in Russia, where we have a solid business, we just launched Lady Speed Stick Bio Protection in March. This line effectively protects against sweat and odor, while also caring for your skin health. The product contains a bio-controlled complex, clinically-proven to provide protection while keeping the skin healthy without irritation. And, as you would expect, it's being supported by in-store shopper support, which should drive good results. Finally, turning to Hill's, Hill's continues to deliver well-balanced mid-single-digit organic sales growth. Business is good domestically and overseas, both in the therapeutic and wellness categories. In the Hill's Prescription Diet line, Metabolic Plus continues to perform well. First launched a year ago, it's now sold in 42 countries. The offering of a complete range of dry food and stews has been supported by extensive sampling and in-clinic seminars and recommendation tools. And, as a result, sales of this product in the first quarter were almost 30% ahead of our expectations. Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight is also meeting with success. In the first quarter, we added Perfect Weight wet in stew form to the existing dry line. As you may recall, this innovation is breakthrough nutrition formulated to help dogs achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Another first quarter introduction was Science Diet Healthy Cuisine, which offers our new alginate technology in our wellness line to deliver superior-looking tasty wet food. This innovation is consistent with the trend of the humanization in pet food. And the launch was supported by end-cap placements in some of the pet superstores, at-shelf signage, on-pack stickers, sampling in store and online support and digital media. Launching this quarter are Hill's Prescription Diet Mobility Treats, great tasting treats that support veterinarians' nutritional recommendation and management of dogs with mobility issues. These are baked treats, such as a pet parent would make at home, and form part of an effective nutritional regimen for dogs eating our Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus Mobility or Prescription Diet j/d therapeutic pet foods. So in summary, we're delighted with our strong start to the year, building on the momentum with which we exited 2015. And as you have heard, we delivered robust organic sales growth, good gross profit margin growth and solid advertising support behind a full range of new products across categories. Our consistent strategies, which you all know well, have yet again stood us in good stead. Colgate people around the world, as always, are working hard to deliver encouraging results, so we look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go through the balance of the year. And, Jessica, that's the end of my prepared remarks. I'd like to turn it over to you to start the Q&A session. Operator : We'll go now to Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me kick it off. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Jason. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Congratulations on the solid start. The volume numbers were obviously very impressive, good to see the snap-back. Also good to see the gross margin progression; on that front, just a quick question for clarification to make sure we understand how to model this in the forward, going through the Q, it looks like the biggest swing factor in the margin progression came at that clubbed line, the group line of cost inflation, FX \u2013 and obviously, you've now added Venezuela deconsolidation in there. We went from a 420 basis point drag to around 130 basis point drag. Can you elaborate on the puts and takes that caused that 290 basis point swing; and ideally, although I'm not sure you're going to answer it, if you could break out the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, okay, Jason, great. And you're right. I'm not going to break out Venezuela. I, frankly, would start by reiterating what Bina said that we are pleased, as you amplified, Jason, with the start to the year. We think it does reflect constancy of strategy and constancy of execution. And pleasingly, the first quarter arrived pretty much as I think we heard described to you it would when we were last on the call, which is to say that our top line would grow between 4% and 7% organically, excluding Venezuela. And 5% was entirely consistent with the fourth quarter. We said that we expected our gross margin to expand between 75 and 125 basis points, and we're very pleased with the 110 and with the increased advertising behind the innovation and all of that flowing through to the bottom line. I guess my comment on the gross profit would be if you look at the shape of our business, gross profit improved across all of our divisions, with the exception of Hill's for a known commodity issue, so it is not limited to Latin America. And across Latin America, we took pretty significant pricing on the back of significant pricing all 2015 to offset further transaction impact, obviously, again, without Venezuela. And we were pleased in Latin America, as we suggested might be the case, that the volume negative that we saw in the fourth quarter rebounded, I think confirming the fact that although there is always a lead lag, we have good consumer loyalty and adoption even at higher price points. So the way I would frame gross margin is we started at the end of the first quarter saying that our gross margin would expand 75 to 125 basis points for a host of reasons, part of which was Venezuela, but our funding-the-growth was an important piece of it as well. And again, 110 [basis points] is pleasing. And as we look forward, I guess we would say we expect our gross margin to continue to improve from the first quarter level over the balance of the year and would now say that for the full year, we expect our gross margin to come in towards the high end of our 75 to 125 basis point range, maybe even slightly ahead of that, depending on where transaction headwinds go. We said the last time that we thought gross margin expansion after the plateau of the last two to three years was an important part of 2016, and clearly that focus remains in the company. And let me just conclude by saying and perhaps giving you the gross profit roll-forward year-on-year, so if you go back to the first quarter of 2015, we had a gross profit margin of 58.9%. We picked up 70 basis points of pricing between restructuring and funding-the-growth, 140 basis points. And, as you know, that tends to build across the year. Material prices, as you say, 130 basis points negative, which is partially underlying commodity prices and does include a little bit of Venezuela. All other, 30 basis points, and so the current year gross profit at 60%. But I think the important point to make is growth between 4% and 7%, excluding Venezuela, starting well at 5% and gross profit starting well at 110 basis points and now saying that we expect to be at the high end of the 75 to 125 [basis point] range, maybe a little bit more. Operator : And we'll go now to Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Wendy. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): That all sounds fantastic. And I don't mean to pick on maybe two tougher markets, but I'm just curious with regard to each of China and India. I know you called those out as strong volume growth markets, but it also looks like market share trends in those two countries are a little bit more challenged. So can you talk about what's going on there? Who you're maybe losing share to, and what your plans are to try to restore your market share momentum? Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Thanks, Wendy. Yeah, I think, as Bina said, market share up nicely in Brazil; interestingly, market share up nicely in Russia. And in fact, a group of us were just in Asia, including India and China, a few weeks ago. And our share start to the year is a little bit softer than history in both cases, I guess. I know we all focus on weekly shares, but I guess just putting both in a slightly longer-term context, if you take China over the last eight years, our share has increased from about 30% to 33%, when our principal multinational competitor has declined from 24% to about 12%. And in India, if you take the same time period, our market share has increased from about 48% to the near 54% that we start the year with; and similarly, our principal multinational competitor is down from 29% to 21%. So we continue to feel very good about the progress over time we are making. In both cases \u2013 let's start with India. In both cases, the short-term share impact comes from local competitors with heightened promotional activity. That is also the case in China. In both cases, we went through the innovation and go-to-market plans that are already being adopted in India and China to take corrective action against that short-term slowdown, and we feel good about making progress over the balance of the year. Operator : We'll go now to Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. I just want to pick up on advertising, if I could, which I think was up in Asia and Latin America, but still down in your other segments, and round about flat as a percentage of sales overall in the quarter. So in that context, could you just update us on where you expect things to land for the full year at the total company level, and call out any key items that we should be cognizant of as we think about the cadence in individual operating segments over the balance of 2016? Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so, we were actually quite pleased with the strong advertising level we had in the first quarter. As Bina said, up meaningfully on the second half of last year and in line with a strong first quarter of 2015, obviously behind a broad and deep array of innovation that we have coming to our markets around the world starting in the first quarter, but, of course, coming for the rest of the year as well. And our current plan would see us increasing our advertising spend year-on-year, both absolutely and as a percentage to sales. That is what we said the last time we spoke and we remain in that position. It would not be a Colgate earnings call if I weren't to emphasis the point that we continue to balance this investment behind our brand health and the innovation we have with the very compelling and broad array of in-store activity that we are able to deploy. And so, in fact, our commercial investment continues to be up as well in the first quarter, which is to say the money that we are investing for in-store activity has increased, and is on top of the increased ratio of spend on traditional advertising versus the fourth quarter of last year. The other thing I would say in terms of efficiency of advertising, because we are seeing it becoming quite a meaningful component of how we go to market a lot more, and we've spent quite a lot of time showcasing this in CAGNY. For those of you that were there or have read the transcript, a lot of our consumer engagement, particularly given the changing demographics in the world, is now with digital advertising. Digital advertising is more efficient than the traditional print, television, radio, billboard type of advertising. And, interestingly, to the point in Asia, a significant part of the investment we make these days, indeed approaching 50% in the case of China, is direct engagement with the consumer through digital vehicles. I call that out simply because it is increasingly the way we engage with consumers, and it's a more effective and efficient way of doing so. Operator : And we'll go next to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Now that FX seems to be turning a bit, how do you think about incremental pricing in emerging markets? Do you stick to the original plan going into the year to keep trying to recover more, because it's obviously still down a lot year-over-year or does this allow you to scale potentially back in terms of your original plans, in some cases? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Olivia, I think \u2013 very good question. I think coming into the year, we were cognizant that while we thought foreign exchange would continue to be a headwind and, of course, it does continue to be headwind, that we would see a little bit of a shift back towards more volume-driven growth and less pricing-driven growth. And indeed, that is the way it has played out in the first quarter. And the first quarter has seen a fairly significant headwind for the average of the quarter in terms of foreign exchange, although, as you rightly say, easing as the quarter ended. So when you look at foreign exchange per se, our current planning sees a lessening of the headwind as the year unfolds, indeed a lessening of the headwind sequentially quarter-by-quarter, which is a good thing. And we will continue to take the pricing that we need to take to offset any transaction impact. But, yes, consistent with the comments we made at the beginning of the year, pricing will be less of a factor in 2016 than it was in 2015. Operator : We'll now take a question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Ali. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, how are you? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So first, just a clarification on the share; so how much was actually the share down in China this quarter, because it sounds like that was probably the biggest driver of your roughly 140 basis point share decline year-on-year? And then secondly, how much of your company-wide organic sales growth came from any products sold into Venezuela? I understand deconsolidation, but you said that you might still sell some product in and that might be counter to get U.S. dollars out. So is there any there? And I ask not just for top line, but also because on EPS, I mean, clearly, your dollar EPS expectations are a little bit higher for the year, which is good, and I'm trying to understand the drivers of that. Is that FX-driven? Is it fundamental-driven or is that kind of $0.10 you had talked about last quarter of an impact from Venezuela, are you getting any relief there because you're actually now pleasingly able to sell products into Venezuela that you weren't before? Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, again, I can't resist. Thank you for the one question. First, to answer your two Venezuela questions, as clearly as one can, the answer is zero in both cases. I'm not sure there's much to add to amplify on the EPS. The EPS flat guidance that we provided is entirely driven by the spot change in foreign exchange. So the answer to those two questions, Ali, I think are that simple. Share is a more a complicated answer, and I will give you the data you request, but a few things to say. First of all, obviously, we took out Venezuela year-on-year. Secondly, without dwelling on it, foreign exchange plays a role in the aggregation of share. And thirdly, our volume shares continue to perform quite nicely. In terms of China, the short-term share impact, and we only have the first two months of the year, so it's a year-on-year comparison, is down a share point, one, down to 33% from approaching 34%. And in the case of India, it is less than that. Operator : We'll now take a question from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Bill. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Ian, I know we've at least alluded to 60% gross margin for, jeez, a decade now, and just kind of as you look out, and I know you're not giving guidance, but is there a natural ceiling you see to gross margin over the next few years? I mean, are we getting to that point where it can only get 65%-ish is as far as it can go? I mean, how do you look at that as we go further, kind of (35:04) the next 10 years? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it's kind of like market share, Bill, I guess. 105%, we'd probably have to stop, but I'm glad you asked the question because it is a milestone, as we said in the release. Unfortunately, the severe foreign exchange transaction headwinds have prevented us realizing that ambition over the last several years. So, again, we feel very good about the 60%. To repeat what I said a little bit earlier, we think we will be at the high end of the 75 to 125 [basis point] range for this year, maybe a bit beyond. And you're absolutely right. Our next goal is 65%. And I suggest we revisit the conversation when we get to 65%. It is interesting as you begin to reorganize us the way we are and aggregate so much of what we do. For people who are very focused, it tends to reveal more opportunities in areas that perhaps haven't been as fully exploited for efficiency than we had before. So we retain the ambition for 65%. And I'm sure when we get to 65%, we will have more ambition. Operator : We'll go now to Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Dara. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So your pricing results in North America and Europe were down 2% and 3% year-over-year, respectively. So I was just hoping you could review what's driving the pricing pressure in the developed markets, the competitive environment you're seeing in developed markets, and also maybe some emerging markets commentary; you talked about India and China, but, beyond those markets, what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint where the pricing's been much stronger? Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Well, Europe is not new news, Dara, and is consistent with prior year, frankly, slightly better than prior year. We have talked. Let's start with the consumer. We've talked about the category environments in the geographies around the world, where the growth of categories \u2013 I'm now talking our categories \u2013 is somewhat muted in the 0% to 2% range in the U.S. We're now sort of in the 2% to 3% range, edging towards the 3%, and, despite all of the headlines quite broadly across the emerging markets, still running mid-single digits on a local currency basis. So the marketplace promotional intensity, not tracing to any particular competitor, is as it has been in Europe. There's really nothing new there. We continue to operate very well in that environment, as Bina mentioned, with our market share progress. And I think that's very healthy. So that's the way I'd answer that. North America, there is always a component in North America, when you remember that the couponing for the trial of new products is covered in the trade spending. That is a factor in North America. And so, as we have heightened innovation activity, you will see more of the trial-generating couponing, which translates through into price. And in both cases, as the year unfolds, we are expecting that negative pricing to ameliorate somewhat. Pleasingly, of course, gross margins, in both the case of North America and Europe, were up for the quarter, and we expect them to be up for the year as well. So as we think about our marketing mix and where we make our investments, you look at the share. You look at the gross margin progress. You look at the top line progress. We think we're managing that balance in a responsible way. Operator : We'll now take a question from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone, Bina, Ian. On the volume... Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Javier. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Hello. How are you? On the volume rebound, particularly in Latin America, if you can help us understand more about how much is passing over the sticker shock of the price increases, or there was any either market improvement, or any change in inventory, destocking or restocking, that could have explained the rebound in volume. Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Javier, very good question. The answer is on the inventory side, if you go back to the inventory events in China and Brazil sometime back, I think we were one of the first companies to come forward and describe what was going on in the marketplace. We have a very tight control on the distributors and the wholesalers that we use in these markets to bring inventory to the consumer. So there is, in these numbers, no destocking, refilling of inventory. These are true volume numbers in Latin America, and we feel good about that. We do think, and this is what we try to intimate on the fourth quarter, when people were a little bit concerned and probing on the negative volume in Latin America, that there would be a little bit of a lag, given the significant pricing we took in the fourth quarter, for volume to bounce back. But I think we were quite clear that we did expect 2016 to be a year where our organic would shade more to the volume than to the pricing. So that's what I think we are seeing in Latin America, and I think the market share story makes its own case in terms of the consumer consumption of our products. Operator : And we'll go now to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Ian, good morning. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Bill. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I'm going to try and sneak in two, if I can. So the first question is do you think the worst is over in emerging markets? I know you were pretty cautious on Brazil at CAGNY. Has anything changed in that view? And then, my other question is, can you just talk about the competitive dynamics in premium pet food, especially in the U.S., because it seems like a lot of bigger multinationals now are buying some of these wholesome natural competitors and we keep hearing rumblings about increased distribution there and new product launches and things like that? So any particular thoughts you'd like to share, I'd appreciate. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Have you got a cold? William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I do have a little bit of a cold. Yeah. Thanks for asking. Yeah. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Listen, to say do you think the worst is over on emerging markets is the classic famous last words statement. So I guess what I would say by way of answer is that what we continue to see in our categories is mid-single digits growth. I have to say, having just returned from Latin America and India and China, the consumer that you see on the ground, the behavior that you see on the ground, is really quite vibrant in India; and in China, is not doom and gloom, some concerns, but not the headlines that we read every day. Conversely, in Russia and Brazil, the consumer sentiment, as we have said before, is more negative. So I think the way we are thinking about it is more in terms of the consumers' consumption behavior, as we measure it in those markets, and that seems to suggest that we will be going forward with categories growing, in general terms, mid-single digits on a local currency basis. Pet food, we like the market. We have always been premium. With Prescription, obviously, we get the benefit of reversing a disease condition, with a clinically-proven product with a vet's recommendation. And, as you know, the emotional attachment pet owners have with their pets is quite extraordinary. If one comes back in life, one might want to be a pet. So and I think the offerings that we have as a company position us well in the U.S. marketplace. And, as Bina said, our business is healthy internationally, and it's also very healthy in the U.S. And I think our point of competition, as we have tried to repeat as time passes, is we now have an innovation stream on this business that we think is relevant to the consumer, and, from a pricing point of view, is seen as value. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll now go to John Faucher with JPMorgan. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on Bill's question a little bit more, but looking sort of at M&A strategy more broadly. You're coming out of a couple of years with a lot of macroeconomic volatility, FX; you're back to the gross margin going up again. Does this give you a little bit more confidence in the underlying business, which maybe could allow you to take a little bit greater look at your portfolio, either in terms of cleaning up some assets or potentially looking to buy, if there's anything that isn't overly expensive at this point? Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thanks, John. First of all, without sounding Pollyanna, I'm not sure we ever lost confidence in the underlying business. Obviously, the moves we're seeing on foreign exchange, from a dollar point of view, are more favorable, but I think I would always also say from an M&A point of view, our view also has never changed. We are very strategic in this space, as you know. We have interest in oral pet and personal. We have, obviously, a great deal of knowledge about assets that might be available around the world. And to the extent that they would go to auction or might be preemptively available, we would certainly pursue that, if we thought it would strengthen our company or strengthen our category or strengthen a particular geography. And although it's not a very visible part of what we do, we do dedicate time and resources to that space. More than that, I really can't say. In terms of divestment, the only thing I would really say, the last big thing we did, of course, was the divestment of our Australasian business, which now leaves us with virtually no laundry detergents. And that's probably the last scale divestment we have done and probably would be doing. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Operator : We'll now go to Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Good morning. Thanks a lot. Hey, I know China is not an enormous market relative to everything else you do, but I did want to go back to that. Just to ask about \u2013 we're definitely picking up increased promotional activity from local competitors. Also, it sounds like maybe their innovation capability is improving. Ian, could you talk about whether being such a big online market \u2013 I know it's not a big percentage of your sales now, but in many other categories online is growing like crazy \u2013 is this making a pricing environment that's more difficult? Is it leading to more local competition gaining share? And did you actually lose share on the Darlie brand or was that all on the Colgate brand? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It was a little bit of both in terms of the share loss. It has nothing to do with digital, although I will come back to digital. It is the plethora of local brands, which tends to be more brick-and-mortar activity with promoters in-store, who essentially rugby-tackle you when you walk into the store in order to persuade you. I would say it's not particularly innovation-driven for the plethora of local brands. There is one local competitor, Unimbyall (48:26) that does a good job at a premium price point. We've made the point before that we have innovation and R&D capability on the ground. We have just moved to the marketplace with a new natural line, which is very tailored to the Chinese consumer. We have advertising that is very different to the advertising that we use around the world, in terms of engaging with the Chinese consumer. Now, coming back to the Internet, we see this as an enormous opportunity in China. You're right, it is a relatively low percentage of sales in the categories in which we do business. Our business has been booming over the last three years. We have been growing market share, but we spent a lot of time when we were in Asia, particularly in China, addressing this topic and we see Internet \u2013 you think of the Tencent's and the Alibaba's, we see Internet as a very rich area for future growth in China for us. But that is separate and apart from the sort of brick-and-mortar price promotion of the plethora of cheapy brands. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Erin Lash with Morningstar. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thank you for taking my question. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail regarding Brazil. Obviously, your share gains in the quarter were quite pronounced. We've heard from a lot of other consumer product companies that the competitive and macro landscape is extremely challenging and you are obviously able to withstand those challenges. So any additional details you can provide in how you've been operating and continue to operate so well in that market would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Erin. Yeah, Latin America is a very changeable economic arena in our world. And you can go back to the 1980s, and have seen many companies be hurt by economic events and perhaps reduce focus on Latin America, or even withdraw from Latin America. We, at that time, stayed. And we learned how to operate in these volatile environments. And frankly, a lot of it starts with pricing to make sure you have a margin that allows you to invest to grow a brand. I think if you come to Brazil, the position we have with a 74% share in toothpaste, leadership share in toothbrushes, and jockeying for leadership in mouth rinse, Colgate is an enormously well-trusted brand in Brazil. And we bring significant innovation to the Brazilian marketplace; interestingly, innovation that is not necessarily cheap, but which the consumer sees value in. We're also very disciplined in terms of our go-to-market. To the question asked earlier, we make sure that we bring to the marketplace the volume of product that the consumer is purchasing, so we don't create an inventory dislocation that you then have to unwind. So the combination of all of that has seen the share grow, and, indeed, quite pleasingly, volume grow as well. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thank you. Operator : We'll now take a question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Lauren. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Just talk a little bit about, actually, with the competitive pricing environment, particularly in emerging markets, I was wondering if as you're looking out over the next couple of quarters and recognizing there will soon be some local inflation that you'll be trying to price and stop as you can, do you get the sense that any of your competitors are perhaps a bit more price-constrained; they sort of price to a prior peak of inflation, so there'd be sort of different dynamics in how you're approaching pricing in the next couple of quarters versus some of your competitors? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I guess our experience on pricing in the categories where we lead pricing is that sometimes we see a lead lag between the competitor taking pricing, be they international or local, remembering a lot of raw materials are dollar dominated, so whether you're multinational or local, you're going to get the impact eventually, but then, what you see is over time, the pricing in the marketplace move up. So I would say the general experience is you have to be a little bit patient sometimes, but eventually, the patience sees the market rise. There is certainly in those markets no retailer resistance, because they understand the concept of translation-driven inflation very well, to the transaction inflation very well. To the extent the transaction is not as significant as it has been in 2015, as I said earlier, our expectation is that we will be taking lesser pricing this year than last, but over half of the pricing we came into 2016 with was rollover pricing, even excluding Venezuela. So I would say that's the way to profile it. Interestingly, if you focus your innovation on bringing benefits, think of whitening as we have done, you can actually charge a meaningful premium price in a category, lift the category and bring the consumer with you. And obviously, I think it's the duty of marketing companies to find those consumer needs that you can really deliver against at a price point wherein they see value. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks so much. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Lauren. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. And morning, everybody. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Mark. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Two quick sort of related questions to one another and I think they pertain to Venezuela, so I'm hoping you'll give some direction on that. How much, or how should we think about the impact, probably is the better way to phrase it, from Venezuela deconsolidation in gross margin? And then, the other sort of related question from an interest expense net standpoint, is the biggest delta relative to last year the amount of cash that you're not accounting for in Venezuela any more of the interest being earned on that or is it somewhere else? But I guess sort of the net-net is interest expense then first quarter trend through the year more realistic than what the rate was last year? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So to take your first question, I think the way we should think about it is that our gross margin will expand this year at the upper end of our 75 to 125 basis point range and that is excluding Venezuela, as you well know. And indeed, it may be slightly higher than that level. As I think we demonstrated in the first quarter, our gross margin expansion is broader than Latin America, and we expect that to be the case going forward. And that's the way we should think about it. We should also come back to the top line and repeat that without Venezuela, we are still saying we expect our top line to increase in that 4% to 7% range excluding Venezuela, and 5% was a good start. When you turn to interest income and the recording of that, I guess what we're looking at here is that the interest income will be down, but net-net, the range of interest we will be paying will be in the $30 million to $35 million a quarter range, which is up on prior year. Okay. I take silence to mean we have reached a conclusion, Jessica. Operator : That is correct. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Well, thanks. Thanks for joining the call. Thank you for your questions. Thank you for your interest. And thank you to all the Colgate people that make this happen. And we look forward to updating you on our second quarter progress later in the year. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's Colgate-Palmolive Company's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and the most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables eight and nine of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Bina Thompson. Please go ahead, Bina. Bina H. Thompson - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Angela. And good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings release conference call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. Happily, the momentum we saw in the first quarter continued into the second quarter with good organic sales growth, within our targeted range of four to seven percent, and as compared to the strongest quarter of last year. Gross profit margin accelerated nicely, which allowed us to increase worldwide advertising as a percent to sales. And as you will hear in more detail, our market shares are strong. New products continue to play an important role in our strategy. Innovation across categories has helped fuel growth around the world. And our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track. Our balance sheet is strong and so is our cash generation. We continue to be faced with macroeconomic challenges in many parts of the world, coupled with ongoing and sometimes volatile currency headwinds. So in light of this, we are particularly pleased with the results. Just a quick housekeeping note before we get into the divisions. As was mentioned in this morning's 8-K filing, as a result of management changes effective April 1, 2016, the company realigned the geographic structure of its Europe/South Pacific and Asia operating segments. Beginning this quarter, the results of the South Pacific operations are reported in the Asia Pacific operating segment. There is no impact on historical company results overall. For informational purposes, recast historical geographic segment and geographic sales growth information conforming to the new reporting structure has been provided within this morning's 8-K and the For Investors section of Colgate's website at www.colgatepalmolive.com. So now let's turn to the divisions. Starting with North America. We are pleased with another solid quarter in North America. Our U.S. and Canada businesses, including our Tom's of Maine and professional businesses, contributed to good growth. Innovation across categories helped drive market shares and, as referenced in the press release, market shares increased on a year-to-date basis in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, liquid hand soap, body wash, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners. Our oral care franchises are strong. In toothpaste, our leadership position year-to-date through June of 35.7% has increased to 35.8% in the latest read. New products supported by impactful marketing campaigns and in-store activity have been critical to this success. Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste, our most recent addition to the Colgate Total equity, is driving growth in the super premium segment, with year-to-date shares increasing from 3.7% in 2015 to 4.3% in 2016, increasing our overall Colgate Total share by 60 basis points. In addition to equity drivers such as engaging media and in-store and online support in the second quarter, we linked Colgate Total to National Women's Health Week. Colgate Optic White is performing well with a full portfolio including multiple toothpaste offerings as well as whitening toothbrushes and mouthwash for a complete regimen approach. Adding to the basic Optic White, Optic White Platinum Express White and Optic White Platinum Lasting White variants was the recent launch of Optic White Platinum High Impact White toothpaste. Our overall Optic White toothpaste share is at 6.3% year-to-date, and in the second quarter reached 6.6%, up 80 basis points from the year-ago period. Colgate 360\u00b0 Toothbrush continues to deliver differentiated and incremental innovation. In the first quarter we launched Colgate 360\u00b0 Enamel Health Whitening toothbrush with spiral polishing bristles and stain erasing cups. Market share for the Colgate 360\u00b0 toothbrush range has grown from 13.1% in 2011 to 19.8% in 2015 and is up again this year, achieving 22.1% through June. Continuing the momentum for the Colgate 360\u00b0 franchise, shipping this month in the U.S. is the new Colgate 360\u00b0 Total Advanced 4 Zone manual toothbrush. This revolutionary new toothbrush features a high-tech, ergonomic design, and a tongue and cheek cleaner with longer rubber nubs than any previous Colgate 360\u00b0 toothbrush. It's specifically designed to clean the four zones of your mouth : your teeth, tongue, cheeks and gums. This launch is being supported via comprehensive shopper activation in key retailers. And in personal care, innovation in both liquid hand soap and body wash have driven share increases. In the first quarter we launched Softsoap Pure Foaming Hand Soap. The simple, gentle formula cleans and purifies and has 100% natural fragrance with no dye or alcohol. And we told you last quarter about Softsoap Luminous Oils body wash which comes in two variants : avocado oil and iris, and macadamia oil and peony. This new line has been incremental to our overall body wash share, and the macadamia oil and peony variant has been the number one Softsoap body wash variant at a major U.S. retailer for 13 out of the last 15 weeks. Let's turn to Europe. Despite continued macroeconomic uncertainties across the region, Europe delivered another quarter of positive organic sales growth. Toothpaste market shares remained relatively stable at 35.2% across the region. And we enjoyed market share increases in manual and battery toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap and fabric conditioners. While toothpaste share was relatively stable across the region, we saw some good increases in individual countries as referenced in the press release, with strength in both the Colgate and GABA brands. Now, you may recall we told you last quarter about the rollout of our toothbrush plus whitening pen which has met with great success. Our regional overall manual toothbrush share is at 27% year-to-date, up 250 basis points from the year-ago period and over 10 share points ahead of the nearest competitor. In France, one of the first launch markets to launch the toothbrush plus whitening pen, our overall year-to-date toothbrush share has gone to 25.5% from 18.2% in the year-ago period. Our year-to-date body wash share is up 40 basis points from 12.7% to 13.1%, with gains coming from both the Palmolive and Sanex brands. You will recall we recently launched a range of Sanex products, including body wash, for dry and atopic skin. And in the bigger Sanex markets - France, Spain and the UK \u2013 our overall body wash shares increased 100 basis points, 140 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively, year-to-date. Our fabric conditioner share year-to-date increased 150 basis points across the region from 23.3% to 24.8%. And our largest market, France, saw growth of over a point from 47.4% to 48.5%, with the most recent read at 50.1%, and this in the face of continued stiff competitive activity. More innovation is planned for the back half of this year. And as in other parts of the world, the toothpaste whitening segment is strong and growing at almost twice the rate of the overall toothpaste category. We lead in this segment with a 43% year-to-date share. So, to capitalize on the growth opportunity, we are relaunching Colgate Max White Optic with revitalized graphics and an improved formula which is three times more powerful for instantly and visibly whiter teeth. A new GABA product is meridol Parodont Expert, a clinically-proven daily-use toothpaste which increases gum resistance against periodontitis. This offering fills a gap in our portfolio. And in personal care, we hope to continue the momentum in body wash with the launch of Palmolive Gourmet Spa, a unique concept which has been proven in other geographies. And as I'm sure you recall, this range of body washes has a high density creamy formula offered in Vanilla Pleasure, Chocolate Passion, Peach Delight and Strawberry Touch. New sleeve packaging provides a premium look, high quality satin finishing, extended communication surface and strong shelf impact. Sanex is now launching Sanex Men, a unique positioning for the mass market, as it is the first range of products, body washes, shampoo and underarm protection, which is truly focused on men's skin health. Turning then to Latin America, the strong organic sales growth of the first quarter continued into the second quarter. And, as you would expect, innovation contributed to these results across categories. In toothpaste, our regional share year-to-date is up 80 basis points to a record 75.5%. In Brazil, our share is at a record 73.3%, with the most recent read at 73.5%. In the highly competitive whitening category, our Colgate Luminous White equity is doing well. The complete regimen offering of toothpaste, manual toothbrush, toothbrush plus whitening pen and mouthwash has been supported by a new and strong marketing campaign, Designed to Make You Shine. In Mexico, where our overall toothpaste share is back over 80%, Colgate Luminous White toothpaste has achieved a record 9.1% share year-to-date, up 60 basis points over the year-ago period. Our regional mouthwash share is also strong, up 30 basis points to 31.5% year-to-date. In Brazil, the launch of Colgate Plax Ice Infinity has met with exceptional results and driven our share up 170 basis points year-to-date to 35.2%. In the personal care category in Brazil we launched Protex Pro-Hidrata with macadamia oil, a line of bar soap, body wash and liquid hand soap offering moisturizing sensation as well as the antibacterial protection for which Protex is known. The bundle is incremental to the Protex equity, driving the Protex body cleansing share from 13.6% in December of 2015 to 14.6% in the most recent period, further establishing Protex as the leading antibacterial body cleansing equity in Brazil. Our new product flow is continuing in the second half of the year. Launching now are two new toothpastes. The first, priced at the premium range of the category, Colgate Total Professional Daily Repair, creates a shield in 100% of the mouth surfaces that helps repair early enamel demineralization and prevent teeth and gum problems. The second, Colgate Triple Action Extra Whitening, should help drive share in the base business. Its exclusive formula with micro polishing particles provides extra whitening, it removes stains, works from the first brushing and restores the teeth's natural whiteness. Along with the Triple Action toothpaste will be a companion Colgate Triple Action Whitening toothbrush. To further build on our momentum with Protex, we are continuing the launch of Protex for Men 3 in 1. The product, which comes in liquid or bar soap form, delivers three benefits. Besides eliminating 99.9% of bacteria, it actively cleans the body without drying out the skin, it prepares the skin for a soft shave and it can be used as a shampoo leaving men's hair clean with a masculine fragrance. Turning then to Asia/South Pacific. Results were somewhat muted in the region in this quarter on an overall basis with pockets of strength. For instance, in the Philippines, our toothpaste share increased over 200 basis points year-to-date to 62.6%, with the most recent read at 64.6%. Lower priced offerings such as Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Fresh Confidence as well as premium priced Colgate Sensitive contributed to the share gains. And to continue the momentum, we are in the process of introducing Colgate Fresh Confidence Bamboo Charcoal toothpaste in that market. In India, our manual toothbrush share is up 200 basis points year-to-date to 45.7%. Colgate Zig Zag Black has contributed to the share gain. And as you would expect, we have more innovation slated for the balance of the year. In India, the consumer believes strongly in natural ingredients, and we told you last quarter about two toothpaste initiatives, Colgate Active Salt with Neem and Colgate Sensitive with Clove Essence. A third toothpaste launching this quarter under the Cibaca sub-brand is Colgate Cibaca Vedshakti. The positioning is a toothpaste packed with the goodness of natural ingredients to help keep dental problems away. In the toothbrush category, we are launching Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal Spiral. Charcoal toothbrushes have been particularly successful in this region, and this latest brush offers spiral bristles with charcoal. Mouthwash is a small but growing category across the region. Our regional share is up year-to-date by 30 basis points to a record 28%. And to continue the momentum, this quarter in India we are launching Colgate Plax Spicy Fresh, delivering spicy freshness without the burn. Turning then to Africa/Eurasia. Our business across the region remains solid despite macroeconomic challenges and continued currency headwinds. Our toothpaste market shares are strong. In Russia, our share is up 120 basis points year-to-date to 34.9%. Much of the growth has come from our mainstream businesses Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Maximum Cavity protection. In Turkey, our share is around the prior year-to-date level at 26.8% but in the most recent period our share is at 28.1%. And in South Africa, our year-to-date share is at 50.4%, up 10 basis points, with the most recent read at 50.6%. In South Africa, our manual toothbrush share is up 60 basis points to 38.6% year-to-date, with the most recent read at 39.2%. Now, we've told you before about Colgate Total Pro Breath Health toothpaste, first launched in Latin America. This toothpaste with a new formula with ON 12 (15:34) complex that neutralizes bad breath bacteria while protecting 100% of the surfaces of the mouth will be rolled out across this region, supported by media and key visuals in store to communicate the benefits. Similarly drawing from other regions, we will be launching Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent toothpaste, formulated to repair the cause of sensitivity and prevent further sensitivity from gum recession. A product developed for the Russian market is our new Colgate Altai Herbs Ginseng, which adds Ginseng, a natural healing ingredient, to the Colgate Altai Herbs toothpaste launched previously. In the personal care category, we are relaunching our Palmolive Gourmet Spa line of shower gels with improved graphics. And in addition, we have added two new variants, mint and coconut. Turning to Hill's. As with the Colgate businesses, Hill's continues with solid results fueled by successful innovation. Launched now over a year ago, Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus continues to deliver outstanding performance. The complete range of dry and stews has been rapidly distributed across all regions and is now selling in 46 countries. Building on the solid Metabolic Plus platform, in May of this year we launched Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus Urinary Stress for cats with clinically proven nutrition for concurrent conditions of obesity and feline lower urinary tract disease. This launch was integrated into an overall focus on urinary problems which are very common in cats. The product is now available in thirteen countries across North America and Europe. Dermatological disorders and skin issues represent the fourth largest therapeutic food category in dollar sales for pets. In 2016 we have two major initiatives in this area : Prescription Diet Derm Defense and an upgrade of our Prescription Diet z/d. Prescription Diet Derm Defense is Hill's first and only nutrition with HistaGuard Complex, formulated to reduce signs of environmental allergy by disrupting the internal allergy response and creating a barrier against future episodes in dogs. It is now in the U.S. and Europe and will be rolled out across the rest of the world. The science was presented both at a Global Derm Symposium in April in California and at the World Congress of Veterinary Dermatology in May in France, driving awareness among key thought-leaders. Our Prescription Diet z/d upgrade has been reformulated to increase ingredients known to support skin and coat and GI health. And in addition, we launched a small bites variant for the rapidly growing small dog population. Innovations across our Science Diet platform continue to do well. In addition to our Science Diet Perfect Weight and Science Diet Healthy Cuisine, which we told you about last quarter, our Science Diet Urinary Hairball Control for cats is exceeding original sales estimates in North America. It's now the number one wet variant for Science Diet. In Europe we have an online quiz and game as well as videos for the product to generate interest and trial. So in summary then, we are very pleased with how the year is progressing. Our organic sales growth is solid and our savings programs as well as our Global Growth and Efficiency Program are delivering a healthy gross profit margin increase. Around the world Colgate people are executing our focused strategies. Our innovation pipeline is full and we're excited about what is yet to come. So we look forward to sharing our results with you as we go through the balance of the year. And now, Angela, I should like to turn it over to questions. Operator : Thank you. Today's questions-and-answer session will be conducted electronically for the telephone audience. And we will take our first question from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Wendy. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I don't think I heard, Bina, you comment on China, even though in the press release you mentioned volume declines. So could you talk about the magnitude of the volume declines in China, what the pricing environment was like? And maybe a broader question of kind of what's going on, is it to your market share? I know Procter has talked about the need to more premiumize the oral care category. Do you share that view? So sort of a specific on the quarter, how did China fare? And bigger picture, what's your take on China right now? Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks for the question, Wendy. I guess overall I would start a little bit further back and say that in balancing all of the geographies and the headwinds we are facing in the world, we were delighted to post an overall 4.5% organic growth. Asia, as you saw, was more muted at 2% although with some highlights, as Bina has already discussed. I don't think based on what you have heard over the last couple of weeks from other companies that operate in China that there are some short-term issues in that geography. So let me explain our analysis of what's going on, which we view as a relatively short-term issue as I will describe, and then I can come back and talk about market shares both overall and respective to China. So first of all, in terms of what's going on in the marketplace, two things. Number one, as we entered the second quarter, the consumer consumption slowed quite sharply. It picked back up and as we look forward, we think that the consumer consumption in China for the balance of the year will continue to be around mid-single digits. But there was a slowdown entering the second quarter. That was compounded by a fairly large structural change that's going on in China, which is this shift of business from brick and mortar to online. Online's showing very sharp growth, indeed our online business doubled year-to-date in China. And both of those things saw inventory build with the wholesalers, in part because of backdoor selling from the brick and mortar retailers which distorted pricing in the market and built inventory with wholesalers. Now, we have seen that before, as you know, and we are seeing it again and we are in the process of dealing with that inventory situation. And we think, as it was the last time, it will be fully corrected by the time we get to the fourth quarter of this year but it will continue for a little while. In terms of market share, we talked on the last call about market share in China. I would comment first on the world and I would say on the world that our market share in dollar terms, which is what we comment on in the press release, is modestly down. But that is all to do with foreign exchange mix. In fact, our market share on a constant currency basis is up, and our market share in volume terms is up around the world. In China, our market share is beginning to recover in the second quarter, showing two periods of uptrend as the innovation that we spoke about the last time, which is premium innovation to your point, Wendy, is beginning to take hold in the marketplace. So we don't think we're imbalanced from a portfolio point of view. The primary local competitor that we spoke about, Unimbyall (24:19), has been flat in market share terms for the past six periods. And we think our innovation flow is good. So for our business, based on the analysis we see, it is this temporal adjustment again of slowdown in consumption which has picked back up, but perhaps a more substantive shift over time move from brick and mortar to e-commerce. Again, if the consumption is mid-single digits, we will simply grow our business where consumers do their shopping. The consumption levels will not change. So something to work through, but we don't think substantive. And we certainly don't think that we have a portfolio issue as we go forward. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I know you've commented in the past that you're kind of agnostic, at least in developed markets, about selling to brick and mortar versus online retailers. Does that apply as well to China or is there a margin difference between where you're selling? Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We're agnostic. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks. Operator : We will now go to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Ali. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Want to drill a little bit into Latin America. And so, look, it's more than half of your emerging market business right now. So at about kind of 9.5% pricing that you took from that region, that's driving about 80%-ish, three-quarters, 80%-ish of your emerging market, 6.5% growth you mention in the release. And to be clear, you're not unique in that reliance among the companies that we cover. But I want to get a sense of the sustainability you see in that, especially as we saw some of your Brazil volumes get a little bit worse lately sequentially here. We see that Latin America is the only region, at least from the press release, that you increased ad spend on. Mexico is left out of share gaining. Kind of the list of countries, Mexico's left out after Latin America. So I want to get a sense of you about the sustainability of driving so much of your growth from that region. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Well, we're quite optimistic on Latin America, which may be a contrarian thing to say, largely based on the relationship we have with the consumers that buy our products. Now, the Mexican market share is still north of 80%, which is a fairly respectable place to be, and we quoted the Brazilian share at now approaching 74%. I actually wouldn't use the term relying on pricing in Latin America. I would more say that we have the elasticity to take the pricing with our consumer in order to offset the translation impact of costs driven by weakening foreign exchange. You know well from our history that while we see volume slow down as the pricing goes through, that that comes back over time. And our forward thinking on Latin America is that the volume negative will dissipate across the back half of the year. And the important thing for us is to watch our market shares and, as I said earlier, our market shares are not only up country by country, but they're up on a volume basis as well. So people are staying with our product. If we don't face the headwind in costs, as we said coming into this year, you would see our forward business momentum be more volume driven than pricing driven. And indeed we still stand behind the comment that for this year, as we deliver within the 4% to 7% range that we are staying with, it will be more volume driven than pricing driven for the entire year. So it is a response to the headwinds that we face to help generate the kind of gross margin expansion that you are seeing which allows us to continue to lift our traditional advertising, which I know you favor, and at the same time continue with the in-store work that we also believe engages with consumers. So we're very comfortable with our approach, and that comfort is based entirely on the enduring relationship we have with the consumers that buy our products in that part of the world. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: This was helpful. And the enduring relationship with consumers in that part of the world, it seems like you want to increase that through incremental advertising spend there but nowhere else, so in none of the other regions you see ad spend goes up, as far as I could tell, except for that region. So I'm trying to get a better sense of that. And if you might be able to just give a little bit more granularity on Brazil. So are people trading down? What do you see happening now? We've heard some people saying it's bottoming. Just some perspective there. Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Well, as usual, thanks for the one question. On Brazil, I think we take the view, as many others have announced, that we see this continuing for the balance of the year. We have not seen trading down in terms of our portfolio. Indeed, we did not see that, you will remember, during the subprime period. And if consumers find themselves cash stretched, they tend to buy a smaller size before they come back to the payday weekend. So I would venture to say more continued turbulence in Brazil for the balance of the year. We have long said that we did not think this would be a short fix. Again, our category growth rates continue in that mid-single digit range. Yes, largely driven by pricing at this time. But these foreign exchanges trends will eventually change. So that would be Brazil. And in terms of the advertising, Ali, I think you have to watch our planning over a year rather than drill in to one geography in one quarter. We stand by what we say, which is that we are planning for our advertising for the full year to be up both absolutely and as a percentage to sales, and we will see how that unfolds over the balance of the year. Frankly again, even though this may continue to be contrarian, in some parts of the world where the consumers are particularly stressed, we are finding that the in-store efforts produce a better result with good brand scores and a good ROI. And we will continue to do that in a balanced way to build our brands. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : We'll now go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Just for clarification, is your share online in key markets similar to what we can see in brick and mortars, or are there markets where there are disconnects? And then just in terms of price mix, following up on that, the price versus volume contribution obviously is still on back to price being a bigger contributor versus volume. So first, does mix have any impact in there? And then just sort of your thoughts on the second half in terms of the dynamic. I know volume a bigger piece than price over time, but just a clarification on that second half expectation. Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, the online is interesting because what you see online often is that the share composition is very different. So for example in the U.S., we are the brand share leader online but, for example, our Tom's of Maine business has a disproportionately elevated share online which may trace to the demographics of the consumer. So you see our shares profiling strongly, but sometimes the composition of those shares is very, very different to what you would see in a brick and mortar account. Relative to this pricing notion, I mean, our price was greater than our volume in this, the second quarter for the reasons that I have mentioned. You will remember our volume is a dollar weighted volume, so mix is not a factor in the discussion. And to repeat what we said to Ali, it is our planning that for this year in total, our growth, which will be within the 4% to 7% range we have been guiding will be more driven towards volume than price on a relative basis to last year. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. If could follow up on developed markets pricing, it's been pretty negative in developed markets, and in the case of the U.S. it's got more negative versus last year. And your main competitor seems to have a bit more of a sense of urgency in other categories. So what are you seeing on the competitive front that's causing you to keep promotional levels heightened like this? Thank you again. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I'm not sure the pricing situation in Europe is unique to us. If you talk about North America, oftentimes this traces here to the couponing that you use to put behind your new innovations. So we all have our thoughts and plans in terms of innovation flows, which vary by company, but our pricing in North America, we think overall, we get a good organic growth out of it. So it really does trace more to the innovation flow and the couponing that builds trial behind that innovation flow. Hello? Operator : With no other questions from Ms. Tong, we will now go to Bill Chappell with SunTrust. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Bill. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, Ian, just kind of a simple question. On share repurchase, just looking back, your average share count went down sequentially every quarter from 2006 until 2015, yet it's gone actually up for the first time both in 1Q and 2Q. So is there a change in thought of use of cash or share repurchase, or it's just more of a short-term event? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, there is not a change. We simply got behind ourselves. So for the year we are still talking about a gross buyback of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. We fell behind, frankly, in the second quarter which is the net result of what you see. Therefore, what you're going to see over the balance of the year is that share repurchase pick up. And on a gross basis, it's going to be between $300 million and $400 million a quarter so that we realize the $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion range for the full year. So we're still holding to the full year and, therefore, there will be an uptick in the second half of the year to compensate. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And that's reflected I guess in the share count on the outlook. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Exactly. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll now go to Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thanks very much for the question. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Is it John or Jonathan? Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : It's Jonathan. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : It's Jonathan. You can call me either, Ian. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Fine. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : When you think about pricing and volume, particularly in Latin America where you have such strong market shares, has anything \u2013 it strikes me as a conundrum companies like yourselves face that just at the time when consumers are feeling some distress in other areas from the currency movement, you're asking them to pay more for the products. Assuming a more neutral currency situation in the future, how much pricing opportunity of the pricing that's happening today is increased value add, increased value you're bringing to the consumer? And how much of it do you think that lasts into a more neutral currency environment, should we ever experience one again? But hopefully at some point in the next year or two. Thanks very much. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, thanks, Jonathan. Latin America is an interesting part of the world. The shopping consumer in Latin America is perhaps one of most educated on the planet in terms of the vagaries of foreign exchange and what that means for a shopping basket. And the steps that we take are entirely driven by the currency. And if you talk qualitatively with consumers in Brazil for example, they can almost tell you what the price of the goods that they buy are going to be based on the foreign exchange moves. I guess the good way to think about it is that our kinds of products, yes, you're talking taking pricing but you're talking taking pricing on an everyday product and at relatively modest levels on top of that. So it does not affect their loyalty to the brand over time. They have opportunities in terms of the different sizes we have to buy at different price points and therefore mitigate the cost impact from a cash outlay point of view, which indeed they do do. But interestingly, they don't even trade down within our portfolio. So if they're buying the premium end of the Colgate portfolio, they keep buying that. They don't trade down to perhaps what you might say is a more economical option within our portfolio. So our kinds of products at the time these economies are going through what they are going through become the affordable luxuries that people continue to put in their shopping basket. So that's the way I would answer it, John. Operator : We will now move on to Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Good morning, Ian. I'm trying to try in sneak two questions on two different tacks. The first one is just to clarify what you said earlier I think in response to Olivia's question. Did you say that mix was not a factor in your reported volume? Because I thought it was. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Mix is in \u2013 we have a dollar-weighted volume. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So it's in the volume. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. So it's in the volume. Okay. Okay. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : In other words, it's not separate. She was looking for a separate contribution. That was our point. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. And so just building on that, as you were discussing with Ali, as the volume improves sequentially as pricing subsides, just from a marketplace dynamic, do you expect more of a unit volume recovery or is it more of a resumption of trade-up? Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we'll get both. We'll get both. But the volume will recover and it will not all be trade-up. Operator : We will now move on to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Lauren. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Could we talk a little bit about gross margins? I think maybe your \u2013 I would think maybe you're a little disappointed that no one's asked you about it yet given gross margins were up 190 basis points. So if you could run through the bridge for us. And then also just talk about how that impacts your view of the moving pieces for the balance of the year. I guess I'll have a follow-up once I know what the key drivers were. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I was going to ask you to repeat the question because I like hearing 190 basis points. So if we just do the traditional roll forward, the prior-year gross profit was 58.3%. We got the benefit, 110 basis points of the pricing. We had between funding the growth and restructuring \u2013 restructuring modest in gross profit, as you know, 190 basis points favorable. Material prices were a headwind of 110 basis points. Nothing in all other. And that gets you to the 60.2% which is the 190 basis points. Now, as we think about that for the balance of the year, I mean, first pleasingly \u2013 although these pleasing moments are quickly behind you, but pleasingly this is the second back-to-back quarter now we've been above 60% in gross margin, which, as you know, was a company goal. Indeed, the second edged slightly up on the first. But if you look at your gross profit for the first half of the year, it's up 150 basis points. 1.5 points. So as we, as you, think about the balance of the year, I guess what we would say is our expectation is that our gross margin increase for the second half of the year will be around the same level as the first half, maybe even a little bit higher. And the primary driver of that of course is transaction headwinds will start to lessen as the foreign exchange comparisons, bar another event in our world, improve year upon year. Operator : We will now move on to Iain Simpson with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker): Thank you very much. One of your competitors recently commented that oral care was a category that would potentially lend itself to an online subscription model, the advantage being that it would increase rates of toothbrush replacement. Just wondered if that was something you felt able to make any comment on or I guess any thoughts around direct to consumer e-commerce more generally. Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We think it's a great idea. Operator : All right. And we will now move on to Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks, and morning, everybody. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Mark. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I wanted to ask about Hill's. So in the press release, innovation is called out, seems to be largely driven by prescription Science Diet. I didn't see any mention in there of the natural or Ideal Balance categories, brands. So I guess curious if you could comment on why the focus seems to be on the nutrition science, not naturals which I guess it has been more so in recent years and if there's anything we should read into it from a consumer preference standpoint in terms of changing tastes out there. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't think so. I think whatever we do on Hill's, whatever we have done on Hill's, we are always extremely focused as a matter of strategy on the nutrition the diets provide; doesn't matter whether it is a prescription product, a Science product, or even our Ideal Balance product. I think the thing you might want to read into it is that after we introduced Ideal Balance, we have been through an extensive process of changing the formula composition of our Science Diet product \u2013 at least the one not recommended or prescribed by a vet \u2013 to change the composition of the ingredients in those products to lead with protein and other ingredients that buyers of natural products value thereby no longer providing them with a reason to walk away from the nutrition of Science Diet because Science Diet doesn't offer them a formula composition that they're looking for. And that was a significant change that we made to make that piece of the business less vulnerable to a naturals pure play. So Ideal Balance is doing okay but I would say our major shift has been to make sure from a dietary composition point of view that our core Science Diet business is competitive. And, of course, in making that change have validated the fact that the nutritional benefit that the pet is provided is completely unchanged in making that formula adjustment. So I guess that's the way I would think about it. And all of the innovation that Bina talked about on the prescription diet side, as you've seen with the weight products, we translate that science, if you will, across Science Diet and even bring it to Ideal Balance, although we would market it in different ways given the different positionings of each of those three segments of the business. Operator : We will take our final question from Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for the follow-up. So, sorry in advance for the technical question, but just as I'm asking you about how you define things in your reporting, if I think about Europe where you see pricing down again 3% this quarter, which I understand is a well-documented trend, if I go back to 2009 and just index your portfolio to 100 and multiply it through the reported pricing, it implies that you're pricing \u2013 your portfolio is down almost 20% in aggregate since that time. And obviously there's been a big continuous mix component, I'm assuming, as you roll in new premium innovation that's help offset that in the volume line. But as I think about how that flows through to margins, I'm assuming that that premiumization has been beneficial to margins, but if I look at how you define the buckets of margin drivers, especially by segment, you typically call out funding the growth and then all-in kind of raw and packaging costs and then pricing. I just want to understand, maybe using Europe as an example, when there's a significant mix benefit or impact on margins, where does that fall? Is that netting against pricing that mix benefit or is it somehow contributing to funding the growth as it relates to your margin drivers? Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you for the simple question. I think the mix benefit clearly is picked up in gross margin. And I would say it would be between pricing and cost in the gross margin calculation, base cost. Operator : And we don't have any other questions at this time. Ian M. Cook - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you. Thank you ever so much. Thank you for your interest in the company in these turbulent times, and we look forward to updating you all as the year unfolds. And we take the opportunity to thank all of the Colgate folk that work so hard to make this happen. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and the most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Table 8 and Table 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Now, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John. John A. Faucher - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Thank you, Jessica. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; Elaine Paik, Treasurer; and, Bina Thompson, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On a reported basis, our net sales were down 3.5% in the third quarter due to the impact of foreign exchange, the impact of the Venezuelan deconsolidation and the divestiture of our detergent business in the South Pacific. That said, we continued to deliver strong organic sales growth in the third quarter with organic sales up 4.5%, within our targeted range of 4% to 7% despite a continued difficult global macro environment. Our organic sales growth was driven by a combination of volume growth, excluding the impact of divestitures and the deconsolidation of Venezuela, and improvement in pricing. We delivered organic sales growth in every division this quarter, but I would particularly point out Latin America where we delivered double-digit growth on a double-digit comparison. Excluding charges from the restructuring program in both periods, gross profit margin was up 160 basis points in third quarter 2016 versus third quarter 2015 led by cost savings from our funding-the-growth initiatives and our restructuring program. This gross margin expansion allowed us to increase worldwide advertising year-over-year, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of sales. On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin was up 140 basis points versus the year ago period. Excluding the items specified in Table 8 of our press release, our operating profit grew 1% in dollar terms and our earnings per share were $0.73, also up 1% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, operating profit decreased 6% to $1.071 billion and earnings per share in Q3 were $0.78 compared with $0.80 in the third quarter of 2015. Through strong working capital performance, we continue to grow our free cash flow, further strengthening our balance sheet. Year-to-date, our free cash flow before dividends is up 17% year-over-year and our net cash provided by operations is up 10% year-over-year. We continue to be faced with macroeconomic challenges in many parts of the world coupled with an uncertain currency environment. Despite this, the Colgate team remains committed over the long term to delivering sustainable 4% to 7% organic sales growth with productivity driven gross margin expansion and double-digit earnings per share growth on a dollar basis. Now, we'll go through performance in the divisions; first, North America. North America posted net sales, volume, organic sales and operating profit growth in the quarter. Market shares are up year-to-date in most of our key categories and our innovation continues to perform well with a strong pipeline planned as we head into 2017. A few North America highlights from the quarter; our U.S. toothpaste business continues to grow and increase market share, with year-to-date market shares up 30 basis points. In Q3, our market share was up 70 basis points year-over-year. Our new products, like Colgate Optic White High Impact White and Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpastes are driving volume growth at premium prices. Colgate Total Daily Repair has helped the Colgate Total franchise to a 10.5% share of market on a year-to-date basis. Colgate Optic White High Impact White has helped the Colgate Optic White franchise to its highest share ever at 6.8% in the third quarter versus 6.5% year-to-date and 5.7% for full year 2015. We are also seeing sequential and year-over-year improvement in market shares for our sensitivity business, helped by our latest launch of Colgate Sensitive Smart White toothpaste. Our U.S. manual toothbrush share is up 50 basis points year-to-date. The Colgate 360\u00b0 franchise continues to perform well with market share of almost 23% year-to-date, up from 20.4% for full year 2015. In particular, the recent new product launches of Colgate 360\u00b0 Enamel Health Whitening Toothbrush and the Colgate 360\u00b0 Total Advanced 4 Zone Manual Toothbrush, which just launched in Q3, have added one full share point year-to-date. Tom's of Maine also posted good growth in the quarter with year-to-date market share up 20 basis points versus last year driven by new products, particularly Rapid Relief toothpaste. In Personal Care, we continued to gain share in both liquid hand soap and body wash, driven by news products. Softsoap Pure foaming hand soap and Softsoap Luminous Oils and Irish Spring Signature For Men body washes are all contributing to year-to-date share growth in Personal Care. Now, Latin America; the strong organic sales growth posted by Latin America in the first half continued into Q3. Organic sales growth accelerated to 10.5% despite a sequentially more difficult comparison. Latin America also returned to volume growth in Q3 following flat volumes in Q2. All of this is excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela. While currency and the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation resulted in a net sales decline in this division, productivity from funding-the-growth and pricing helped deliver 410 basis points of operating profit margin expansion. This led to operating profit being down just slightly despite a mid-single digit headwind from foreign exchange. There are several highlights across the division. In toothpaste, our share year-to-date is up 20 basis points year-over-year. In our Oral Care business, we also saw share gains in mouthwash and power toothbrushes. In Brazil, our toothpaste share is at 73.2% year-to-date, up 1.1 share points year-over-year. We are seeing strong share growth, both in Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection. We are also seeing toothpaste share gains year-to-date in Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay and Puerto Rico. In Mexico, we maintained toothpaste market leadership with a greater than 80% share behind strength in our Colgate Luminous White brand. We believe we possess solid momentum as we head toward 2017 not just in toothpaste, but across our entire portfolio in Mexico with significant new product activity across many categories. Other highlights in the quarter for Latin America include market share gains in mouthwash behind the Plax Ice Infinity brand across the region; share gains in the Kids oral care segment behind the Minions regimen; and, share gains on our underarm protection business in Mexico behind Speed Stick, Lady Speed Stick and Stefano. Also, we had significant new product activity in our household segment; in our fabric care business with Suavitel Superior Care and Suavitel Sweet Pleasures; and, on cleaners with Fabuloso Pure Cleaning continuing to add incremental share year-to-date. Moving to Europe, Europe delivered another quarter of positive organic sales growth despite a difficult market environment impacted by macroeconomic conditions, FX and retail dynamics. Organic sales were up 1.5% in the quarter with positive volumes and negative pricing in the market. Net sales were down year-over-year impacted by foreign exchange headwinds. Market share performance in Europe is strong. We continued our toothpaste share leadership with over 35% of the market, flat year-to-date versus year ago. We have seen share of the market gains year-to-date in manual and battery toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap, body lotion and fabric softeners. Q3 highlights in the European division include : we continue to gain significant share in manual toothbrushes in Europe behind the strength of our toothbrush plus whitening pen. This premium-priced product has allowed us to gain more than 200 basis points of market share in the manual toothbrush category year-to-date. Our share momentum in body wash is continuing, up 40 basis points year-to-date behind both Sanex and Palmolive. On Palmolive, we are expanding the rollout of our Palmolive Gourmet line and are seeing strong results across many markets. While still early days, we are encouraged by the performance of Sanex Men, which includes body washes, shampoo and underarm protection. This line is focused on men's skin health. This launch is also driving solid growth in underarm protection in France and Spain. Fabric care grew nicely in the quarter in Europe, driven primarily by Germany. We will see further rollout of the Soupline Complete Care line of fabric conditioners in the fourth quarter. And now, Asia-Pacific; organic sales growth in Asia-Pacific was 3% driven predominantly by volume with pricing up slightly year-over-year. Volume growth in the division was led by the Philippines and India. Net sales were down in the quarter, primarily due to the divestiture of the laundry detergent business in the South Pacific. Operating profit was up slightly year-over-year despite the net sales decline as the benefits from pricing, mix and savings from funding-the-growth and the restructuring program more than offset increases in raw material costs and advertising investment. Some Q3 highlights in Asia- Pacific include : in the Philippines on a year-to-date basis, our toothpaste share increased 350 basis points versus year ago to 62.8%, driven by strength across multiple price tiers. Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Sensitive have combined to add more than three share points year-to-date. Other markets with share growth in toothpaste included Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Zealand, Vietnam and Pakistan. Both India and the Philippines saw share growth in manual toothbrushes year-to-date with both markets up more than 1% in share of market behind the Colgate Zig Zag franchise. We have many new product launches in the second half of the year that we think will drive continued top-line growth heading into 2017. Now, Africa/Eurasia. Our business across the division remained solid despite macroeconomic challenges and continued currency headwinds. Organic sales growth in the quarter was 8.5%, driven by growth across most of the region. The organic sales growth was driven by double-digit pricing, with volume down 2%. Net sales and operating profit were up year-over-year despite a 7% foreign exchange headwind. Significant margin improvement was driven by strong pricing and funding-the-growth savings, partially offset by higher raw materials and packaging costs. Overall, our toothpaste market shares in Africa/Eurasia continue to trend positively. Q3 highlights in the Africa/Eurasia division include : our toothpaste market share in Turkey continues to grow year-over-year driven by Colgate Total. Colgate Total brand market share is up 80 basis points year-to-date driven by the Colgate Total Pro line with share growth of Pro Breath Health and Pro White. In South Africa, we continued to grow share year-over-year and our market share is above 50% year-to-date after finishing just below 50% in 2014 and 2015. We had strong new product activity in the quarter behind both toothpaste, with two Colgate Optic White variants launching in South Africa and North Africa/Middle East, and toothbrushes, with Colgate 360\u00b0 Charcoal Gold and Colgate Slim Soft Sensitive Gum Care. Moving on to Hill's, Q3 was a challenging quarter for Hill's as strong growth in emerging markets was offset by challenges in developed markets. Organic sales were up 1.5% in the quarter driven by pricing, as volume was down 2%. Net sales were also up and included a benefit from slightly favorable currency. Operating profit grew 3%. Gross margin was up slightly as funding-the-growth savings and pricing offset higher costs. Volume in the quarter was negatively impacted by a difficult retail environment in most developed markets. We continue to see solid growth in the vet and neighborhood pet channels with particularly strong growth online. Developing market volumes were up nicely, driven by Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic + Mobility and Metabolic + Urinary, Hill's Prescription Diet Derm Defense and Hill's Prescription Diet z/d. So to sum up, in what is proving to be a difficult macro environment for consumer packaged goods companies, we are pleased with how 2016 is progressing. We are delivering organic sales growth within our targeted range and Colgate people around the world are working diligently through funding-the-growth initiatives and our global growth and efficiency program to deliver notable gross margin improvement. Our outlook for 2017, while still taking shape, is balanced in order to continue our path of sustainable growth into next year and beyond. Our innovation pipeline is full and we're excited about what is yet to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jessica, and Ian will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll first go to Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hey, Dara. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So Ian, Hill's organic sales growth weakened considerably in the quarter on a sequential basis. It's been a few years since we saw that level of growth, so I was just hoping you could give us a bit more detail on some of the drivers there, if you view it as more of a quarterly blip or the issues could linger. And also, any commentary around category growth and if you saw any slowdown in your channels in the quarter would be helpful, also. Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah. Happy to do that, Dara. I must say, it would be remiss of me if I did not repeat the fact that with the array of businesses we have and in the world we are doing business how pleased we are to sustain that 4.5% clip of top-line growth and continue to expand margin and invest in the business to drive that growth. That said, you're right. As we said in the release and as John called out, the third quarter was challenging for the Hill's business. I would say, first of all, that structurally there is nothing wrong with the Hill's business. We have a very clear model which is driven by the recommendations we get for the Prescription Diet product, which cures ailments of pets, and then takes those pet parents to the Science Diet for maintaining a healthy condition; recommendation-driven, scientifically-proven with an innovation flow that is very, very strong for the business. So, not a portfolio or a structural issue. I think it is fairly widely reported that there has been a slowdown in consumer purchasing at, what you might call the traditional retail outlets. The neighborhood pet stores and vets continue to grow quite nicely, but of particular note is the explosive growth we are seeing with online. And we see that both in the U.S. and we see that in Europe, and that is clearly a growth that we are very much after, driving Hill's into that online business; and we've seen some fairly dramatic sales growth, but we haven't yet kept pace with the growth of online. So you see the traditional somewhat pressured. And while we're doing very, very well in ramping up our online business, we have a ways to go to catch the full potential of the business. So, our view is that we will see progress \u2013 sequential progress going forward and we expect to realize the full potential of that online channel as we move our way across the first half of next year. So I guess that's the way I would frame the Hill's business, Dara. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, and do you have a rough idea of what kind of share you have online versus the channels you are exposed to currently? Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: On the Hill's business, as I suggested in my remarks, we are under-developed online; therefore, our share would be a little bit lower. There is tremendous pet parent reception to the Hill's products online, so as I said, we expect that to improve as we move through the balance of this year and across the first half of next year. But under-developed and an opportunity, and an opportunity we are going after with focus. Operator : Thank you. We'll now go to Wendy Nicholson from Citi Research. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I just have a quick follow-up on that, if that's okay, and then a real question. But just in terms of the online strategy, is there a danger that you are being too selective? And what I mean by that is, if you go on Amazon, there are only a few Hill's SKUs available, but there's a huge amount of Blue Buffalo and Iams and Eukanuba and whatnot. So when you say you're working to expand, are you expanding on something as oriented to mass as Amazon, because I know you were very careful about not going to the mass fixed retail channel? So that's my just follow-up. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah. I mean, if that wasn't a real question, I'm not sure whether I have to give you a real answer, Wendy. The \u2013 but I shall. The \u2013 I think the learning in this space starts with the consumer, and what we're finding is that the consumer is not just interrogating our online Hill's pet nutrition site for information about the pet nutrition products they may choose to buy for their pets, but they're also interrogating all of the websites out there, including the Amazons of this world. So our e-commerce strategy is to reach the consumers where they are learning about the brand and where we can educate them about the brand, which is a large part of the Hill's model. And that capability exists on all of the e-sites that are out there and, therefore, our e-strategy is broad in that regard. You will see the depth of our portfolio build and you will see a Hill's presence grow sharply online. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then, my second question, and I apologize, but just when you think about those charts that you've shown historically, per capita consumption and how it's been growing steadily in some of the really more emerging markets, are you seeing a tapering off of that given the macro? I'm trying to get underneath the volume slowdown and how much of that is a competitive activity or just how much are consumers in China and India and emerging Southeast Asia or wherever, just not shifting into the toothpaste category, specifically, maybe at the same rate that they had been historically? Thank you Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yes. Thanks, Wendy. Absolutely no basis to conclude that; none. And we continue to see people come into our category. Yes, we have in these emerging markets, as you have noted, taken pricing to offset the transaction impact of the foreign exchange, but quite interestingly in Latin America, for example, we now have returned to volume growth in that geography. The China situation is very much a continuation of what we described on the last call, which is, again, a slowdown in the traditional purchasing behavior of consumers and a sharp increase in online purchasing, which has led to a destocking process from an inventory point of view that is underway. Our online business doubled, again, in China in the third quarter. Our quarter-on-quarter performance there improved and we expect, as we said on the last call, to see that improvement continue. So China is a particular circumstance that we described in terms of broad-based consumer behavior in the emerging markets; absolutely no indication that moving into our category or staying with our category is any way under pressure. Operator : And we'll now go to Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Ian, just looking sort of countrywide, could you discuss the increase in local competition in markets like India and China and how you are working to address local competitors; and also, just update us, perhaps, on the UK, Russia. And it sounds like you're actually growing in Brazil and Argentina even though lots of other people aren't; so just a little bit of a look around the world, please. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: I think you left a couple of countries off there, Caroline. So to take your one question by point, we have talked quite extensively, I think, over the quarters about local competitors. They do continue to be there. We see them in Latin America, although the intensity of that local competition has eased somewhat. We see that in India and we have seen that in China; although, again, in China the principal local competitor market share has flattened for the last couple of quarters. I think the underlying trend there, as we mentioned on our previous phone call, is an opportunity to engage. And this is really a global trend, I would say; think about Tom's in the U.S. But to engage more broadly and deeply in what you might call, generally, the natural space, and this is very much part of our innovation programming that we see going forward. In Russia, we took some very swift action in the early days of the severe currency devaluation, both structurally, both pricing, in order that we could rebuild our margins and continue to drive the growth of that business where the market share continues to grow in Russia; and quite nicely, I would add. And in the UK, despite all of the post-Brexit doom and gloom, we \u2013 our business is okay in the UK. There's nothing I would call out of particular import in that country. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning. Thanks very much. My question was on SG&A. There was a nice reduction this quarter year-over-year and I'm trying to understand where we stand in terms of non-advertising SG&A in terms of total potential to make that more efficient. And specifically, can you remind me how much of that would be in dollars and, if possible, what effect currency has had and continues to have on that reduction over the past few years, and particularly this quarter? Thanks very much. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: I think last time we spoke, Jonathan, you said I could call you Jon. So I'll call you Jon. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Oh, you can call me whatever you want, Ian. We're still on that basis. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: I wouldn't go that far. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : You don't know me that well, yet. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: I think the first thing we would say about SG&A is we were very pleased with the increase in advertising that we saw across all of our operating divisions in this quarter; funded, of course, by the progress we made on gross margin. You're right; we had a very sharp focus on the non-advertising SG&A expense. And of course, that progress was to be delivered by our global growth and efficiency program, and I would comment that that program remains absolutely on track. Of course, you do suffer a little bit of a deleverage in terms of the top-line from the foreign exchange point of view. So while our overheads are down on a dollar basis, the ratio is modestly up, basically in line with prior year because of that deleverage. And I would also say that when we talked about the global growth and efficiency program, even though people sort of distill it as a restructuring, part of our reason for the titling of it was we are taking some of the savings that we are making and reinvesting in capability; for example, (30:34) capability in some key markets, e-commerce capability in other markets, and traditional advertising and sampling on certain categories and geographies. But you're right, it is our intention through the global growth and efficiency program, which has one more year to run, to continue to control \u2013 drive down if we can, but certainly be selective and choiceful about where we make the non-advertising investments in SG&A. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll now go to Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. Thank you. On the 2017 outlook, it's nice to see your expectation for a return to double-digit earnings growth next year. So what's your assumption of the macro environment underlying that versus looking at your innovation plan and anticipating greater market share improvement? Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah. You know, Olivia, I would \u2013 we provide a 2017 guidance at this time as we do and have done for prior years, but it would be remiss of me if I didn't stress the fact that we are very much at the beginning of our budgeting process, whether that's on a GAAP basis or non-GAAP basis, and I don't think it would be appropriate to provide more color on 2017 at this stage. Obviously, as we usually do, we will come back more fulsomely in January and give you the update on the outcome of our budgeting process. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it, and I look forward to that. Perhaps, can we talk a little bit about the pricing that you saw in Q3? Is that primarily continuation of price increases that you've already taken or did you take incremental pricing for this quarter? Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: No. No, in some markets we took fresh pricing. You know foreign exchange in some parts of the world continued to be a headwind. We faced the transaction cost impact which we had to offset. And in some material streams, think fats and oils, there was indeed some upward pressure on the underlying cost of the raw material and we, likewise, took pricing to offset that. So, there was indeed new pricing in the quarter. Actually, the one thing I will say about 2017, although I do think it's been said before, is that the innovation pipeline, as you intimated, that underlines the budgeting process we are going into is very strong. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go to Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hi, Ali. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. I want to pull a few threads together from our discussion, today, along two vectors. One is e-commerce, obviously, is not very new. And so, are you at risk at feeling \u2013 or are you perhaps even already feeling the same impact from being underrepresented on e-commerce for any other pieces of your business, given some of the volume challenges we've seen, so especially U.S, China, arguably Western Europe? So that's one question. The other one is, I guess, more broadly and, perhaps, more importantly, just a question of sustainability, right? So \u2013 and I'm not talking about environmental sustainability, just sustainability of your numbers. It just felt like this past quarter was a little bit tougher. So, at lease versus consensus, you missed, it looks like, organic sales growth for all regions but two. You had some disappointments in South Africa; clearly Hill's, which you've talked about; clearly relying a lot more on inflationary pricing in Latin America, now a little bit more in Asia-Pacific; and then, the shares, at least from omission, look like UK might be share loss or flat, China similar, India similar, Mexico similar. So I just want your reaction to that. And I know you're going to be benign on that reaction, but really as an investor or as an analyst, what shouldn't give us pause about those types of facts looking forward? So, thanks for those two. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Sure, Ali; happy to do that. The answer to your first question is, no. We are not concerned about being underrepresented. We hear a lot of our competitors talk about e-commerce, how it is a significant trend and how the full potential of it hasn't been tapped. We are seeing our market share grow and we're very comfortable with the plans we have in place of that \u2013 we have in place, period. In terms of our business, I guess it's kind of a question and a statement from you in terms of the second half. I think if you look at the macros that everybody entered the third quarter into, there were quite a few, shall we say, surprises on the downside. We have not been quiet about the challenges we have had specific to the Hill's business and we have not been quiet about the e-commerce effect in China, which we commented on in the second quarter. Our market shares, if you take our global market share, it's up on a constant currency basis. It's up on a volume basis. We are seeing the volume in Latin America come back, even with incremental pricing. And our market shares are strong around the world and we have plans, market by market, that we will be going through for 2017 that we believe will give us the confidence to sustain that 4% to 7% top-line growth in these uncertain times and create the necessary margin expansion to deliver the bottom line. So all I can really point to is the history of performance, the current performance in the quarter and the clarity of strategy and focus on delivery against that strategy, and then the execution of that that I think we have demonstrated for a while, notwithstanding comments over the years about penetration can't go up, per capita consumption can't go up, markets must slow, a whole plethora of so-called risks against the business which I think, across the company, we have successfully navigated and believe we can continue to do so going forward. Operator : And we'll now go to Bill Chappell from SunTrust. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hey, Bill. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: In the spirit of sneaking in two questions, one on 2017, I know it's in budget process, but any early outlook on where we stand today, what currency headwind would be to top and bottom line? And then, the other one just on the Europe business, I think there was commentary about increased promotional and advertising, I guess, a little more than we've seen the prior couple quarters. Anything going on there? Is it getting more competitive or is just timing of new launches or any more color there? Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yes. You know, Bill, it'll be easier, actually, because I'm only going to answer one of the questions. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Perfect. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: I think in terms of foreign exchange, that's the reason we go through the budgeting process. We will be extremely fulsome when we meet together in January. In Europe, I don't think the European environment is a secret or a surprise to anyone. The growth is very muted. On aggregate, categories, if they're up, they're up modestly. More often than not they're flat, and in some cases they are down. And you see competitors who are perhaps overweight in Europe looking to make the most out of it. We manage that as judiciously as we can, as we have done in the past; so nothing that I would call out that is new and different in that environment. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: But something that should continue, I guess, going forward in terms of that level of promotion advertising? Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: As it has done in the past, Bill. I mean, again, there's nothing new there. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Thanks Operator : And we'll now go to Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hey, Bill. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, what's the right way to build an e-commerce business for a consumer products company? Everyone talks about omni-channel, but it seems like you're going to have to displace an incumbent and annoy them if you're really going to build out the e-commerce business. So how do you manage that and the push back you're probably going to get from some of your incumbent retailers? And then, can you just tell us how your e-commerce strategy works? Like, is there a head of e-commerce at Colgate or is it embedded in the segments? Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Well, I think you have to grow e-commerce businesses like any other business, for the long haul; and build them thoughtfully \u2013 build them thoughtfully. I think the principle that one starts with is that you must service the consumer where they are. And again, we are agnostic. If they prefer to shop online, we are just as happy to have them shop online with the e-commerce site of a traditional retail partner as a standalone retail outlet \u2013 e-commerce outlet. So we go where the consumer is. And as we think about that, we have globally a central capability, which I would say is strategy and capabilities oriented, that defines our global strategy, the tools and techniques and approach that we will deploy around the world. But then, very much in the operating divisions, and specifically on the ground, we have e-commerce teams and we manage the finances of our e-commerce business on a standalone basis so we understand the investments and the return we are getting from that business. So as you might imagine, for us it's planful and thoughtful and, of course, it is wrapped around by our overall digital strategy. And I would comment, you may remember the executive, Maria Elisa Carvajal, who presented at CAGNY last year about digital, she today is running our global advertising group; so taking that skill set and wrapping it around everything that we are doing digitally. But thoughtful, for the long haul, in service of the consumer, with the right global capabilities, and then a very clear on-the-ground focus. Operator : And we'll now go to Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hey, Lauren. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hello. I was hoping you'd talk a little bit about macro environment in Brazil, kind of category growth rates? And then, specifically, I think the two products that John called out in his script that are doing well in oral care would suggest you're holding on to share as consumers trade down to the more low-end of the category; so, just a macro picture and what you are seeing through your business as a result. And then, just at the risk of missing the chance for someone else to ask it, if you could run through the gross margin bridge it would be great. Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Well, I think the macros in Brazil, Lauren, are pretty clear to all. And I think as we look forward, we don't see a hockey stick bounce-back any time soon. Interestingly, perhaps for reasons of the change there, the foreign exchange has behaved favorably so far this year. The net effect on our categories has been to see a slowdown from a volume point of view, albeit a growth in local currency still around that mid-single digit area largely driven by pricing. As we have said before about Brazil, our focus is on making sure whatever the category size is we are doing everything possible to stay connected with our consumer and grow market share with our consumer. And John mentioned those two new products. That's what we are focused on while having to take pricing historically as we have done, and I think we have said before that we fully expect the volume of our business to come back once that pricing has settled in. So we remain strategically committed to Brazil. We just think it's going to be a bumpy ride for the next little while. And if you take the gross profit roll forward for the third quarter, you take the prior year at 58.8% gross profit, pricing was 1.1 points favorable in this quarter. Restructuring and funding-the-growth savings were 2.2 points favorable. And the headwind of material prices was 1.8 negative, and a large part of that was related to transaction costs. The other on the quarter was a favorable 0.1 and that gets you to the 60.4% and the 160 basis points increase. Now, when we provided our results for the second quarter, you know, we made the comment that our gross profit expansion for the first half of this year had been 150 basis points and, at that time, we said that we expected \u2013 or suggested that you might want to look at the second half as being a similar 150 basis points. Obviously, this quarter was 160 basis points, so the way we would frame the year to go is to say that in the fourth quarter we would expect a sequential \u2013 as it has been for the last three quarters, a sequential improvement in the absolute gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter; sequential from the third quarter to the fourth quarter to close out the year. So we would say that's the way you should be thinking about gross profit. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we'll now go to Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for the question. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hey, Jason. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, I want to pick up on that gross margin bridge. When you do the calculations on the numbers you just laid out, it implies that year-to-date productivity in COGS dollars is running around $211 million, which is about $50 million shy of your year-to-date run rate in the last couple of years. So question one on gross margins is \u2013 with fading productivity, is this just timing-related? Should we expect it tick up or would you \u2013 rounding out year two of the most recent productivity program, is the savings winding down? And then, on inflation, inflation stepped up as a percentage of COGS, I think running around 4.4%, which is above the sub-3% rate for the first half. It's a bit surprising given FX. We would've thought the transaction drag to be abating, but I do note that it's typical with cadence for you historically. For some reason, inflation is lower in the front half and higher in the back. So I guess, on cadence, why is that the historical pattern? And is this nothing more than a replication of a historical pattern or should we underwrite the acceleration of inflation as something you're going to have to contest with on the forward? Sorry, a lot's there. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yes, there is. Starting from the end and coming back to the beginning, I think you are right to say that as foreign exchange lessens, the transaction impact lessons. And if you go back over the quarters we have reported, we are seeing that. But the other aspect of inflation is related to some of the commodities that we had mentioned in world markets where the underlying cost of the material is actually going up, and that is partially offsetting the benefit of the lesser transaction cost. Now, you know, as we get into our budgeting process and without guiding for 2017, we have so far not seen anything on the horizon from an underlying commodity cost that is a significant headwind. So our going-in position, to be validated as we go through the process, is no immediate underlying commodity issues and you've seen the forward projections on foreign exchanges yourself. So I guess that would be the answer to the second half. On the funding-the-growth, I wouldn't get obsessive about the year-to-date this year. Our funding-the-growth program is very much in the company. This is not exactly a linear predictable thing in terms of all of the projects we have, some bigger than others. Interestingly, our pipeline for 2017 is fuller than it has been in some prior years, so I would not say this is a slowdown to be expected going forward. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : Iain Simpson with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has our next question. Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker): Thank you very much. You're probably bored of talking about them by now, but just on those adjusted gross margins, Ian, thanks very much for the breakdown you've already given. I just wondered if you could remind us how much, if any, tailwind you've got on the gross margin level from the deconsolidation of Venezuela. And a second much broader question, channel shift is clearly causing some disruption in both Hill's and China. I just wondered if there were any other areas you'd highlight where we're beginning to see channel shift occurring and maybe we should keep an eye on them for the potential for business disruption in the coming quarters. Thank you Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yes, I think e-commerce is \u2013 digital, in general, is a transformational trend in business, in general. But I think in terms of our businesses, what we are seeing is that that business, which is to say Hill's, and that geography is particularly leading edge. You can rest assured, as we answered to an earlier question, that our focus on e-commerce is a global one. And we are experimenting vigorously, even where e-commerce markets may be nascent, to try and drive as aggressively as we can; so, nothing I would particularly call out. And in terms of the gross margin, you're right. Venezuela is in there. Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker): Thank you. Have you quantified the benefit from deconsolidating Venezuela at all, or any sort of indication? Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: No, we haven't, Iain. There was a lot of clamor before the deconsolidation about the contribution to the top-line. Since the deconsolidation, that has gone away and now the clamor is on the gross margin; and, we had likewise resisted providing that single country breakout. We don't provide single country breakout information, and in 2017 it will all be behind us. Iain E. Simpson - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker): Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Sure. Operator : And we'll now go to Erin Lash with Morningstar. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thank you for taking the question. I know we've spent a lot of time on the call talking about Hill's, but I was hoping to just follow up. Beyond some of the channel shifts that you're saying, has there been any change in the competitive landscape in that particular business, specifically within the developed markets? And subsequently, have there been any notable \u2013 maybe the price gaps have been shifting relative to what you're seeing with Hill's versus the competition? Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: I would say the broad answer to that question, Erin, is no on both. I think, again, if you take it from the point of view of strategy, our strategy is to partner aggressively with all e-commerce channels, because that's how the consumer is shopping. So \u2013 be they e-commerce sites with traditional retailers or standalone. So if you take that definition, there are no new competitive players out there that we perhaps are not already engaged with. And, obviously, we have clear pricing strategies for our brands. Retailers are the ones who ultimately dictate what the shelf or online price is, but we are quite disciplined about the price movement of our business and I wouldn't call out anything unusual in that regard. No. Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from Steve Powers with UBS. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hey, Steve. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Thanks. Hey, so it was discussed earlier, but pricing this quarter was, again, really strong in Latin America and Africa/Eurasia, but I wanted to come back to it because it's the first time in a while that the magnitude of the pricing that you've delivered has outpaced the magnitude of the FX headwind you faced, if that makes sense. So I'd just love to get a better idea of to what extent you feel you can continue current pricing as you play catch-up and price away the inflation that you've been absorbing over the past year. Or conversely, if we should expect pricing now in those regions to more quickly decelerate, especially as some currencies, like you mentioned Brazil, have recently trended more favorably. And if it does retrace lower, do you feel the consumer environment is healthy enough to \u2013 for you to see an offsetting uptick in volume? Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yes. You know, I think as we entered the year, we felt that volume would be a larger contributor to our growth than in prior years. As we worked our way into the year, we found foreign exchange continued to bedevil and we were, of necessity, forced to take pricing to protect our margin and rebuild the margin, which would \u2013 after three years of that gross profit being flat, to rebuild that gross profit so that we could invest in the business. And as I said in response to an earlier question, we've already begun to see some of that transaction impact lesson as foreign exchange lessons, but then we have been faced with some underlying increase in commodity prices, particularly in fats and oils, and that has led to pricing in selective markets. All of that said, there is nothing that we see that suggests that faced with either underlying commodity pressures or foreign exchange that goes in a different direction than everybody is expecting, we believe we still have the capacity to take pricing to protect the gross profit and that the consumer continues to stay with the brand \u2013 the brands through those pricing actions. So we don't have that concern, Steve. Operator : We'll now go to Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks, and good morning for the \u2013 at least the next couple of minutes here. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hey, mark. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I went to ask about long-term sales algorithm sort of a different way. If end demand or global adoption of oral care isn't changing, as you said earlier, but had at least in the near term slightly weakening, that would seem to put some increased pressure on personal care and home care to perform better. I guess, given that, could you talk about trends in those two categories? I know you likely won't sort of give specifics about it, but could you talk about whether you're gaining or losing share in those categories, call it, over the last 12 months or 18 months, how you think about spend given it seems competition for those businesses is increasing these days? Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah. Well, actually, I'm not sure the premise of the question is right, because we still think there is terrific potential for sales growth in oral care as defined today and defined more broadly, which is how we do think about it. And the pet nutrition business, which as I said in response to an earlier question, we don't see anything structurally wrong with that business apart from dealing with reaching the consumers where they are shopping. So we don't think it puts more, 'underlying pressure' on the other businesses. As you know from our strategic prioritization, after oral and pet comes personal; and we have some great brands, as you know. We have some terrific successful innovation, whether it's on Palmolive, whether it's on Sanex, which we have talked about before, all of which have been successfully deployed in existing geographies and all of which have legs to transfer to other geographies. So we'll continue to advance all four of our businesses behind the strategy we have for each, the innovation we have for each and the support we have for each in the respective markets, but we don't think there's an underlying \u2013 because of one quarter's slow down on organic from Hill's, we don't think there's an underlying weakness in oral care or pet nutrition that needs to be structurally addressed by acceleration in the other businesses. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Could you at least talk about, directionally, whether you're gaining or losing share in those categories or maybe just sort of how we should all broadly think about it, because the disclosures, while yearly, aren't given on a quarterly basis? Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: We do fine in those businesses. I'm not sure what a market by market litany of share would actually give to the quality of assessment. So the businesses do well. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And it appears there are no further questions. I'll turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Well, thanks, Jessica, and thank you all for your questions and participating in the call. We look forward to catching up with you again in the new year, and a happy healthy holiday season to all of you. Operator : This concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation.",

Now, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John. John Faucher : Thanks, Alicia. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; Elaine Paik, Treasurer; and, Bina Thompson, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On a reported basis, our net sales were down 4.5% in the fourth quarter primarily due to foreign exchange and the impact of the Venezuelan deconsolidation. Organic sales were up 1.5% in the fourth quarter. The organic sales growth in the quarter was driven by improvement and pricing while volume excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela was down 1%. Pricing was up 2.5% in the quarter. Latin America was the driver of our organic sales growth this quarter posting continued volume growth, excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela and strong pricing. In other regions, we saw headwinds in several of our markets, some of which were driven by one-time factors like Indian demonetization and some distribution challenges in certain of our African businesses. We also did see a slowdown in category growth later in the quarter in some markets. For the year, reported net sales declined 5%, while our organic sales grew 4%, driven by a combination of pricing and volume growth. For the full-year, organic sales grew in every division except Europe which is flat. Excluding the items testified in table eight of our press release, gross profit margin was up 180 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus fourth quarter of 2015 led by cost savings from our funding and growth initiatives and our restructuring program. On a GAAP basis our growth profit margin was up 160 basis points in the fourth quarter 2016 from fourth quarter 2015. Excluding the items specified in table nine of our press release, our full-year growth profit margin rose 160 basis points to 60.3%. On a GAAP basis, our growth profit margin was up 140 basis points versus the year-ago period to 60.0%. Excluding the items specified in tables eight and nine of our press release, our operating profit was up 2% in the quarter and flat for the year. Operating profit on a GAAP basis was up significantly as we lapped a deconsolidation of our Venezuela and operation. Excluding the items in table eight of the press release deluded earnings per share on a dollar basis for the fourth quarter was $0.75 up 3% year-over-year. On a full-year basis, deluded earnings per share on a dollar basis excluding the items in table nine of our press release was even with last year was up double digits on a currency neutral basis after also excluding Venezuela's results in both periods. On a GAAP basis EPS was up 79% year-over-year primarily due to the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela in fourth quarter 2015. Very strong working capital performance we continue to grow our free cash flow further strengthening our balance sheet. For 2016, our net cash provided by operations was up 7%. A year-over-year reduction in capital expenditures as our restructuring program is entering its final stages meant a free cash flow before dividend was up 13% year-over-year. While the Q4 organic sale growth was lower than anticipated, we are optimistic that the pace of our growth will improve as we progress through the year drive by increased advertising support behind a full pipeline of new products around the world. From an EPS standpoint on a dollar basis, the excluding charges from the 2012 restructuring program and the other 2016 items specified in table nine of our press release based on current spot rates, we are planning for growth in the low single digits. The main drivers versus our previous expectation are foreign exchange and flowing category growth in several key markets. We expect free cash flow before dividends to be strong in 2017, reflecting solid operational results and continued focus on working capital. Now, we'll go through the performance in the division. First off North America. North American net sales, unit volume, pricing, foreign exchange and organic sales were all even with last year's fourth quarter. In the U.S., volume growth in two states was offset by declines in tooth brushes and liquid hand soap. In the quarter we saw strong volume growth for our Canadian business and put on demand. Operating profit declined 3% in the quarter. The gross profit margin expansion was more than offset by an increase in selling general and administrative expense. Up here, North American highlights in the quarter. In the U.S., we finished the year with market share is either upper flat majority of our categories, our innovation continues to perform well. We have a strong pipeline plan as we head into 2017. Our premiumization strategy continues to pay dividend. The Colgate Optic White franchise finished 2016 with 6.4% market share year-to-date up 80 basis points year-over-year. We expect further momentum in 2017 behind this month launch Colgate Optic White variant. We are also seeing year-over-year improvement in market share as for our sense for sensitivity business helped by our latest launch of Colgate Sensitive Smart White toothpaste. Tom's domain also posted a growth in the quarter in a year. Year-to-date Tom's toothpaste market share is up 20 basis points versus last year driven by new products particularly rapid relief sensitive toothpaste. Latin America finished the year strongly with organic sales growth of 10.5% in the fourth quarter. Including the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela and foreign exchange, net sales were down 10.5% for the quarter. We remind you that we have now lapped the Venezuela deconsolidation and 2017 numbers will not need to be adjusted. Excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela, we saw a volume growth of 1.5% in the quarter, with growth in markets including Mexico, Columbia and Argentina, partially offset by declines in Brazil. While currency and impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation resulted in a net sales decline in this division, productivity from funding the growth and pricing helped deliver 550 basis points of operating profit margin expansion. Thus operating profit grew in the quarter despite the net sales decline. Some highlights in Latin America include, in Brazil, our toothpaste share is at 73% year-to-date up one share point year-over-year. We are seeing strong share growth in both Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection. In Mexico we maintained toothpaste market leadership with an 81% share behind strength in our Colgate Luminous White brand with market share performance improving sequentially as we finish the year. We remain encouraged by the solid volume in organic sales performance of our Mexican business. Latin America should continue to see benefits from a strong innovation calendar in the second half of 2016. In personal care we've seen multiple innovations across the Protex, Palmolive, Speed Stick and Lady Speed Stick brands in the third and fourth quarter. Now, moving to Europe. Europe's net sales and organic sales in the fourth quarter were down year-over-year, with sales impacted by macroeconomic condition, foreign exchange and difficult retail dynamics. Organic sales were down 3.5% in the quarter driven primarily by volume declines in France, where our categories flowed sharply in the quarter with the United Kingdom partially offsetting the decline. Operating profit in Europe was down 5% in the quarter, driven by the net sales decline. Operating profit margin was up 70 basis points in the percentage of sales driven by lower selling general and administrative expenses. Our market share performance in Europe is solid. We continued our toothpaste share leadership at 35% of the market and our premium price Gard business continues to grow share, up 40 basis points here to date in Europe. We've seen regional share in market gains here-to-date in manual and battery toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap, body lotion and fabric softener. Our manual toothbrush here is up 170 basis points for 2016 driven by the premium priced Colgate Max White toothbrush with built-in whitening pen. In Q1, we have significant new product news in toothpaste, behind the launch of Colgate Enamel Strength and our Colgate Natural Extracts toothpaste. Now, Asia Pacific. Organic sales decline minus 2% in Asia Pacific with flat volume and negative pricing. Volume growth across most of the division was offset by a decline in India caused by the demonetization. The negative impact of foreign exchange further contributed to the net sales decline of 4% in the quarter. Operating profit was up 3% year-over-year, operating profit margin was up 240 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by lower selling general administrative expense. And points on Asia Pacific include, as mentioned above, in India, demonetization cost us a swing from strong growth through Q3 to a decline in Q4. Our recent launch of Colgate Cibaca that sharply continues to gain momentum in the fast growing natural space. In greater China, we still have work to do. But our organic sales growth improve sequentially and our volume is positive for the quarter. Our online business is accelerating, offsetting most of the impact from a difficult offline market. Now, Africa, Eurasia. Net sales in the region were down 1.5% in the quarter and organic sales declined 2%. Our Africa Eurasia business was negatively impacted by business disruptions with certain distributors primarily due to liquidity issues in Sub-Saharan Africa. Volume was down 12% in the quarter, driven by the Sub-Saharan Africa regions and South Africa. Pricing was up 10% and was positive across much of the region. Operating profit was down 4% in the quarter. Strong gross profit margin improvement driven by pricing and funding the growth was offset by increased advertising environment. Overall, our toothpaste market share is an after Eurasia continued to trend positively with our shares up year-to-date and the majority of our markets in the division. Q4 highlights in Africa Eurasia include our toothpaste market share in Turkey continues to grow year-over-year driven by Colgate Total. Colgate Total brand market share is up 70 basis points year-to-date driven by the Colgate Total Pro line which shared growth for Pro Breath Health and Pro White. And in Saudi Arabia, the second largest Oral Care market in the region, our toothpaste market share is up a 100 basis points year-to-date driven by Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection, Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief and Colgate Total. Now, finishing up with Hill. Q4 was a difficult quarter for Hill due to challenges in the pet facility channel. Organic sales were flat in the quarter as growth and pricing was offset by volume decline. Net sales were up slightly and included a benefit from slightly favorable currency. Operating profit grew 7% primarily driven by growth profit margin expansion as funding the growth savings and increased pricing and offset higher cost. In the U.S., our strong growth in online indust was more than offset by weakness in the pet facility channel. We continue to expand our online availability in the U.S. and our e-commerce growth in the quarter and the year was very strong. We are also seeing significant growth in our online business in Europe, where e-commerce is an even bigger piece of the pet utility category. Developing market volumes were up nicely driven by Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic + Mobility and Metabolic + Urinary, Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet Derm Defense and Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet z/d. That's it for the divisions, and with that I'm going to turn it over to Ian who has some thoughts on our 2017 outlook. Ian? Ian Cook : Thanks, John. And good morning everyone and let me wish you all a happy and healthy 2017. What I'd like to accomplish this morning is two things. 1) Reflect a little bit on 2016 and 2) then talk more specifically about our plans for 2017 in the context of the fourth quarter we have just completed. I think it is safe to say that 2016 has been a year of growing uncertainty filled with unpredictable and disruptive events, especially in the fourth quarter when we saw significant foreign exchange volatility following the U.S. elections, the unexpected demonetization activity in India and category slowdown in several of our key markets. Against that I would say, overall for 2016, we delivered solid performance overall. Topline organic sales growth up 4%, broadly healthy market shares as John has exampled in his remarks good gross margin progress up 160 basis points to 60.3% and just over 3.1 billion net operating cash flow up 7%. As we move into 2017, I think it's safe to say that the uncertainty continues and indeed there is likelihood of more events unpredicted occurring as the year unfolds. So how are we planning for 2017 in the context of how we ended 2016 in the fourth quarter? From a high level point of view, I think we feel confident that the strategy we have been deploying for over a decade, a strategy that focuses on engaging with consumers developing a steady stream of innovation for those consumers focusing on the efficiencies that allow us to fund our growth and perhaps most importantly continuing to develop a cadre of talented leaders that we can deploy around the world to keep focusing on winning on the ground. Secondly I would say that our discipline and focus on the fundamentals has served us well and will continue to serve us well. And my third point for 2017 would be that our over arching priority and objective focused against growth. So coming back to the categories as I mentioned categories and several key markets slowed in the fourth quarter and we are now seeing growth in our categories across each of them major geographies that take the following shape. For North America we are seeing our categories grow around 2%. In Europe we are seeing in aggregate categories basically flat. And for our emerging markets we continue to see categories growth of mid single digits casted closely around 5%. so with that as a context of our consumers behavior the organic sales growth plan that we have for 2017 sees us targeting the low end about 4% to 7% point organic growth range. The growth we deliver in 2017 is expected to rely on less pricing with a sharpened focused on profitable volume growth for the full year starting in quarter one. And from an organic sales point of view we expect to see sequential improvement in quarter one. The innovation pipeline that John talked to remains as robust as ever. We continue to invest in the capabilities that we need to serve new consumers and new places think e-commerce and as we said in the press release strong advertising support will be behind our brands and the innovation and I will return to that in a short while. Now it's unusual for us to get country a specific data and detail but I think in a circumstances in the fourth quarter we feel it's important to clear on the understanding of why we have confidence in the growth for 2017. So let me offer a few comments by each of the divisions related to the organic sales growth that we are targeting for 2017 and let me start with Asia. As John said the demonetization in India was indeed unexpected and that saw a high single digit organic sales growth business become in the quarter a double digit decline organic business. In fact, excluding India the division would have seen positive organic sales growth. So as we look forward into 2017 from that unexpected event we were pleased in the fourth quarter with the sequential progress we made in China and the return to volume growth we expect that sequential progress to continue in china and we expect the recovery in India to build across the first half. For Africa-Eurasia, the actions we took against a selected number of distributors are behind us and the division would have seen positive organic sales growth without those actions. And we expect to see positive progress, inorganic sales beginning in the first quarter in that division. In Europe, the decline traces largely to France and in France we saw strong category declines in the fourth quarter both in volumes and in value and the subsidiary in France in developing stronger plans that are being put in place with key customers to help drive category growth and our growth alongside the category. In North America we also saw a slowdown in the category growth rates and consumer consumption and this was the one division we saw increased promotional activity which we are meeting in 2017. For Hills as John said, we posted strong e-commerce progress indeed our e-commerce growth in the United States with Hills was up from 60% our market share on e-commerce is higher than African motor share and we expect that growth as we expand e-commerce distribution to continue in 2017. That was more of an offset though by the weakness in the pet specialty category which again is being addressed by strengthened programs in partnership with the principal retailers there and the focuses as John said on channel mix. And finally, Latin America although we expect to see continued growth in 2017. Now I mentioned the strong innovation pipeline. I mentioned the capabilities that we are investing in to reach consumers in new places. But I would like to return to advertising and make a couple of comments. Number one, we will continue with our focus on customer marketing activities in store that can and do build categories and we are deploying that indeed as we speak. But turning to the traditional below the line advertising in our 2017 plan our advertising is up absolutely and as a percent to sales. It\u2019s advertising that is increasingly digital and mobile and we have planned for continuity of advertising across the year. The advertising will be behind the innovation that we have, the strong brand equities that we possess India for example Colgate was rated one more time the most trusted brand in the country and we will also have advertising focus behind the community programs that Colgate does in many countries. The turn off the tap type of advertising the scholarship program, advertising and advertising that relates to the school\u2019s programs that we have around the world. These are all proven vehicles to build the brand awareness, brand loyalty and induce trial. And we are substantially increasing our sampling in 2017 to further drive trial of the strong innovation we have. Now for 2017, we are obsessive about protecting those investments. A sudden change in foreign exchange can put pressure on short term results given the lead lag of actions to offset the impact of that foreign exchange. We are not going to reduce our investments in advertising to deliver a quarterly number. What we are going to do is to focus relentlessly across all lines of the income statement on productivity. Our funding to growth program is as vibrant as ever and we will receive sharp focus. As John said, we will redouble our efforts behind structural cost reduction in this last year of the global growth and efficiency program and we will from a category, a product and indeed the channel mix perspective focus on the premiumization that can be delivered with the consumer. And from material cost point of view, the environment is relatively benign in 2017 with material cost estimated to be flat to modestly up with a little bit of pressure in fats and oils but a relatively muted landscape. So with that focus and with that landscape we expect our gross margin to be up at the high end of our 75 to 125 basis points range. Tax rate for 2017 is assumed to be in the 31% to 32% range obviously any changes to tax policy from the new administration is not included in that estimate. We have obviously run many different scenarios, we are as informed on the matter as you are and obviously if anything firm arises we will inform you. I think I would say that we are certainly looking at tax holistically or the different tax policies that maybe adopted, and if one uses holistically we would expect it to be a net benefit but again our current tax rates of 31% to 32% doesn't include any assumed benefit. So to summarize our plan will see us growing at the low end about 4% to 7% organic sales range with sequential improvement beginning in quarter one. For 2017, its growth with less pricing and a sharper focus on profitable volume growth. It's growth supported by innovation, it's growth supported by investment and capability and it's growth supported by advertising that is up absolutely and as a percent to sales and planned for continuity. And of course we have the clear focus on the ground plans and executional discipline to help accelerate that growth and that is our primary focus in 2017. Gross margin as I said at the high end of our 75 to 125 basis points range strong net operating cash flow expected as you have seen in the release earnings per share of low single digits in dollar terms and an absolute focus by folk in our company on delivering the growth across 2017. So those were mine prepared remarks and now we would be delighted to open the call to questions. Hello? Operator : [Operator Instruction] We will go first to Caroline Levy of CLSA Americas LLC. Caroline Levy : Thank you very much. Could you just quickly tell us what your thinking is on the currency hit to EBIT and earnings and then as I always do ask, Ian if you could talk a little bit about the climate in China and Brazil those two countries which seems to, Brazil seem to deteriorated meaningfully for the first time for you China the bricks and motor business maybe has deteriorated as well, so if could just touch on those two that would be great? Ian Cook : Yes I think, the foreign exchange from a ForEx point of view when I was estimating it was about 3% obviously the bottom line impact is more so the change from the guidance we provided, preliminary guidance we provided before entering our budgeting process is really composed of two factors. One is the foreign exchange and the second is based on the assumptions I just went through the fact that we have recognized slow market growth into our planning for next year. Turning to China and Brazil, I would say two cases, Brazil is indeed in challenging economic times as John said overall in Latin America we have been very pleased with our performance. We note that several companies have been negative on Brazil I think half of you would be our market shares continue to be strong in that country and indeed growing as John said. We have taken pricing necessary to offset foreign exchange in part and we have seen some slow down in category growth with negative volumes from time to time. So we are just going to keep focusing on growing our market shares in Brazil and overall in Latin America expect a healthy business there to continue. Regarding China again we were pleased that the fourth quarter show us make sequential improvement which had been our plan. We were particularly pleased to see volume growth come back positive. Our market shares are holding well. You are correct that our e-commerce business has loads of potential. We grew dramatically in China. We have a completely standalone team that focuses on driving that business in China. But we do have opportunity to increase our market share further because in China our market share is not in line with our brick and motor share yet on e-commerce so that gives us plenty of opportunity to grow. So, we remain I must say overall very committed to the emerging markets. We see a strong consumer base there. We have strong brand loyalty there and we continue to see good opportunity for growth there. Caroline Levy : Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Wendy Nicholson of Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, good morning. My first question is really just the follow-up I mean when you talked us in late October it didn't sound like the world is falling off as much as it clearly did for your business and other than the India demonetization which is an extraordinary event, I am surprised things all decelerated as they did. So I guess my first question is on with your guidance to planning to see sequential improvement in 2017 what\u2019s your confidence kind of where we are set here end of January that the first quarter will impact show an improvement from 1.5% and then kind of tucked on to that and sorry for the long question but Colgate has long had this 4% to 7% organic growth target and you haven't been there for a while and I am just wondering if it's time to look at that reset that at least take maybe six and seven part of that guidance off the table and if you were to do that would you be able to take another hard look at your cost structure and maybe have another restructuring program? Thanks. Ian Cook : Good. Well thanks for the question Wendy. Yes, we feel confident in sequential improvement which is why we say it and why we went through the divisions making the comments we have made. And you are right that we\u2019re a collection evidence that impacted us in the fourth quarter one has to say that the foreign exchange aspect of things was a surprise to most surely, the India demonetization was a surprise but what gives us confidence are the reasons I have laid out in my prepared remarks in terms of we understood what needed to be addressed. We are in the process of addressing them. And therefore, the plan we have is precisely that wondered sees us sequentially improving in the first quarter and sees us driving full growth at the low end of that 4% to 7% range. Another restructuring Wendy I think the way I would rather comment that is understand the intensity behind the language when we say that we are going to be relentless in driving the last year of our current restructuring program which clearly focuses on structural cost and as again we have said in a world that is slowing even more that it had. So, we recognize the challenge and we are being and will continue to be relentless on taking advantage of the opportunity of this last year of the restructuring program to address that structural cost. Wendy Nicholson : And when you think about what happened in the fourth quarter, sort of the zigs and zags, I mean, one of the markets that I think is most interesting to me is France, not that it's all that large or what but not it strikes me as a very stable market generally and for it to turn negative in terms of category growth surprises me and I just wonder maybe on forgetting history and developed markets have always been so economically sensitive when it comes to toothpaste. But can you make any comments on that whether that is \"Oh yes, not a surprise\" or \"Oh yes, that's kind of something new and different that we haven\u2019t seen before?\" Ian Cook : Well clearly, France category is turning negative was not a pleasant or expected event. I think there is public information out there that says that some retailers in France have suffered from the same problem which is to say consumer purchasing weakness in France. So, you're certainly seeing deflation in France and indeed in some categories, volume reduction. So, the focus has to be to right that with your customer partners on two things. 1) Is innovation that is price accretive, so that you can grow the category volume and hopefully the volume and 2) the brand marketing and in-store customer marketing to drive consumption at the retail level? So, the sharpness of the slowdown was a surprise. Wendy Nicholson : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Ian Cook : Hi, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : Hi, how are you? Ian Cook : Wonderful. Dara Mohsenian : It sounds like guidance for 2017 assumes a lower level of pricing growth. I'm just trying to get a sense of you expecting a significant change in pricing, obviously you mentioned North America, but are there any issues with price gaps in other regions and then we talk to more about tweaks to promotional levels or could there be less price changes. And then the second part of that is you also mentioned higher marketing spending in 2017, how comfortable are you that you get a tangible topline payback from the higher marketing as well as the incremental promotion given it seems like from an industry perspective the volume payback in those areas is less than it's been historically recently. Thanks. Ian Cook : Okay, Dara. Well, so on pricing, when we talk SPI selling price increases, we simply had in our plan less pricing and because commodity pressures are more benign and transaction impact have lessened. A large part of that pricing is indeed carryover pricing from year-to-year. When you talk promotion and tweaking promotional level that has been for us largely in North America where we did see stepped up promotional activity in the fourth quarter and we have made some pricing gap adjustments in China on our business which has returned us to the volume growth, which we plan to build on in 2017. But beyond that, I would also know broad scale observation. On marketing spend, again the focus here is growth. We have like everybody else, return on investment model. I think when you talk about in-store activity or shorter marketing if you will, you're talking more about what can you do to induce purchase of higher priced products with less reliance on price at retails. So, I think that needs to be the focus rather than diminishing return. And on the advertising side of things, given the strength of our advertising, of our brand and given the strength of their innovation, we see that it's a very good return particularly with the effectiveness of advertising but I tried to elude to earlier and the continuity of advertising overtime. And of course, from an e-commerce point-of-view that has very good return and from a digital marketing point-of-view that has very good return as well. So, we're quite comfortable with the return side of things, I think what one has to try and guard against is a devolution into zero sum promotion pricing, so we're reaching where we need to but it's certainly not something we're looking to leap. Dara Mohsenian : Great, thanks. Ian Cook : Good, Dara. Operator : We'll go next to Stephen Powers of UBS. Stephen Powers : Great, thanks. First just a follow-up on France. I know you said that the category slowdowns in that market at least on toothpaste according to the Nielsen data that I'm looking at. This is appear more company specific than category? I think Nielsen has Colgate volumes down 30% December period relative to flat for the category with Unilever, Glaxo and Han hold the beneficiary. So, just some more commentary on that will be great. And like a tuck on, a forward looking question. I know, John cited category dissolvation and dissolvations and effects really explain the lower EPS outlook. But I was somewhat surprised not to hear elevated competition in that algorithm as well. So, just any thoughts there would be appreciated because your gross margin outlook doesn't apply significant competitive pressure either. So, again just your outlook on a competitor pressure and how that changed all since your October outlook. Thanks. Ian Cook : Yes. First let's start with the comment on France. And I was trying to be shall we say broad based in my remarks earlier. The fact of the matter is we have had an issue with a retailer in the French environment which is resolved and will see us back where we were before in the first half of the year. So, that's the specificity to the Colgate aspect of France, but it takes nothing away from the fact that on the other categories, the category declines were sharp and meaningful. But on the Colgate brand specifically, there was a customer issue which is now being addressed in a mutually exemptible fashion and we'll see business trading return to normal in the first half of this year. Now, as we got competitive pressure, the one that we have spilled out is frankly the only one that we see between beyond what has been normative in our markets and that is in North America and that is one that we have stepped up to address within our planning guidelines for 2017. Hello? Stephen Powers : Oh, that's great. I didn\u2019t know my, I didn\u2019t know it's still opened. Thank you very much for that. If I am open, could I just have you comment on the tax scenarios that you had run and just the range of impact that your scenarios point to? Ian Cook : Yes. I'm not open, Steve. Stephen Powers : Okay. Ian Cook : No. The answer would be, I don\u2019t think that's time well spent, which is why we try to frame our comments in the holistic sense. I mean, nothing is firm, you all know what the range is out there are and that's why we try to give the headline that from a holistic point-of-view, plus minus we would expect the net benefit to be favorable. And really I think that's enough to say at this stage. Stephen Powers : Alright thank you very much. Operator : We will go next to Ali Dibadj of Sanford Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : So, I guess the stock reaction would suggest that there is still a debate about what you are saying and kind of brief in acceleration and what I am really hearing from investors just to going some of the previous question is that investor really want to understand and to figurate your top line organic slowdown and expect acceleration further than they have done so far. So just thinking on that a little bit can you tell us kind of what your precise number what percentage of deceleration category in yours would you attribute to macro versus kind of one time like in France versus competition and if you say the bulk is not competition like I think you did to seize the question. Second ago I would want to know that the list of countries you are losing share has grown so Mexico, India, China, France, U.K. now over the years it's definitely grown and as you look forward what you are expecting to change from either macro or competition or one time to see the top line acceleration or is it really just your own activities to improve and get deceleration? Ian Cook : Yes, I mean just aggregating all of that, I mean particularly the competitive activity piece is almost impossible. And in fact, we don't break it down that way. So the largest change that shapes our top-line projection for 2017 was the reduction on category growth, the lessening in category growth that we are seeing that we have simply re-planned against and we see our top-line growing for the reasons I have said. When you come to the competitive activities the kind of shares you are talking about is I mean take Mexico which I think John talked to our share is about 81 and in the prior it was just over 81 that's on a value basis. Our market shares in general Ali, if you go through them if there are slippages they are quite modest slippages and they are not accelerating in any way with the exception of the French matter on Colgate that I just described. So I mean what we think will build our business is innovation, is the advertising that we are committing to including the in-store advertising but with a commitment to the brand advertising and the manner that I have described. A focus on the fundamentals that at retail and I think from a competitive activity point of view we will be responsive where we need to be responsive from a competitive point of view but we don't want to do it in a zero sum game fashion. Ali Dibadj : So that's helpful. Thank you. The reason I am well maybe what\u2019s behind kind of the question I had got a little bit is that if you really been able to leverage even the lower end of the 4% to 7% organic sales growth target that you have been delivering, question for the past few years the lower end of that, into double digit EPS growth ex-currencies. But for 2017 it's surely doesn't seem like that is something you are able to do suggesting you are going to have to spend more back and I am trying to kind of get underneath that in terms of but you\u2019re not getting those details for this year but your top-line is roughly you are saying what it's going to be well what it has been so you are spending more back why? Right so is it that you are feeling when I\u2019m buying on China being more aggressive Procter or PATANJALI whoever have you lost a little bit of the mojo, like why are you spending more back if it's not competition I guess what I am trying to get at? A \u2013 Ian Cook : I guess the answer would be and I think what we are beginning to see through this earning cycle is that growth in many places has indeed slowed further. And so, what we are saying is what is a reasonable growth objective in uncertain times and how do we ensure that we build our brands to deliver that growth at this unique point in time. And so, we are saying I mean I think the gross margin expansion is quite strong. I think from a top-line point of view organic sales growth at the low end of our range will certainly put us in a good comparison group and the focus on the restructuring that I mentioned earlier and further driving down on structural cost will equip us to be leaner going forward if this rate of growth in the will doesn't reaccelerate and so I am saying we are saying that we think it is right at this point in time to overweight focus on growth and but it is growth of our businesses at a time when sure all competitors are looking to do the same thing in a slowing world everyone is still looking to grow. So from the big picture point of view it's always a competitive environment what I am trying to delineate against is we believe in the quality of our innovation to drive our business against competitors when I talk promotion it's more in-store pricing promotion which we would rather put against trial for new innovation but we will be competitive where we need to be competitive and I think that's the year we are looking at. Ali Dibadj : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : We will go next to Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yes. Thanks and good morning. The question is on category growth. So can you give any context of clarity on in fact what\u2019s driving some of the down drop in the category growth? Is this trade down? Is this frequency? Is it inventory outside of obviously which you talked about South Africa? Any context around that would be really helpful? Ian Cook : Yes. I think there are few elements to this. And it's not a generalized statement for the world. Obviously, there are \u2013 there in some parts of the world particularly Europe deflation as pricing comes down to stimulate volume in some categories we have seen that for several years and that remains unabated. From a consumer behavior point of view, they don't go away from the behavior of brushing their teeth. They will exhaust pantry inventories so which is to say people have more than one toothpaste at home they may try and scratch that tube before they reload their own pantry. There is as we have seen sort of a subtle inventory correlation to a slowdown in categories. So these are all components factors I mean from the pent off study Colgate is in two thirds of the households on the planet and we are very disciplined and very focused on in making sure our in-home penetration stays that elevated levels. So if there is any sort term slowdown from a volume point of view due to pantry destocking in the like that will bounce back afterwards. So, I wouldn't point to anything Nik that says there is down the line behavioral change here that is of concern. Operator : We will go to our next question from William Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz : Hi, good morning. Ian Cook : Hi Bill. William Schmitz : Can you just bridge the gap between the old sort of 10% local currency EPX as growth to five because maybe a point of it is some sort of category growth but where is the other 4% shortfall coming from the follow-up? Ian Cook : It\u2019s foreign exchange Bill, I mean the two principal elements are now this is against the preliminary guidance we gave in October to where we are now so it is simply the foreign exchange and the lower category growth which is reflected in our growth target for the year. It's those two things. William Schmitz : I thought before 10% local currency growth and it seems like the implied guidance now is 5% local currency growth. Am I incorrect? Ian Cook : No. No. sorry I was misunderstanding. no. no. the implied currency guidance is 5% and that is structurally driven by the income statement I mean the growth we have the margin expansion and the investment we choose to make behind the business. William Schmitz : Okay. Was it not 10% before? Am I off? I thought it was like you thought 10% local currency was the right number and now it's five. Ian Cook : Yes. It was 10% in -- now. And we are saying that the two differences are foreign exchange and volume. Operator : We will take our next question from Olivia Tong of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : Thanks. So, on the advertising margin change because is your view to get back to sort of a historical levels about 100 basis points higher as a percentage of sales and where you said now because assuming there isn't something really different below the line it would seem to suggest the fairly move upwards in operating expense to our outlook, your EPS outlook and then on the other hand it turns out that you need to spend more to drive top-line improvement how willing are you to do that if it does end up impacting EPS? Ian Cook : I think for 2017 we have stepped up our advertising quite meaningfully from 2016 and we believe in uncertain time with clearly slowing category growth with the innovation pipeline we have it is to our advantage in 2017 to invest that advertising deliver that growth and keep consumers with our brands. So we think it's a good level Olivia I mean we have planned due diligently and we are very satisfied with the advertising level we have as I said it includes a sharp uptake in sampling as well. And these are all into the programs that we have on the ground behind brands and the new products that we have. So we think the plan holistically is an appropriate plan for 2017. Operator : We will go to next to Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning. Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions. First on Hill, some work around the channel it looks as we have been hearing anyways that at least one of your brands has been dealers in yield one maybe fall through as a major specialty channel but also hearing that there is some innovation on the pipeline potentially so any comment you could make around the Hill business as it relates to that new products or just progress there I would appreciate it. Secondly, in India I know great business for you historically you mentioned the behavior doesn't really change and it's quite a bit of inventory in anybody pantry of Colgate product. Does this mean that you are going to restock in India and you get better performance at this point in the next six months? Thank you very much. Ian Cook : On your second point, I would love to think so Jonathan but I wouldn't count on it. The purpose we have in India right now is simply rebuilding the pipeline over the first half of the year if we get a rebound then wonderful. On the Hill let me sort of paint a broader context here. The strategic decision that we have taken based on consumer behavior is to keep our brands specialty which is obviously a brick and motor channel and go where our consumers are going and our consumers are going e-commerce. And they are going to the traditional places you would expect, the Amazons and the [indiscernible] of this world and their rate of adaption of buying our products on e-commerce is very elevated so we are moving there. The brick and motor retailers that you principal pet specialty retailers we have not been delisted from either retailer. We have good plans with one and we are in discussion with the other and the one short term difficulty we have with the second retailer is that our shelf location and the number of SKUs we have in the store have been both reduced and moved to another position. And we believe that we can together develop a win, win solution for that to rebuild the business in the brick and motor at the same time as we are driving it online and on Hills innovation we have considerable innovation in Hill's for confidentiality reasons I prefer not to talk about it but that's the story on Hills in the U.S. John. Operator : We will go to next to Lauren Rae Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Thanks. Good morning. Ian Cook : Good morning Lauren. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Two things one was just on the two and half things the conversation around category growth, Ian it was great when you walk through kind of your outlook by broad region but I am not sure with the changes like you asset to Europe at flattish number market of 5 kind of feel like where we have been so I am just curious what\u2019s change. Second thing was on the build from kind of double-digit in dollars to lose single digit in dollar for EPS, Fx and volume, is it more pricing because I am hard pressed to think that you were previously forecasting volume growth as six and now it's four given you said it's going to be more volume than price leading so it is your outlook on pricing perhaps has changed more than volume. And then, finally just SG&A was actually up quite a bit and I was just curious on the percentage of sales, given your commentary on focused on restructuring and taking cost out was there anything particular in the quarter on SG&A to be mindful of? Thanks. Ian Cook : Yes. So on the category growth yes it has changed actually Lauren. In the U.S. we were seeing two to three and you may remember me commenting I was getting widely exuberant that it was moving to three so that has now come down by a percentage point. Europe was always flat to modestly up. The range of Europe is now negative to modestly up therefore flat overall. And in the emerging markets well I used to talk mid single digits the reason I talked 5% now is the single included a number with a six in front of it and that is now off the table. So those shifts are real and that is what is build into our planning. So, if I go back on your second point if I go back to our planning, indeed is it is all volume because pricing is more or less at the same level we had in the original plans slightly higher in fact. So it's all volume. And then, finally your point on SG&A up that's still a leverage. So deleverage rather the actually a dollar overhead is down but with the impact on the top-line and the amount of dollar denominated over, we have we don't benefit from a ratio basis which is why we talked about relentlessly focusing on our cost structure in this last year of the restructure, I think those two or three questions. Operator : We will go to next to Jason Gere of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jason Gere : Okay. Thanks. I will just make this really quick. I guess first just in terms of the re-acceleration on the volume. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how excited you are about some of the innovation coming out? I know there is innovation every year but certainly with this kind of 1.5% volume which in the third quarter put aside challenges of the fourth quarter but sounds like you are getting back to 3% range. How much of this can you contribute to really the innovation the step up innovation what\u2019s coming out with obviously giving away any trade secrets and then the second question just on pricing being just a small contributor this year can you just talk maybe about where you are still taking pricing? I know a lot of it is roll over from last year, maybe how we should think about Latin America contributing versus where you are still going to have price investment such as Europe so obviously the two will offset each other just on the grey. Thanks. Ian Cook : Yes. The trouble is that Jason, if I was to display enthusiasm you wouldn't notice the difference. So in terms of volume acceleration re-acceleration part of it is building back from the onetime events that we mentioned. So that\u2019s an important part of it and the strengthened plans we have in place as I detailed earlier and innovation is the strong part of it. We tend to be fairly low key in terms of talking about innovation and I plan to continue that tradition but John mentioned some I would just say we have a broad array of good innovation and we will be driving that starting in the first quarter across the year but I wouldn't lay innovation as the out-sized re-accelerate growth in the first quarter. It will part of it but it certainly won\u2019t be all of it and on pricing I mean I think the way you should think about it is that in the main, much about pricing has been to offset the transaction impact of foreign exchange and therefore you can assume that the pricing taken or being deployed now is in regions that says face those kinds of challenges but I repeat our focus for 2017 is on growth and our focus within growth is on profitable volume growth. Jason Gere : Great. Thank you. Operator : We will go to next to Linda Bolton Weiser of B. Riley. Linda Bolton Weiser : Yes. Thanks. I just had a question of on the pet care area. Can you just explain why the e-commerce penetration is higher in Europe? Is it just as the brick and motor is less developed there or is there an actual difference in how consumers are approaching the market? And then, secondly can you explain if does the trend towards immunization, is it disconnected from the general economic strength and high consumer confidence like in the U.S. in the pet care or is it actually linked to it? So as the economy strengthens is it actually easier to get premiumization or get consumers interested in spending more on their pets in the U.S.? Thanks. Ian Cook : Yes. Frankly Europe and I don't mean anything political by this, Europe is a smaller geography than the U.S. and more urbanized and when you think of the literal volume of those bags the convenience factor for e-commerce in Europe is much higher for the consumer and that is the big driver of why the adaption for bulky products is so high. And premiumization look people pay for value and what they perceive as value is not just price. And therefore, and we have said this before the reason your focus is on innovation is to create value that the consumer believes is good value even if the price is a premium price to what he or she may otherwise buy. Operator : We will go next to Stephanie Benjamin of SunTrust Investment Bank. Stephanie Benjamin : Hi, this is actually Stephanie on for Bill Chapel, just a quick question. Do you really expect any impact to your pet veterinary business from the recent mars acquisition of BCA? Thanks. Ian Cook : I think the short answer is no. You may know that Mars also own another group called Banfield we have very strong shares in both BCA and Banfield with that Hill's business Mars have said, they\u2019ve owned Banfield for coming on a decade Mars have said that they will let BCA run as an independent group and you should know for BCA pet nutrition products are about 5% of their sales. So that's not really their business. So the headline answer would be no. Operator : We will go next to Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Thanks. And good afternoon guys. I wanted to ask about growth by category sort of a different way versus what we were talking about from country standpoint. Anything notable specific to home care, personal care, oral care in terms of your own expectations and perhaps even so how are you thinking about that now versus maybe three to six months ago and then just quickly on something different expectations for spend in EPS. How are you thinking about the assumptions for category and competition meaning your expectations for the increased ads spend out in the percent of sales, is that assume the competition is greater than equal or less than where you were in 2016 will be helpful? Ian Cook : Yes. In terms of your spending question I mean that's a very complicated question. We build spend based on what we see by market from competitors. Now these days you don't see everything because some of the online spending is not tracked. So there is an estimated components of it. And so you structure the spend to be adequately competitive. I am not talking the traditional advertising spend. And as I have said we plan it then to be continuous for the year behind innovation, behind the brand and sometimes behind our community programs where you see the greatest short term changes and I commented on North America is more in promotion than in the traditional advertising. So, we have built a plan for 2017 that we think is adequately competitive and strong enough to drive the innovation we have and the brand equity is that we have around the world. Now when you get into categories we have a very clear strategic view which doesn't change depending on what happens in a quarter. So our strategic view is that we focus in order of priority behind oral care, pet nutrition, personal care, and home care in that order. That has been our focus because of the continuing underlying growth rates of the categories even if they slowed and because of the margin profile of each of the businesses. So our category decisions strategically are informed by the categories not by quarterly events. Operator : We will go next to Jason English of Goldman Sachs & Co. Jason English : Hey guys thanks for squeezing me in. Ian Cook : Hi Jason. Jason English : Happy Friday to you.. Quick question on the Africa-Eurasia distributor I thought you had to work through I apologize I missed in prepared remarks but I don't think I heard a lot of detail. Can you walk us through what happened there? And then second question is on capital allocation. Your share repurchase activity was a bit less \u2013 a bit more this past year. You are sitting on more cash than usually and you are \u2013 Ian Cook : Let me talk again about Africa-Eurasia. It was distributor issues with a select number small number of distributors. It had to do with liquidity because cash liquidity because of foreign exchange moves and it was moving business away from distributors and indeed bringing back some inventory. I guess the tailing point about we made in our prepared remarks was that the division growth would have been positive from an organic sales point of view without that event and that we expect organic sales progress to recommence in the first quarter of 2017. Relative to capital allocation it our current thinking going into the year is that our share repurchase will be broadly in-line with the share repurchase since we made in 2016. Operator : At this time we have no further questions. A - Ian Cook : Okay. Well good afternoon to everyone and to any of the Colgate people listening we are in the first quarter. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation.",

Welcome to today's Colgate-Palmolive Company First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings release and the most recent form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, also available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables eight and nine of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead. John Faucher - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Thank you, Sherlon. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO, Dennis Hickey, CFO, Victoria Dolan, Chief Transformation Officer and Corporate Controller, and Elaine Paik, Vice President and Treasurer. This morning, I will start off with some general commentary on the quarter, will then go into further detail on the divisional performance, and I will finish up with some color on our outlook for the rest of 2017. As Ian said in the Press Release, Q1 was challenging, and from an organic sales perspective it fell sort of our expectations. Overall, we saw continuation of the sluggish market environment we highlighted on our 2016 year-end conference call. Several of the issues we highlighted on our call in January improved as expected, including the impact of the Indian demonetization. That said we did see some additional headwinds this quarter, which I will detail as with we go through the divisions. Despite these headwinds, there were several positives in the quarter, particularly in terms of earnings growth, gross margin expansion, and operating cash flow growth. Taking a brief run through the P&L, our net sales were flat in the quarter with organic sales up 0.5%. Our sales growth continues to be led by Latin America, which saw 9% net sales growth and 7.5% organic sales growth in the quarter. Organic sales growth in emerging markets was 3%. Organic sales were down 2.5% in developed markets. Volume was down for the quarter offset by positive pricing. Our gross margin expansion continued in Q1 on top of strong expansion in 2016. Our gross profit margin expanded 50 basis points on a GAAP basis and 70 basis points excluding charges from the 2012 Restructuring Program. We saw solid benefits from pricing and Funding the Growth. Our advertising spend in the quarter increased 1% on a dollar basis and was flat as a percentage of sales against our strongest advertising quarter last year. Versus our full year 2016 advertising to sales ratio, our advertising to sales ratio in the first quarter 2017 was up 120 basis points worldwide with an increase across every single division. We still expect advertising spending to be up year-over-year on both a dollar basis and as a percentage of sales for full year 2017. Given that Q1 was a high quarter mark for our advertising to sales ratio in 2016, the year-over-year increase in 2017 will be more weighted towards the balance of the year. On a GAAP basis, we delivered high single digit EPS growth. Excluding charges resulting from the 2012 Restructuring Program in both periods, our diluted earnings per share in the first quarter 2017 was $0.67, an increase of 6% versus first quarter 2016. Cash flow performance was very strong in the quarter driven primarily by our growth in net income and continued improvement in our working capital performance, particularly on receivables and inventories. Over the course of the quarter, we reduced both our receivables and our inventories by more than one day versus Q1 2016. Our operating cash flow was up 13% year-over-year, while our free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx grew by 14%. We returned $678 million to shareholders in the quarter through share repurchases and dividends. This was almost a 20% increase versus Q1 2016. And now we'll move to the divisions. We'll start off with North America. As other consumer product companies have said, Q1 was a difficult quarter in North America. In particular, we experienced challenges in our hand dish business and saw consumption weaken across the vast majority of our categories, particularly in the United States. Combined with inventory reductions in retail, this led to a 5% decline in net sales and a 5.5% decline in organic sales. Volume was down 5% in the quarter with pricing down 0.5%. A restaging of our hand dish line led to some market share losses in the quarter. This restaging involved switching out SKUs which temporary limits our ability to promote the brands and has led to an increase in competitive activity and market share erosion. We believe this transition, which is almost complete in the mass channel and will be complete in the food channel in the second quarter, positions the hand dish business well for future growth through increased shelf space and more effective consumer promotion. With the completion of the reset later this quarter, and new advertising already in the market, we think this business is well positioned to rebuild market share. On the rest of our U.S. businesses, our market share performance has generally improved sequentially over the course of the first quarter after a drop in late Q4. In particular, we have seen sequential improvement in our oral care share performance in the United States. The sequential improvement in our toothpaste share performance has been aided by continued growth in our premium portfolio. Tom's of Maine continues to gain share. Our Q1 launch of Colgate Optic White Radiant in the U.S. which is being supported with the robust integrated marketing campaign including significant TV and digital advertising support, has also aided our share performance. We also launched Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Smart White in Canada another premium offering. The toothpaste category in North America and around the world continues to premiumize, and we are seeing success with innovation at higher price points. Year-to-date our mouth rinse market shares are up year-over-year driven by the Q1 launch of Colgate Total Advanced Health Mouthwash. When a consumer shakes the bottle, they combine the freshening and germ killing layers to reduce 24 times more bacteria than ordinary non antibacterial mouthwashes. Now we'll look at Latin America. Latin America continued to be a key driver of our growth in our portfolio, both on an organic sales and a net sales basis. Our net sales growth of 9% was driven predominantly by pricing, as volume was flat and foreign exchange provided a 2% tailwind. We continue to see growth in volume in Mexico driven by strong share gains in toothpaste. Year-to-date our Mexican market share in toothpaste is up more than 200 basis points to 82%. We have seen share growth across most of our toothpaste brands led by Colgate MaxFresh, Colgate Triple Action Extra Whitening and Colgate Anticavity. Mexico has also seen strong share gains in mouth rinse and bar soap. In Brazil, we maintained our leadership in the toothpaste category during the quarter with our year-to-date market share of 72.1%. Share performance was more mixed across the rest of Latin America. However, we expect this to improve going forward. We have several new product launches scheduled for the second quarter and we believe this additional activity along with our increased advertising investment year-over-year should result in more consistent share gains. Now we'll move to Europe. We are hardened by the sequential improvement in our volume and organic sales performance in Europe this quarter versus Q4 2016 which came despite some continued impact from our distribution issue in France. Europe net sales were down 5% in the quarter with organic sales down 0.5% and a 4.5 percentage point impact from foreign exchange. This represents an acceleration of 300 basis points on an organic basis versus Q4, driven by improvement in volume trends as volume was up 0.5% in the quarter versus negative 2% in Q4 2016. Net sales trends improved by 250 basis points sequentially as the improvement in volume was offset by slightly greater negative impact from foreign exchange. Encouragingly, for the quarter we saw sequential improvement in the UK and France from Q4 2016. Our volume in the UK was up nicely, and we improved our pricing on our base toothpaste business. In France, as expected, our business is still down year-over-year, but the rate of decline has lessened. As we discussed on our last call, we experienced the loss of some distribution in France. We began shipping again to that customer during Q1 and this should help improve our sales trends in France over the balance of the year. We also recently launched the Colgate Naturals oral care line in France. This product sells at a notable premium to the rest of our portfolio, which allows us to generate positive mix. We will be launching the Colgate Natural Extracts line in other European markets later this year. Other first half launches for the European division include Colgate Enamel Strength toothpaste, the Colgate 360\u00b0 Advanced Toothbrush line and the restage of our Sanex Zero% line. Now Asia-Pacific. Net sales in Asia-Pacific were down 3% year-over-year driven mostly by the negative impact of foreign exchange. On an organic basis, sales were down 1%, a modest improvement versus Q4. For the quarter, volume was down 1% and pricing was flat. The primary challenge in this region was weakness in our China business where we saw significantly greater than expected retailer destocking due to the continued category shift from brick-and-mortar retail to e-commerce. While brick and mortar market shares in China were down year-over-year, we continue to see significant share gains online in China. This quarter we achieved e-commerce share leadership in China behind the Colgate and Darlie brands. Going forward, we also expect to benefit in China from the national launch of our Colgate Naturals oral care line, which Ian talked about at CAGNY. We conducted a test launch of this product in one retailer to validate the brand positioning and size of the opportunity. Based on the positive response to this test, we believe we have a premium concept that works and that we can roll out throughout China. Our Indian subsidiary has seen signs of recovery from the impact of the liquidity crunch in Q4. Urban consumption is back to normal. Rural consumption is still reflecting some lag effect as the wholesale channel has not completely bounced back. The Philippines also posted volume growth in Q1. Our toothpaste market share was up to 63% year-to-date, plus 110 basis points driven by market share gains on Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Sensitive. Along with the Colgate Naturals launch in China, Asia-Pacific should benefit from continued rollout of Colgate Total Pro-Breath Health toothpaste and Colgate SlimSoft Advanced toothbrush. Africa/Eurasia. The Africa/Eurasia division showed notable improvement in Q1. Our year-over-year growth in net sales, organic sales and operating profit all accelerated sequentially from Q4 2016 despite the continued impact from the distributor changes in our Sub-Saharan African business. The sequential improvement in volume performance was driven by South Africa and the North Africa/Middle East region. We're encouraged by the results from our new price tiering strategy on our base toothpaste brands in South Africa, which allows us to maintain household penetration, drive revenue growth and generate additional funds for advertising, all while driving margin expansion. Our advertising spending in Africa/Eurasia nearly doubled year-over-year in the quarter on a dollar basis. A notable oral care new product in the Africa/Eurasia division for first half 2017 is Colgate Total Pro Visible Action toothpaste which is being launched across most of the division. On the Personal Care side we have launched Palmolive Luminous Oils shower gel. Both products will benefit from significant advertising support. And finally Hill's. Hill's delivered 0.5% net sales growth for the quarter, driven by favorable foreign exchange. On an organic basis sales were flat year-over-year as the decline in volumes was offset by favorable pricing. Volume in the U.S. was down, driven by continued weakness in the U.S. pet specialty channel. We are making progress in regaining shelf space and promotional activity in pet specialty and continue to expect improved performance as we further align our strategic priorities with our top accounts in this channel. Our e-commerce growth continues to outpace the category as our e-commerce business nearly doubled year-over-year in the first quarter. Also our Prescription Diet business in the U.S. is growing nicely, driven by strength in the vet channel. Outside the U.S. we saw organic growth in Europe driven by our online business and consumption is up across almost all of our European markets. Our emerging markets business saw strong growth in both net and organic sales in the quarter. Hill's should continue to benefit from the recent U.S. launch of Hill's Science Diet Youthful Vitality, which is specially formulated for dogs age seven years and older to help fight the effects of aging. And now we'll turn to our outlook for 2017. As stated in our press release, we maintained our guidance of flat EPS on a GAAP basis and low single digit EPS growth on a non-GAAP basis. However, given the organic sales weakness in Q1, we now expect organic sales growth will be modestly below our historical target of 4% to 7%. Based on current spot rates, we expect net sales to be up low-single digits for the year with a slight negative impact from foreign exchange. We still expect gross margin expansion at the high end of our 75 to 125 basis points long-term guidance range. We will continue our intense focus on productivity. We have a strong pipeline of Funding the Growth cost savings programs for 2017. Furthermore, in the last year of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, we continue to identify incremental opportunities to drive costs out of the organization. Our new organic sales outlook is based on an assumption that our category trends in the U.S. will improve versus Q1, but that growth will remain below the rates we saw in 2016. We expect sequential improvement in organic sales as we proceed through the year. There are several reasons why organic sales should improve as we go through the year. Our category growth rates in the U.S. have improved since the fall-off in February. We believe the performance of our U.S. hand dish business will improve as we finish the transition to our new SKUs. As we mentioned in the divisional sections, many of the headwinds that we saw in Q4 have lessened in Q1 and should be even less of an impact going forward. Our benefit from new products should accelerate as we deliver a broad array of innovation throughout the year, and the benefit from our additional sustained advertising investment. Finally, I have one housekeeping announcement. Due to scheduling conflicts, we will be issuing our Q2 earnings release and hosting our conference call earlier than normal this year. Our Q2 earnings release and conference call will be on July 21. Finally, let me clarify that the operator meant to refer to table 6 in our earnings press release in her opening statements. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Thanks, John. This is Ian. I thought that I would make a few summary comments on our position going forward specifically around top-line growth and I thought I might do that in a couple of ways. Obviously, when we provided our fourth quarter results, we identified some challenges that we were working through. And John has spoken to them, but I thought I would summarize them in one place and then comment further on the additional challenges we have faced this first quarter and why we expect to make the sequential progress that we have talked about. So if we go back to the challenges identified in the fourth quarter, the India demonetization, the consumption is clearly recovering and is expected to continue to strengthen across the balance of the year. In terms of France, the shipping has recommenced with that customer. In fact, we are already seeing a short-term market share uptick and, again, that redistribution should benefit our sales across the balance of the year. For our U.S. pet distribution, we are making good progress in regaining promotional activity across all of pet specialty, commencing in the second quarter and again expected to influence the balance of the year. And as John mentioned, e-commerce with that business continues to grow at an extremely strong rate, and pleasingly for us over half of the e-commerce business for Hill's is subscription which talks to the loyalty consumers have with that brand. And finally, the fourth, Africa/Eurasia, clearly we've seen notable improvement. The distributor changes are behind us although, of course, we will face that comparison through the third quarter of this year. And then turning to 2017, in the first quarter there are two I would talk to. Much of which has already been said relative to North America and more specifically the U.S. business around consumption weakness, particularly through February, the related trade inventory reductions and, in our case, some dish share loss related to our transition of the complete portfolio and vulnerability to some promotional activity that we were unable at the time to respond to. That transition will be complete in the second quarter with a more competitive product formulation, more competitive sizing and pricing, and trial-generating advertising and promotion is beginning. And so we think when the transition completes, we are well positioned to rebuild share. On our other businesses, as John commented, market shares have generally improved from the fourth quarter with specific improvement in oral care and category growth itself has improved since the decline in February. China, I guess a tale of two cities in a way. Continued strong focus on the high growth area, which is ecommerce and where we now have share leadership between the Colgate and Darlie brands. But as John commented, some short-term value share loss in the brick-and-mortar outlets. Now, as I have said before, if one takes the long view over the last eight years, our company market share is actually flat at around 32%, and it is the two other principle multi-nationals who have lost share to the local brands. But short-term we have seen a value share decline. Interestingly, our volume share in China, short-term, is up, and that talks to the opportunity with our new innovation Naturals at a premium price point in order that we could convert that leadership volume share into a higher value share with more premium innovation, which is where that local marketplace is going to. Moving beyond the specific challenges, we do have a full pipeline of new products, increasingly at premium price points, well validated by the consumers, and we do have increased sustained advertising investment levels up absolutely and as a percentage of sales for the year with the real year-on-year benefit unfolding as the year unfolds. And we know our business is responsive to that support. For the businesses where it matters, we have a relentless focus on growing share in e-commerce. We continue in the emerging markets to bring new users to the category and increase consumption with our 25 plus year commitment to oral care education. And we do have an opportunity that we are working hard to capitalize on of converting our volume share positions, which tend to be higher in market than our value share positions with the efforts we have behind revenue management. We have, as we always have, a very disciplined focus on cash flow and returns, well-spoken to by John. All I want to focus on is our particular focus on productivity. We were pleased with our gross margin expansion of 70 basis points in this quarter and we still are committed to our gross margin expanding at the high end of our 75 to 125 basis points for this year and we continue to work hard to identify incremental opportunities to drive cost out of the organization in this last year of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. So to summarize, we are guiding for accelerated top-line growth starting in quarter two and that is where we are focused, accelerating that top-line growth. As I have tried to summarize, we understand and are on top of the challenges we're working through and we do have a strong, well-funded plan for the balance of the year and we will bring absolute focus to the execution of that plan. So, Sherlon, that's my prepared thoughts and I would turn it back to you now to open the line to questions. Operator : We'll have our first question from Bonnie Herzog, Wells Fargo. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you, hello. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hey, Bonnie. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, I was hoping you could drill down a little further on the lower sales growth in North America and give us a sense of the magnitude of each of the issues you called out including your portfolio transitions in home care, retailer inventory reductions and the further slowdowns in the category growth. And then separately, would you say that the retailer inventory destocking in the U.S. remains a headwind or do you think things are improving on that front? And finally are you still seeing softness in the U.S. in April like Procter called out? Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Thank you for the one question, Bonnie. We're not going to drill down further into the U.S. business. We thought we were quite expansive in calling out the specific areas that affected that business, two of them much covered by external press as the quarter unfolded and indeed, as we indicated during our CAGNY remarks. I will say that the inventory reduction pressure seems to be behind us and have abated. As John commented in his remarks, we have seen improvement in category consumption since the fall off in February, and while we don't have complete data for the month of April, I would say that continues to be positive but not sequentially more positive than March. Operator : We'll go next to Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, Ian. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hey, Dara. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted to stick to the U.S. also for a minute and just kind of taking a step back and giving us some perspective or a bit of the state of the union on your view of volume trends here, more from an overall category perspective. It's just \u2013 it's pretty shocking to see a 5% volume drop for you guys and understanding some of the inventory cuts and consumer spendings muted, et cetera, all of those reasons, it's still worse than we even saw if you go back to the downturn in 2008/2009. And I don't think it's just you guys. Obviously, you can see it in the peer results, you can see it in the Nielsen data. So just any perspective on what's driving the volume weakness from a volume perspective? And you mentioned you think category growth improves in the balance of the year, but what gives you confidence behind that? And then second, just on a related note, how do you adjust your strategies in light of that? And it sounds like promotion and advertising was clearly a focus a few months ago, but doesn't seem to be paying off to the extent it typically has in the past. So how do you kind of adjust the Colgate playbook that served you so well in the last couple of decades within this tougher environment? Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah, I mean, that's a very deep and complex question, Dara. If you look at that first quarter, much has been said about weather. Much has been said about tax rebate checks and other external factors. From what we can see, with some retailers the tax rebate checks did seem to have an impact. And that is clearly behind us and hopefully will not reoccur next year, but we did indeed see volume decline in several categories and obviously, that is a concern going forward. As I said, we saw it pick up a little bit in March, continued to be better in April, although not at the March rate. We've been doing some custom work around the world, particularly in the toothpaste market to understand consumers' buying behavior and we're not seeing people stopping brushing their teeth. I guess, some of the data that is emerging, in some markets you have consumers who buy multiple packs of the product and store them in their bathroom and when times are uncertain work down their own bathroom inventory before they go back to buy at retail. Now, depending on the marketplace, the on average number of tubes in the home is around two, and with the purchase cycle you have on toothpaste that gives you confidence they're not stopping brushing. They're going to come back to reuse the product. So we think, turning back to the U.S., that it's a combination of the external factors, which are behind us, and the consumer in an uncertain time just working down that home inventory. But we're not seeing their brushing behavior change which, I think, is an important thing. And as John said, from a share point of view, the advertising and promotional activity we have had in the U.S. is producing results in terms of our market share growth as we came through the quarter. So we think that part of the go-to market is robust. It is our estimation that the consumer will come back to the marketplace because their fundamental behaviors have not changed. And I would say trial-oriented promotion is still important in terms of our innovation flow and even our base business. So I think what one has to guard against, consumers are clearly prepared for the right value they perceive in a brand to pay a premium price. And I think and we have said this before, pure price promotion toothpaste volume does not accomplish that objective over the long-term. So it still comes back to innovation and support behind the brand and the innovation over the medium term. Operator : We'll go next to Kevin Grundy, Jefferies. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, good morning. Ian, question on the gross margin guidance, which you guys are maintaining the high end of the 75 to 125 basis points, based on John's prepared remarks, but I guess a couple of observations. Number one, you came at the lower end in the first quarter and gross margin comps get a little bit more difficult. And then given the difficult trade environment which you guys are contending with, which shows up in gross to net, it would seem like that would be a part of the strategy to increase that sort of in the balance of the year. And understanding you guys have a strong history with Funding the Growth to offset some of this, can you help us understand that your ability to deliver on the high end, which would suggest sequential acceleration in gross margin improvement, particularly in this environment, which is very competitive, particularly in the U.S.? Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah, Kevin, sure. Let me do one piece of housekeeping as I go through this in terms of our gross margin for the first quarter and that is to give you the gross margin pricing roll forward on the year. So if we start with the prior year gross profit, which was 60%, we got a benefit from pricing of 90 basis points positive. So actually our pricing was up. We got a benefit from our Funding the Growth savings and our restructuring of 140 basis points exactly the same as the benefit we got in the previous year. Material prices were slightly more of a headwind in the first quarter than the fourth quarter or the prior year at 150 basis points. And then we had a modest 10 basis points negative of all other, which got you to the 70 basis points. So fundamentally, on that gross margin, the disproportionate year-on-year driver was negative material costs which traced largely to fats and oils, which went up sharply. And as you've probably been reading in the business press, the crop this year has been particularly strong. And we have seen fats and oils costs now coming down which will, of course, lessen the headwind of the material costs over the balance of the year, which will be favorable to us. And if foreign exchange stays where it is, we will have less of the transaction costs impact hitting us from a gross margin point of view. And as you know from our history, the benefit of our Funding the Growth tends to increase as the year progresses sequentially quarter-on-quarter. So that's how we're seeing it. It's still allowing us to be competitive. Interestingly, if you look at the pricing we have taken in the market over the years when foreign exchange was strongly negative, over the last four years of all of the markets in which we do business, the only two where the pricing we have taken is ahead of the CPI are Brazil and Argentina, which perhaps wouldn't surprise you. So we don't think we've stretched pricing too much and we have an adequacy of promotional and advertising activity over the balance of the year, I think, to stimulate our brands and hopefully categories. Operator : We'll go next to Steve Powers, UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. So I guess, taking a step back from the quarter for a moment, my question is really whether there's something bigger going on because it's very rare for Colgate to surprise so negatively on organic growth two quarters in a row. And obviously, as you say, you're not alone having heard from Kimberly-Clark, P&G and others. But some of the recent surprises do seem execution related, whether in France or Africa last quarter, pet before that, managing local competition and channel shifts in China, and now U.S. dish. So maybe a little more context around the U.S. dish surprise this quarter and why you didn't have more visibility to the sequential deceleration we're seeing today when you spoke to us at CAGNY and reiterated the intent to accelerate this quarter? But then more broadly, why should we not be more concerned only about Colgate's results, but of the state of the broader consumer goods industry? Because maybe this really does all blow over in the next few quarters as it seems like everyone is assuming, but for now this seems like an abnormally impaired operating environment even relative to the warnings we heard throughout the quarter. So a little bit on your situation specifically, but then your perspective on the broader industry would be great. Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah. I guess, as you might expect, I bristle at the concept of executional issues. I mean, the reason I tried to go through the fourth quarter challenges in summary form this call was to try and put that in some perspective. Frankly, well, India demonetization was an issue that affected everybody, clearly external. From the customer point of view, we had several things going on, including some fairly tough discussions. And we're very disciplined in terms of how we manage our trading terms in order that we maintain the value that is in our brands. And we're also very disciplined in executing to a strategy that we deem is serving the consumers that we ultimately serve. And in the pet nutrition business, that is the shift to ecommerce which we are committed to following. And in the European case, we wanted to be responsible about the trading terms for our brands. And we suffered in both cases. That has now dissipated but, candidly, faced with the same choices, we'd make the same decisions. So they were decisions rather than execution. Africa/Eurasia actually the same. We found the negative economic pressures in those countries put distributors under pressure and it forced us, from a credit point of view, to make a decision. And we did, and we are rebuilding from that. So I would put all of those in the context of decisions made with the exception of India demonetization. And candidly, faced with the same decisions we would make them again and maybe that's just in certain cases the trickle-down effect of the slowdown in world markets as it affects other partners that we work with. Two aspects of the U.S. relates to the consumer and external factors, that is the trade inventory and the consumption weakness. The dish share matter again is a judgment. When you make these portfolio changes and basically change all of the SKUs in your line, you are frozen out of promotional advertising because you have to lock pricing through the transition period, you know you're vulnerable to promotional activity. Frankly, the promotional activity was at a much higher level than we had estimated. We still believe that making that change was right because we have a more competitive offering on the shelf in a more competitive array of packages and price points by channels of trade. And we expect that refreshed portfolio to rebuild over the balance of the year. And China, our e-commerce position is good and our volume market share is fine. We just need to do more to leverage that volume share up and we hope the Naturals premium innovation with more to follow will be the key to doing that. I think the fundamental issue here, Steve, is what are the underlying growth rates in categories and how do companies capitalize on those growth rates. As John said, from a U.S. point of view, we're looking at recovery over the balance of the year but not to prior year level. So our plans consider a slightly slower curve of return. And in the international markets, we are still seeing mid-single digit growth even if it has been more pricing than volume driven at this time and would expect to see that shift a little bit. So we don't think the fundamentals of the business are broken. We aren't seeing consumers changing their behaviors fundamentally, so we think it's a case of working through the short-term and the buying behaviors will recover over the balance of the year. Operator : We'll go next to Faiza Alwy, Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, hi. Good morning. So, Ian, I just wanted to talk about, as you think about your algorithm going forward and the 4% to 7% sales growth, and then at the same time you look at your Funding the Growth savings. Do you think that you're doing too much with respect to Efficiency savings? And do you think there needs to be a step change in reinvestment, whether it's on the digital side or more investment in frontier markets sort of recognizing the reality of activism threats, et cetera. But do you think you need to sort of fundamentally rethink the algorithm? Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Well, thanks, Faiza. That's again a broad question. I must say we tend not to think in terms of algorithms. We tend to think more in terms of strategically growing the business and while the 4% to 7% remains our long-term strategic growth target, as we said in the press release, given the slow start to this year, we expect to be modestly below that range because of the factors affecting the first quarter. We agree your point that brands respond to and we think our brands respond to investment in innovation and in advertising support, and that's why we are so committed to make that investment sustainably over the balance of the year which will affect the year more as the year unfolds. We're very committed to that. We're committed to it digitally. We're committed to it in advertising. We're committed to it in research and development to create an underlying pipeline of innovation that can fuel the business. We're committed to it with the formation of commercial hubs, which in some cases is giving us more resources on the ground to build our brands that particularly applies from a selling capacity point of view in the emerging markets. So we're committed to making those investments. In some parts of the world where underlying growth rates are just slower and have been for several years, it is, I think, untenable to continue to operate the way you have because the business itself does not support the infrastructure servicing it. And we thought as we began our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, we had a wonderful opportunity to use the power of SAP, which drives all of our business to move this commercial hubbing idea, which we had 15 years of experience in very effectively in Central America, move the idea of shared services to service subsidiaries and free them up to operate on the ground. I would add, business service centers staffed by Colgate people, not outsourced, to make us more efficient and free up cost and free up funds to invest in the business. So I think we're very focused on this balance between how far can you go and what do you need to drive the business on the ground or to drive business digitally. And we certainly haven't shied away from any of those investments. So we agree your posture and we're working very hard to execute against precisely that. Operator : We'll go next to Jason Gere, KeyBanc. Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, thank you. I guess, maybe following up on that last question. Seeing the trends that you saw, I guess, in January and February and the guidance that you're providing, I guess, about advertising, I'm just wondering if there was any need to step up some of the, I guess I would say the SG&A investments in order to kind of drive, I guess, the back half type of growth whether did the advertising budget change a little bit more shift to digital. Any other investment capability investments such as addressing more on the online business versus the brick-and-mortar with the slowdown there. So just wondering, over the last couple of months has there been any type of step change in terms of how you're investing over maybe the next year or so. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Well, I would say, Jason, I think more reflective of underlying trends than necessarily January and February, we're definitely shifting more of our investment to digital, no question, and we have many, many good, in fact, terrific examples of that. And that will continue and in some markets, I mean Hill's, for example, it's a 100% of the investment. So we will continue to push digital from a social, consumer engagement point of view. We're driving e-commerce as fast as we can. We're staffing separate groups to do that. China, we're beginning to see the outcome of that in terms of market share leadership in that country on e-commerce. So step change not in response to January/February, step change in terms of last year to this year and continuing to revisit the balance as this year unfolds? Absolutely. Absolutely. Operator : We'll go next to Ali Dibadj, Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hey, Ali. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So remember when we all debated on these calls whether lowering advertising spend as a percent of sales and shifting much more to trade spend which has grown to about four times your advertising spend, and we were debating whether that would lead to slower growth in top-line and some market share issues, and I guess, I'm assuming you all remember that. In retrospect, do you think that had anything to do, has anything to do with the slowdowns you're seeing today in the top-line, especially when yes category growth has slowed? But there are some kind of dollar share loss challenges, market share kind of challenges out there that are persistent, whether it be Brazil, UK, France, maybe coming back giving Carrefour, or China, India, at least it's more challenging. Mexico, you've turned a little bit. So a little bit of the ad spend postmortem would be helpful. And then as it relates to that, last time you were kind enough to give category growth targets, so North America 2%, Europe flat and emerging markets 5%. Clearly that didn't play out for the quarter, but could you update those numbers as you look forward for the rest of the year? Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah, well, let me start with the second and in terms of the category growth. So for the emerging markets, in general, we're continuing to see mid-single digit category growth. And as I've said earlier, sometimes more weighted to price than to volume, but nonetheless in that mid-single digit range. As we have said before, the European environment is quite flat, and we would say 1% would be exciting for Europe. And I think, we've kept that generally flat view from a European point of view. I think, from a U.S. point of view, we had been in that 1% to 2% range for the U.S. business. And based on what we're seeing today, I think \u2013 before we were even thinking, gosh, we saw some months where it was moving beyond 2% and thought the exuberance of 3% might be on the cards, but I would say category growth in the U.S. you might expect to be to the lower end of that 1% to 2% range than beyond the higher end of the range. But we'll have to see how the year unfolds. On the advertising discussion, Ali, I don't buy that. We continue to invest intelligently at retail. We continue to find ways. I was just in Europe the other week and saw some interesting ways we leverage the dermatologists with promotional activity at retail in France. There are many ways today that you can structure programs that are brand-building, not simply trade spending to build your brands. I agree with you and I think we were clear that we did not want to find ourselves this year in the position of reducing our advertising investment, our below the line advertising investment when faced with some of the surprises everyone has felt from foreign exchange, and we have made that commitment, and we will stick to that commitment. And that's something that will guide us going forward. But I don't think the Colgate advertising stance has affected the category growths. The category growths are what the category growths are. Operator : We'll go next to Olivia Tong, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. First just one clarification. You mentioned both in the UK and Africa improving price on base toothpaste. Are you making any changes to opening price points in any other markets? And then just bringing the focus back to the U.S. and sort of the step change there. I guess for, not just you guys, but are you and quite frankly many of your peers just tapping the market in a way that worked for prior generations, but with millennials forming households and this generation that grew up, like, Googling to do their homework and consuming everything on their phones and iPads. They're just not shopping and consuming the same way that prior generations did, they don't hold as much inventory in their house. They don't need to do that anymore, because you just yell at Alexa when you need to replenish something and it comes to your door within two days. And that convenience matters more and maybe in-store promotion doesn't have the same lift that it used to. And if that's the case, how does it influence pack size and innovation? And do you think that the industry, including yourself, is doing enough, because every generation will have differences relative to the prior one, but it does feel like this one is more of a step change than in the past because we've talked about how the retailers are holding less inventory, but what about the consumer too are? And it's not just because times are tough right now. Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah, well, thanks Olivia. I'm going to go home tonight and ask Alexa for sequential organic growth in the quarter. That would be very helpful. But to take your two questions. The opening price point idea. I think the thinking here, Alexa is that \u2013 Alexa. The thinking here is that we have an opportunity, as John said, to convert our volume share into higher value and that has \u2013 there are two elements of strategy to that. One is innovation that the consumer values that carries a premium price point that helps shift the portfolio over time. The other is finding intelligent ways to group and tier brands in your base business to elevate value with pricing being a component of the value delivered. And yes, the two examples given are the U.K. and South Africa, but it is clearly something that we are considering more broadly than those two countries. On e-commerce, I don't think as you imply correctly that the sort of millennial effect or the new household effect relates to the first quarter category slowdown and this is highly variable around the world. I mean, you've got a situation in Latin America where I think it's over 40% of new parents are already millennials and frankly their shopping habits are not yet highly developed from a consumption point of view on the Internet, but they're heavily influenced by social engagement on the Internet. So we reach them disproportionately through social media, but they shop in the traditional outlets that perhaps even their parents shopped in, maybe some change from a physical location, but it's not yet Alexa online driven. In the U.S., there is more of that shift. We see it most markedly with Hill's, and we like that. I mean, frankly if 50% of our e-commerce business is subscription that attests to the strength of the brand. And when you get to that kind of relationship with consumers is does that require new packaging, et cetera? The answer is yes, it does, and we have a terrific example on Hill's with Amazon where we worked to reshape the packaging in terms of protecting the product. In terms of using recycled material in the packaging in terms of that outer case being recyclable, which is something that the average pet parent that buys Hill's is interested in because it shares their value set. And so yes, when we move down that path, we indeed do all of those things and we're pushing hard. We are the leading company in oral care online in the United States. So we're moving hard down that path but still, in aggregate, in our categories today, the Internet is not a significant part of the business, but we're well positioned to capitalize on it if that hits a tipping point just as we've capitalized on it in China where indeed it is growing much more quickly than it is in the U.S. So should that shift happen, I think we're putting the right resources in place to capitalize on it, but not a significant force yet. Operator : We'll go next to Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Thank you. I just want to follow up with the Chinese destocking. I was just hoping that \u2013 John mentioned that it was basically due to the shift to online. So I was hoping to see if you can give us any color on how that is evolving, and when do you think that would be behind us? Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah. The way we think about it, as I said our volume share is up a little bit in China, which is good. I would say one of the other benefits we have in China, we have a multinational brand and we have a Chinese brand and I think that helps our market position in China, and strengthens our view going forward. This shift to e-commerce is continuing at quite a clip. So our current view is that it's going to be a couple of quarters before that's completely resolved. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And on that, Ian, if you can comment. You said about the commentary that Ali had asked on the category growth and, Ian, out of the 5%, could you give us a sense of how you'd be seeing for emerging markets going forward? Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: I'm sorry, I missed the \u2013 emerging markets we did say 5%, yes. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : It's still 5%. I'm sorry, yeah. Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yes, yes, I said that. Yeah. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: I mean, mid-single digits around that 5%. Yeah. Operator : We'll go next to Jonathan Feeney, Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thanks very much. I guess it turns out a little bit of a follow-up on e-commerce and China. Can you tell us, Ian, if you can or give us a sense, how your volume share in e-commerce now compares to your volume share in brick-and-mortar. How is it different, like what's allowing you to gain share in e-commerce right now, like how are the competitive dynamics different, the things you have to do? And how does that market more broadly show us what development of e-commerce is going to look like in North America and Western Europe if it shows us anything at all? Thanks very much. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah, so the answer is we lead, but the leading share is below our brick-and-mortar share. That is often the case with e-commerce because e-commerce tends to carry a lot more brands in their list of offerings. So there's still opportunity to expand there. And my gosh, the what's different, I mean everything is different. I think the most fundamental way to say it is that you can't think of e-commerce as if it's a digital shelf. So you have to be focused on engaging with the consumer on the way to transacting with the consumer. And there are many cues to good engagement, including how you show the product, including how you promote the product, including the ratings behind the product. So there are lots of touch points on the way to converting that engagement to sale. There are price points that work. And so we have teams that focus on all of that. The good thing with e-commerce is you get a real data flow in terms of the purchasing behavior of the consumer and you can react in terms of the way you go to market and offer your product to that consumer. And we're always trading ideas between what is working in the United States and how is the Chinese e-commerce business unfolding. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : And Ian, when all's said and done, will e-commerce, will a fully developed or a largely developed market whether China or anyplace else in e-commerce, in your opinion, wind up. I mean, can it be a more profitable market for Colgate? Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: I would say the answer to that is yes. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Bill Chappell with SunTrust. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hey, Bill. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Ian, just a couple actually specific questions on the quarter. First on the hand dish issues in the quarter. I mean, was that a surprise? I imagine you've restaged products before and seen competitive pressure, so I'm just trying to understand what was the disconnect in the quarter from what you were expecting. And then also on pet, you'd talked about weakness or John talked about weakness in the pet channel. Was that largely just in line with the channel or were there still some carryover from the issues you've had specifically with the retailers and some of your brands? Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah, to answer the second first. Yes, there was the lingering overhang of the issue we talked about on the fourth quarter which, in thoughtful language, we tried to convey is in the process of being addressed and should start to see a benefit back as we move through the balance of the year. So the answer to that is yes. I guess what was surprising about \u2013 two things about hand dish. Number one, it is rare that we restage an entire portfolio. But we felt from a competitive point of view that we not only had to make and wanted to make formula improvements to our product, but we wanted to completely reshape the sizing and pricing to compete in the different retail outlets more effectively. And with major retailers, you're given one window a year to do that. So either you do all of it in one go or you do one bit this year and then the next bit a year later in which case the sizing and pricing wouldn't harmonize effectively. So we made the judgment call to do it all in one go. And I guess what surprised us was the intensity of professional reaction in that category. That category was actually down from a consumption point of view quite significantly, and the competitive reaction perhaps because of that decline was, I think, four times the normal level. And we were frozen on pricing because we were making the change, and so we took a disproportionate hit. Now, I think the thing here now is to look forward and say that reset is almost completed. We have a better product, better packaging and sizing and pricing portfolio on shelf, and we have the trial building advertising and promotion just commencing, so we're looking to recapture that share with a better offering as we go across the year. So I guess that's the answer. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Thank you for the color. Operator : We'll go next to Lauren Lieberman, Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hey, Lauren. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. So I want to ask a little bit actually about productivity. So what was in the press release, and I think in the prepared remarks you talked about the final year of the Global Growth and Efficiency plan. You're looking for further opportunities. I wanted to be clear if that was sort of further opportunities in the confines of that program end this year, or if that's also about looking forward as to what comes next and just some broad thoughts around opportunities to bring down SG&A levels? Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Thanks, Lauren. Yeah, I would sort of come at that from where you ended rather than where you started. I think what we are focused on is incremental opportunities to address SG&A, and obviously we would like that to impact the business consistent with our current Global Growth and Efficiency Program timing. If that intense focus reveals future opportunities that we should consider, then we will clearly do that and be transparent about that at the appropriate time, but it is really a sharp focus on how can we meaningfully impact within the confines of the current program. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, Ian, does that mean that this year the outlook is dependent on coming up with more SG&A programs to fund the advertising you already are planning on doing? Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Absolutely not. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Or no. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right, so I want to be clear on is that that this year context and looking to do more. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah, in other words, this year context is looking to do more than is in our plan. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Sure. Operator : And we'll go next to Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks, and good afternoon everyone. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hey, Mark. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Wanted to ask about how you're thinking about monitoring responding to local competitors in key markets where, like, China you're seeing this becoming more of a source of competition. And then related to that, is there a category that as you look at those local competitors, you're more concerned about potential share change becoming better competitors. And it would seem from the outside looking in, it's oral care sort of the obvious one, so maybe you could talk about that a bit and sort of go from there? Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah, I would say many have mentioned this, local brands have become more of a factor. Their effectiveness actually varies market by market. We have a space in Latin America, and they have ebbed from the sort of five share points that they got to. I guess, China would be the most obvious and I tried to address that in my China comment, which is to say I think because we have a portfolio that includes both a, you might say, local brand and Colgate that we're quite well positioned there and indeed have opportunity to take premium up. The way to meet local brands, at least so far in our experience, is you have to cover their positioning. And in the case of many local brands around the world these days, indeed as we are doing with Tom's in the United States, but many of them attack the marketplace with a kind of a naturals view, so whether it's India or China or other parts of the world, we have some naturals innovation that we are bringing to the marketplace. It can be different market by market but the general idea is naturals and we think that is the weapon, remembering in China that Colgate has held share for the last eight years, that we think that kind of offering and shall we say China for Chinese advertising is the key to the local brand. So they will be there. Some have interesting concepts, and I guess the job of the marketer is to meet the interesting concept. And that's what we're trying to do. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Okay, so thank you. I understand that's the last question. Thank you for all of your questions and interest in the company. And Alexa, sell more. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com.  Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John. John Faucher : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO, Dennis Hickey, CFO, Victoria Dolan, Chief Transformation Officer and Corporate Controller, and Elaine Paik, Vice President and Treasurer. This conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC including our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings all available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables eight and nine of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Ian Cook : Good morning. This is Ian. I thought before John jumped into his customary division review, I'll just make a couple of opening comments. Suffice it to say as we said in the press release, this indeed was another challenging quarter and as I think we all know, the industry continues to face global market volatility and we have seen a further slowdown in consumer demand in several key markets, most especially the U.S. Southeast Asia and South Pacific. On the positive side, that pressure was offset someone by strong organic growth in Latin America with a good balance between price and volume and a return to positive organic sales growth at Hill's. My purpose in making the introductory comments now is to give you a sense of where we are focused going forward and going forward, we are focused, focused intensely on returning our business to growth over the balance of the year and improving bottom-line performance and our focus is heightened and will be heightened on four fundamentals. The first is increased advertising spending behind more impactful creative. The second innovation across our portfolio of businesses particularly, for personal care and oral care in the growing natural segment and especially naturals for toothpaste, which has a particular target of local brands in some key geographies in Eurasia and Asia. Third, greater investment behind our high growth eCommerce business and fourth, aggressively maximizing productivity up and down our income statement. Those are four fundamentals we are focusing on for the balance of the year and I be back later with more detail on each and turn the call back now to John to go through the discussion of the quarter, John. John Faucher : Thanks Ian. As Ian said in the press release, the second quarter was another challenging one. Net sales were down 0.5% in the quarter due to 1% pricing growth offset by 1% volume decline and slightly negative foreign exchange. Organic sales growth was flat year-over-year in the second quarter below our expectations. Our categories in the markets remain volatile as the macroeconomic picture remains mixed. We've seen a further slowdown in demand in several markets including the United States, Southeast Asia and South Pacific. Looking at the cadence of the quarter, after a weak April, we saw improvement in organic sales through the first half of June. The back half of June was however, negatively impacted by retailer destocking in some markets and a reduction in shipments in India in advance of the implication of the new Goods and Services Tax. As Ian mentioned in the press release, there were also several encouraging factors in the quarter as compared to the year ago. We saw strong sales growth in Latin America driven by a balance of volume and pricing and we saw a return to positive organic sales growth at Hill's following two weaker quarters. We're also encouraged that our foreign exchange headwind have lessened over the past several quarters and raw material costs are increasing at a more modest rate. We believe consumer usage of our products have remained broadly stable in the vast majority of market, which would be the basic category takeaway should normalize going forward. While we have seen a small decline in purchase frequency in some markets we're taking steps to adjust price point where necessary to spur consumption usage. While we're pleased with these bright spots, we're attacking the headwinds with a focus you would expect from our company and a strong sense of urgency. Through pricing and productivity, we achieved gross profit margin expansion in Q2 with 20 basis point of expansion on a GAAP basis and 50 basis points excluding the impact of our 2012 restructuring program. On a GAAP basis, our operating profit margin was down 230 basis points year-over-year in Q2. Excluding the impact of our 2012 restructuring program, our operating profit margin was down 10 basis points as the improvement in gross profit margin was more than offset by increased advertising investment, higher overhead expenses and other income expense net. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share of $0.59 was down 12% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of our 2012 restructuring program and a net benefit from a previously disclosed foreign tax matter in the second quarter of 2016, earnings per share was up 3%. We returned almost $1.6 billion to shareholders year-to-date through share repurchases and dividends. This is a 16% increase versus the first half of 2016. Now moving to the divisions. We'll start off with North America. In Q2 we saw improvement versus Q1 in both net sales growth and organic sales growth in North America, but not to the extent that we expected. Net sales and organic sales growth in the quarter were down 3.5%. Category growth rates in the U.S. slowed sequentially versus the first quarter, dipping slightly negative, driven by notable decline in April. May and June were better particularly May. In the toothpaste category, we strengthened our leadership in the U.S. where our market share lead versus our largest competitor increased again versus Q1 and now stands at more than one share point year to date. We continue to gain share in the ultra-premium whitening segment seeing benefit from our latest launch Colgate Optic White Beauty Radiant and Tom's of Maine Luminous White. Outside of oral care, our Tom's franchise also continues to gain share in underarm protection, tapping into the continued consumer interest in the natural space. Tom's has expanded it underarm protection line to now mentioned men's and children's variance as well. Turning to our hand dish category, while we saw sequential improvement in market share in the quarter versus Q1, the business is not yet where it needs to be. Our restage of the business is progressing slower than anticipated as it has been impacted by both category weakness and heightened competitive activity. The rollout of the new SKU is complete and we're adjusting our promotional strategy to compete more effectively on shelf. Now we'll look at Latin America. Latin America delivered 7% net sales growth and 8% operating profit growth. Organic sales growth was also at 7% as foreign exchange was even with the year ago period. Our strong gross profit growth in the quarter funded a significant year-over-year increase in advertising investment. We are encouraged that our volume performance improved across categories and geographies in the division. Our net and organic sales growth of 7% was driven by a mix of volume plus 2.5% and pricing plus 4.5%. While Mexico volumes were down slightly against difficult comparison, our two state market share in Mexico is up 170 basis points year-to-date versus year-to-date 2016 to 82.1%, our highest share in six years. We saw sequential improvement in our volume performance in Brazil, Columbia, Argentina and many other markets across the division. As I mentioned, we are encouraged by volume growth in Brazil, but the market remains volatile. We are managing our price points to ensure that we are competitive on shelf. Our toothpaste market share in Brazil remained at 72% in the quarter, even with Q1. Our Latin America business will benefit from several new product launches in Q3 including Colgate Triple Action Extra freshness toothpaste, Colgate Total Mouthwash and in Brazil, Protex Pro-Hidrata bar soap and body wash. Moving to Europe, Europe net sales were down 3.5% in the quarter with organic sales down 0.5% and similar to Q1 and a 3% negative impact from foreign exchange. Our U.K. business continues to perform well with a mix of pricing and volume growth, although this was offset by significant negative foreign-exchange impact, which should abate as we cycle easier foreign-exchange comparisons in the second half. Encouragingly, we saw a further improvement in our French business. Our oral care market shares are improving sequentially as we regained distribution and we would expect this trend to continue into the third and fourth quarters. Our Personal Care business in France saw strong growth behind the us and at zero relaunch this relaunch features new graphics and new product claims immediate investment for the Sanex Zero relaunch. This relaunch features new graphics and new product claims. The median investment for the Sanex Zero relaunch includes both TV and digital support that is tested well above advertising testing norms. Looking forward along the Sanex relaunch, we expect to see benefits from the launch of Colgate Max White Expert Complete Toothpaste, Colgate Minions License Battery Powered Toothbrush and the launch of Palmolive Naturals with precious oils. Next Asia Pacific, net sales in Asia Pacific were down 5% in the quarter and organic sales were down 3.5%. As mentioned in the press release, organic sales for the region came in softer than expected, primarily due to the reduction in shipments in India in advance of the new Goods and Services Tax or GST, increased competitive activity in Australia and consumption declines in Thailand. Volume was down 2% in the quarter, driven by declines in India, Australia and Thailand, with Greater China down modestly. Volume performance in India worsened sequentially in Q2 in advance of the implementation of the new Goods and Services Tax, which took effect on July 1. Due to uncertainty about the new law, the trade in India was cautious and shipments basically ground to a halt for the last two weeks of June. As I mentioned, our Greater China business posted a modest decline in volume in Q2, which was a sequential improvement from Q1. We are driving significant growth in eCommerce and as a company, we increased our industry-leading toothpaste market share in the quarter in this highly important channel. In the Philippines, we continue to see solid volume growth performance in market share gains across our oral care personal care portfolios. The Africa Eurasia division reported net sales growth of 1% in Q2, driven by price increases in foreign exchange, which more than offset weaker volumes. The volume weakness was driven primarily by the continued impact of our distributor changes and our sub-Saharan African business. We showed sequential improvement in volume in our Russian business in the quarter versus Q1, as we raised advertising spending and adjusted price points given some of the recent currency movements. Benefits from pricing and savings from our Funding the Growth initiatives allowed us to significantly increase our advertising investment in the division. We continue to invest in brand building activities, both in terms of increased television and digital advertising as well as programs to build per capita consumption to drive long-term changes in consumer behavior. Looking at the second half of the year, we expect the Africa Eurasia division to benefit from the launch of Colgate Ancient Secrets toothpaste in Russia. This premium price line uses locally gleaned insights to tap into the rapidly growing Premium Price Natural segment in the country. And we'll finish up with Hill's. Hill's delivered flat net sales for the second quarter as organic sales growth 0.5% was offset by slightly negative foreign-exchange. Volumes were down 1.5% with pricing up 2%. We are encouraged by an notable sequential improvement in volume trends in the United States versus Q1, driven by continued strength in our eCommerce business and greater availability in the pet specialty channel. We made significant progress in regaining distribution and promotional activity in the pet specialty channel in the quarter and we continue to expect improved performance as we further aligned our strategic priorities with our top accounts in this channel. Our eCommerce growth continues to outpace the category as our eCommerce business in the U.S. doubled year-over-year in the second quarter. Also, our Prescription Diet business in the U.S. is growing nicely, driven by strength into that channel. Hill's continues to benefit from the recent US launch of Hill's Science Diet Youthful Vitality, which is especially formulated for dogs aged seven years and older to help fight the effects of aging. It's gaining share in the aging dog segment, driven by a strong integrated marketing program that has driven 43 million impressions across all platforms, including some of the most impactful digital advertising we've ever seen on the Hill's brand. We continue to see significant opportunity to build the Hill's brand in emerging markets with a special pet food category remains underdeveloped. Our emerging markets business volume growth in the quarter was led by Mexico, Brazil, Russia and South Africa. Now we'll turn your outlook for 2017. As stated in our press release, we lowered our guidance of flat EPS on a GAAP basis to down mid-single digits on a GAAP basis. The change in our GAAP EPS guidance is due to the additional projects I meant -- is due to additional projects bringing our projecting charges for the global growth and efficiency program to the higher end of our previously disclosed guidance range. On a non-GAAP basis, our guidance remains for low single digit EPS growth. Based on current spot rates, we expect net sales to be up low single digits for the year with a slight negative impact from foreign exchange. However, given the organic sales weakness in the first half of the year we now expect organic sales growth will be in the low single-digits versus our previous guidance of modestly below our historical long-term range of 4% to 7%. We still expect solid gross margin expansion but we're now planning for gross margin to be up in the low end to midpoint of our 75 basis points to 125 basis points long-term guidance range versus at the high-end previously. Lower topline growth in certain higher raw material cost have impacted our year-to-date gross margin performance. We still expect gross margin expansion to accelerate in the second half of the year given less impacts from raw material costs and greater benefits from our Funding the Growth initiatives. And now I'll turn it back over to Ian. Ian Cook : Thanks John. So, let me come back to my introductory remarks and say that despite the recent category weaknesses we have seen, we believe a heightened focus on the full fundamentals I mentioned in essence, our focus on brand building and productivity will allow us to reaccelerate our top and bottom-line growth. So, let me talk a bit further about each of them in turn. The first one is you will remember increased advertising spend behind more impactful creative. So, we are as you know from the beginning of this year, committed to more consistent advertising investment sustained across the year with an increase on both a dollar basis and as a percentage of sales. The year-over-year increase in advertising investment is planned to accelerate in the second half as we lap lower levels of spending in the prior year. Obviously, part of this advertising will be digital, which is a growing percentage of our working media spend and when I talk about quality, we're talking about advertising that is tested to be motivating and persuasive with consumers using testing norms and what it sees is an increase in advertising behind what you might call the equity of the brand or the purpose of the brand advertising behind the base business sustained over time, while we use incremental advertising to launch new products. That the most immediate investment effect, but what I wouldn't want to forget is our increasing investment in building per capita consumption of toothpaste, which of course drives sustainable long-term growth, particularly for Latin America, Asia and Africa. Our Bright Smiles Bright Futures program is well on its way to reaching $1.3 billion children and teach them how to brush their teeth by target year of 2020 as you may recall, spending behind this program generates returns that are three times our return on traditional advertising and our analysis has shown that in our top markets outside the United States, 70% of our addressable population brushes their teeth on average less than one a day. The point being there is significant upside over time in consumption in oral care and so we are investing sustainably to generate that consumption over time. So, advertising for the near-term and advertising for the longer term. Secondly innovation, innovation of course across our portfolio for the balance of the year and into 2018, but innovation particularly in the Naturals space, which is a growing area of opportunity and further than that, specific innovation in the natural space for toothpaste, which is both an emerging segment and an effective counter we believe against local brands in Asia and Eurasia. Now on the natural side beyond oral care, John already spoke about progress with Tom's on UAP and obviously we broadened that Tom's range now into other personal care categories like body cleansing and bath soap. On toothpaste, we have launched the Colgate Naturals toothpaste line in several markets across three of our divisions and the rollout of that bundle will continue over the balance of the year, particularly across Asia. Our consumer innovation centers located in those geographies have allowed us to build bundles that are tailored to meet local needs and preferences, in other words a counter to the local brands we find in those geographies. I'm very encouraged by the initial results we're seeing. Now on top of that, as I have mentioned previously, in terms of regional brands, we continue to see benefit from underlying growth on brands like elmex and meridol in toothpaste in Europe, Darlie in China and Sanex in Europe. So that's the second. Innovation across the portfolio particularly focused on naturals and especially focused on naturals for toothpaste. The third is working with retailer partners full growth on our business and specifically greater investment behind the high growth eCommerce space. So, given the changes that we're seeing in the retail landscape, we continue to aggressively adapt our go-to-market execution to serve as the very different brick-and-mortar retailers growing in our categories today and of course e-Commerce. The focus nature of our portfolio and the industry-leading market shares that we have, make us relevant to the shoppers in those outlets and give us influence in our key categories and we of course are working very closely with our retail partners to help them drive traffic to their stores across all of the different segments of brick-and-mortar retail. Very importantly, we continue to build our capabilities in eCommerce and this I think is reflected in our leadership in toothpaste from an eCommerce point of view in our top markets, the United States, China and the U.K. and for Hill's as consumers increasingly move to online shopping we have the ability to reach an entirely new group of consumers and we make sure that our presence is structured to provide the information that pet owners need to make a smart decision about, which Hill's product is right for their pets. Interestingly year-to-date Colgate's worldwide eCommerce business growth is up 65%. So, an area of aggressive focus for the back half of the year and finally, the fourth aggressively maximizing productivity up and down the income statement. On the cost front, we are of course focused on realizing both short and long-term productivity in order to drive sustainable margin expansion funding the growth that you know well continues we believe to be a best-in-class productivity program that we used to work down cost on all lines of the income statement. In 2017 funding the growth is delivering significant saving in areas like ocean freight, direct and in direct procurement, co-packing and fragrance and formula harmonization. We're also tackling long-term cost structure through our Global Growth and Efficiency program. We'll continue to see benefits from our hubbing activity and our move to centralized Colgate business services and the back office services that they indeed provide and we have said consistently over the loft six to nine months that in this last year of our Global Growth and Efficiency program, we are being particularly focused to capitalize on the opportunity it affords us and so in the second quarter of this year, we initiated two additional projects as part of that program with the goal to better align our cost structure to longer-term trends. One, addresses the structure of our European business and one addresses our corporate infrastructure, both underway and these additional projects take us to the upper end of our previously disclosed cost and savings ranges and we continue to say that we remain very focused on identifying as many additional projects in the last year of this program. So those are the four areas of heightened focus; increased advertising spending behind stronger creative, innovation across the portfolio, particularly in Naturals and especially in Naturals on toothpaste against local brands, sharp focus with our retail partners and particular emphasis on the high growth eCommerce marketplace and continuing to aggressively maximizing productivity up and down our income statement with two new programs now public in this quarter just closed. So those are our areas of focus for the back half of the year and now I'd be delighted to open the line to questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] We'll go first to Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey. Good morning. Ian Cook : Good morning, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So, I am sure you guys are spending a lot of time analyzing the drivers behind the topline growth slowdown the last few quarters. My question is how much of the recent topline growth variance in the last few quarters versus your long-term forecast, how much of that do you think is due to factors that may linger longer term by consumer brand fragmentation away from leading brands that was sort of implied by your focus on natural and increased competitive environment or any other longer-term factors versus more of the shorter-term factors that mentioned and that's in both North America as well as emerging markets? And the background behind that is, is your long-term 4% to 7% organic sales growth outlook still reasonable? Why should we have faith in that given the magnitude of disappointment in the last few quarters, the fact that it sustained over a few quarter periods and has surprised you guys? Ian Cook : Yeah well, a lot in there Dara. First, I think as we -- as we came into this year and we've had the two quarters we have had, when we talked about the prior quarter the first quarter, we clearly said we would be below that range and now we are saying based on the first half performance that our growth this year will be low single digits. I would not offer a comment at this stage on the 4% to 7% range. I think that's something that we would come back and revisit once we gain more practical experience of how this year unfolds. I will say there have been a lot of one-time or at least volatile episodes in the last couple of quarters particularly late in the second quarter, which have been -- which have been problematic. And it would be fair to say that the continuing slow consumer demand is worrisome, but there's nothing that we see in the data that suggests that consumer behavior is changing in any way. As John said, we have seen pockets of length and frequency of purchase and we're addressing that both strategically with advertising and innovation and also some price point action on the shelf. The competitive environment is variable. It can be volatile and it can be particularly sharp and we saw that for example in June here in the United States across many categories, heightened, competitive activity. So, I think that's going to be a variable and our belief and I think the most important belief here is that the consumer behavior will see the categories come back. The only thing we can practically do to address that in the short term is to drive our market shares because then whatever the category growth is we will be getting the best return out of the category growth that exists. And in that regard, I can say that our global year-to-date market shares are better or even with the first quarter shares on all of our about priority businesses. So, we are beginning to see our market shares rise. But I think before one takes a view on longer-term growth rates, one would want to see this year play out and get more information on that consumer behavior, get some practical evidence that indeed the consumption patents do return to the norm. And then when we give guidance for 2018 that would be the time to have the conversation. Dara Mohsenian : Great. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Bonnie Herzog, Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Good morning. Hi, I just have a few questions on the stepped-up innovation that you discussed. First, could you give us a sense of the growth rates of the natural toothpaste category versus non? And then how much cannibalization are you anticipating of your exiting business from some of this new innovation? I guess I assume this is a premiumization opportunity. So, to some extent, cannibalization could be welcomed. And then finally, curious what you have innovated here earlier. Were you not sure of the growth of this emerging category would necessarily be sustainable, but now you are and I guess for me it's sort of begging the question, are there other emerging categories that are pressuring your existing business that you might need to move more aggressively in? Ian Cook : Yeah, well all good questions. It's suffice to say that the Natural segment is growing faster than the average growth of the category, which is what makes it attractive. We of course have participated in this segment for quite a while, particularly in markets where it's important Asia or even go back to now more than decade ago acquisition of Tom's of Maine here in the United States, which continues to grow very, very nicely. I guess the point is that the offering we are talking about now is different from the naturals offerings that we had thus far much more tailored to brands that now exist that didn't exist when we had our Naturals portfolio first in the marketplace competitive with those brands tailored from a flavor point of view and to the point you made at a meaningful premium price compared to prior offerings in the marketplace. So, it's more the tailoring of it than the existence of it because segments obviously more over time. So, I don't think it's a question of missed. I think it's a question of tailoring the product to the category as it evolves over time. And you know the question of cannibalization is a very difficult one to answer in the general. It varies market-by-market premiumization tends to reduce the cannibalization obviously with low businesses and we will of course be supporting our base businesses when we come with this premium innovations that we'll be working very hard to keep the cannibalization to a minimum, but regardless to the point you made from a cannibalization point of view this will be accretive from a pricing point of view and therefore favorable. Operator : We'll go next to Wendy Nicholson, Citi Research. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. Good morning. A couple things, first just to clarify, when you said your global eCommerce business was up 65% in the quarter, can you break out roughly how much of that was held versus for the core? And then just remind us off what base that is? Is global eCommerce still like 2% of your sales or is that number out to date? And then secondly, just kind of higher level, you talked a little bit in the prepared remarks about maybe taking some I think strategic pricing down a little bit in a couple of countries or categories and I wanted to go back to something that I had heard Noel talk about recently, which is a little bit more focused on raising pricing and revenue management and may be that Colgate's price points are below where the company would like them to be from a longer-term strategic perspective. So I get that you're doing things that are right tactical and strategic to recover some share, but how important is this concept of revenue management? How much it factors into your thinking of your growth algorithm going forward etcetera, etcetera, thanks? Ian Cook : Thanks Wendy. Well the eCommerce growth 65% is indeed for Colgate in totality. In other words, it is the Hill's business and it is all of the Colgate businesses and frankly we don't intend to break out the difference between the two, nor do we intend to break out the percentage of that business that is eCommerce suffice to say it is still relatively modest, but very, very high growth. And once it reaches a tipping point, we'll certainly bring that information to the marketplace. The pricing reaction is actually not mutually exclusive. When we talk about price point adjustment at retail it is to be competitive on purchase cycles and while it applies to all of our categories in promotional pricing, it is less focused on oral care, which of course is what Noel was talking about. So, they're selective, they're surgical and they're less focused on oral care point number one. Point number two, from an oral care point of view, just the prior discussion on the Naturals offering, we're also bringing innovation that is materially higher priced to that business and as Noel may have described, in some cases as we have relaunched literally tiers of our business, TIERS, of our business in different parts of the world behind that relaunch we found a way of elevating the value the consumer gets and the pricing of the line to increase the average life -- the average price of our entire portfolio. So, I guess that's the way to answer it and yes, revenue management is extremely important, the topic that Noel talked about remains highly relevant and what John was talking about was surgical activity less applicable to oral care on promotional pricing, not strategic pricing. Wendy Nicholson : Can you just put those two concepts together? I know you said consumer behavior vis-\u00e0-vis, the oral care category is really changing, but clearly consumer behavior with regard to eCommerce is changing a lot. So, if you think eCommerce plus pricing, in your analysis so far, if I'm buying toothpaste on Amazon as opposed to in Walgreens does the consumer tend to be more price-sensitive, more brand loyal, this is a high-level question you guys do such great job of analyzing the business. I am wondering if you have any kind of high level takeaways about how to make sure that your shares are as strong online as they are in brick-and-mortar, thanks? Ian Cook : Yes, interesting Wendy, it kind of works the other way. What we observe on eCommerce thus far is that the consumer is actually -- tends to buy more premium and even if they're not buying the premium brands, they tend to buy in multiples. So, in fact the eCommerce behavior is favorable to us from a consumption point of view and if you look at the Hill's business, 15% of the Hill's business in the U.S. on eCommerce is subscription. So that means once they buy it one time, they're signing up to regular delivery of that diet over time, which is we believe a good business model for our brand. Operator : We'll go next to Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, this is actually [indiscernible] on behalf of Jason. Thanks for the question. Gross margin improvement has been impressive in spite of a softer topline growth, but guidance for the full-year was brought down slightly in spite of a good faith run rate proceeding. Now is this mainly due to the higher expected reinvestment you plan to make in the second half and would those continue into 2018? Ian Cook : Yes, well thanks for the question, the gross profit as John said in his remarks was behind our expectations for the first half of this year, largely because of raw material cost increases, which in fact was primarily in the area of fats and oils. Interestingly, the cost of fats and oils has ebbed since the first half of this year. So as John also said, we now moving into a more favorable raw material cost environment and of course for this year thus far and it gets easier against our projections over the balance of the year there has been less transaction headwind because foreign exchange has not been so negative as it had been in -- as it had been in previous years. So, we are looking at what we believe will be a multiple benefit of material cost easing and transaction costs lessening and as John also said, we therefore expect to see a sequential improvement in gross margin as the year unfolds. So, I think that's the answer to the question. Operator : Our next question is from Stephen Powers, UBS. Stephen Powers : Great. Thanks. Ian Cook : Hi Steve. Stephen Powers : Hello a question to follow up on your advertising comments if I could historically if we go back your advertising was spread out pretty evenly quarter-to-quarter as a percentage of sales but over the last several years we've seen 200 basis point gap open up between first half spending and second half spending. And I know that directional you tend to close that just based on your comments but just say get back to 10% of sales in the back half which will still be 50 basis points slight of what I think you spent so far, this year that would imply 160 basis points of incremental spending in the back half than skew to Q4 if of my math is correct. I just love to get your sense if that\u2019s the right order of magnitude to be considering and then if so what kind of ROI do you expect that's going to have will it contribute to the second half topline improvement that you're expecting or should we not expect the list to really show through until fiscal 2018 perhaps that answer lies in how much spending goes to new launches versus the things like Bright Smiles, Bright Futures but just in the context to how you think about what the magnitude of increase spending and then the unexpected ROI and when you see it flowing through? Thanks. Ian Cook : Yes. Good question. And I'm glad you got the scale thing on the table you're right for the last couple of years and I think we were quite express about this when we talked about 2017 faced with sharp foreign exchange negative impacts and with having no immediate to place to go. We reduced advertising and we said coming into this year we did not want to do that and but even if foreign exchange were going to run sharply negative for whatever global calamity reason that we would not go back on our advertising investment. And our intention at the time we said that and it remains our intention and our plan is to continue our advertising investment in the second half at approximately the same level in other words sustained advertising that we have seen so far across the first half. And yes, that will suggest a fairly meaningful set up in advertising investment. We think the ROI will be good this is now talking to the traditional advertising because as I said earlier we have a lot of advertising vehicles now developed that have tested extremely well. So, we know the advertising works very, very hard and is persuasive to consumers and interestingly it is good to have this balance between announcing what new and shall we say supporting and reminding of the reason consumers give trust to the brand in the first place. And so continuous advertising behind as we call it the base is an important part of that decision. And you're right obviously the Bright Smiles, Bright Futures investment is not a short-term investment but is again I tried to spell out we know the ROI on that is terrific we know we get good ROI on our media in general. And therefore, we are very comfortable with the investment decision and of course it is our expectation that this will be part of the reason to return us to growth as we work our way across the year. And again, Bright Smiles, Bright Futures we hope will be part of the reason why we will be able to sustain that growth in the toothpaste category out of the time. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Jason Gere, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jason Gere : Okay thanks good morning guys I guess obviously what we\u2019re hearing the first half of the year pricing help to offset I guess the weaker volumes and the second half it sounds like volumes will probably offset price to get to that low single digit. So just wondering if you can just lay out maybe a little bit more some of the macro, micro impacts that you saw in the first half how that place in the second half so on the micro side talk about some of the distributor changes in Eurasia, the U.S. liquid I think in Europe there were some packaging changes. So, there were things that were within your control and I was just wondering how that plays out in the second half. And in the macro side I think you were talking \u2013 besides India and how that kind of plays on the second half I think you said that there was some destocking in the second half of June where that is and maybe a little more color so how we can think about that going forward? Thanks. Ian Cook : Good question Jason let me try and take it on. The U.S. dish reset, which I think we have well covered we now have the products fully in distribution there on the shelf where we want them on the shelf we were hit in June as we've said by heightened competitive activity very heightened. And we are responding to adjust our promotional planning on offering to jumpstart progress across the back half of the year. So yes, in our control and I think a plan in place to rebuild growth. On the decisions that affected customers I guess I would focus on of the three you raised you have decision to move broadly to e-commerce in the United States with our pet nutrition business which we continue to believe is absolutely the right decision. And we\u2019re in equal opportunity believer in that space in other words we are just as happy to lean in aggressively with the retailer who has a brick-and-mortar offering and an e-commerce offering as we are with the pure play eCommerce company. We had a hiccup shall we say with a customer in the U.S. that hiccup is now substantially behind us and a return to normal promotional and other consumer engagement activity is recommencing and will of course build across the balance of the year. The European retailer matter I think John covered well we are seeing our market shares rebound quite nicely and growing sustainably and sequentially and we expect to see that continue across the back half of the year. In Africa/Eurasia we made those distributor choices that we again believe are the right choices for the business over the long-term and we will continue to lap those comparisons until the fourth quarter of this year. So, the third quarter will still be burden by a difficult comparisons and then of course the reality is that even though each of them we believe was in the right decision they had a compounding effect all at the same time which was problematic but I think faced with the requirement to make the decisions again we make the same decisions. The GST you know we were just digging out of the demonetization headwind and then boom you get the GST which basically saw the stock list close up sharp the last two weeks in June and we're hopeful you know barring another event that we will see that rebuild across the back half of the year. So, I think on balance those issues I think we've identified them before and I think we are in the process of building them. The macro environment looking forward you know it really comes down to the categories we think the behavior will come back, but we're focused on building our market shares so that whatever the category growth rate is we're getting frankly more than our fair share of that underlying growth so that's the way we\u2019re thinking about that while we get more consumer data in terms of behavior as we work our way through the balance of the year. Operator : We\u2019ll go to Faiza Alwy, Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy : Yes hi, good morning I just had broader strategic question because I think if you look at some of the per capita consumption trends it seems like the opportunity is really in some of these frontier markets like in Africa and India which can be pretty volatile from a macro point of view and may be geopolitical point of view. So, are you thinking about extending -- using your distribution network globally and extending it into other categories so maybe skincare you have a great brand in Sanex may be taking that global or another brand or just extending your overall reach into just these global markets where you a great set up? Ian Cook : Yes, I think that's a very relevant and pertinent point and yes, of course it is within our strategic remit. It's not and I know you know this but it's not a simple as simply taking a product and putting it through a proven distribution system when you bring products the people may or may not be familiar with in their entirety i.e. from a usage point at all or certainly from a brand point of view it requires a considerable degree of investment and patients over multiple years to build a position in the marketplace. But the answer is yes, it is clearly one of the assets we believe we have that we can leverage the question will simply be timing and pace so watch this space. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Kevin Grundy, Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Ian Cook : Hi Kevin. Kevin Grundy : First question if you don\u2019t mind just a housekeeping one in the past you\u2019ve been kind enough to supply category growth rates by region U.S., Europe and EM so we get an update there. I think probably in aggregate category growth rates will probably come in about a point since 3Q but an update there will be helpful. And then the second question more broadly Ian would be around M&A and you talked a lot about areas of focus for the balance of the year which we well covered on this call so I appreciate that it's very clear. But the question is I guess given this sharp deceleration which we haven't seen your portfolio in a long, long time does this give you any pause with respect to M&A which is not been a big part of the company's portfolio strategy that's a nice tuck-in deals of course with Sanex and Hill's but said differently in a slower growth environment does this increase your appetite for M&A. And if so would you consider pursuing any businesses outside the current portfolio. Thank you. Ian Cook : Yes, well category growth -- frankly it\u2019s reasonably straightforward certainly for the last quarter the emerging markets are still mid-single-digits in some countries with much more of a presence now on e-commerce China would be the obvious example. And in the developed world what we have seen is a Europe and a United States or North America were essentially flat I mean that's the way the world splits today. M&A do we have appetite we've always had appetite we\u2019re just I would say very strategic in our appetites and when we look at M&A we look at it from the point of view of strengthening the portfolio of the company not meeting our sales requirement. And certainly not jumping into a new business that we don't know where too much about and mustard would have been a very expensive one to get into for example. So, I think you could see us buy on the fringes of the businesses we\u2019re in we have with Sanex for example you know lotions and creams that we are now expanding in Europe. But if we were to play an M&A and we are very keen on expanding our portfolio with the light asset I think you would see it in the broader definitions of the categories we\u2019re already in oral care, in pet nutrition and in personal care and that's the way we think about it we\u2019re not going to do anything in an undisciplined way adjust for a tactical response we remain king. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Andrea Teixeira, JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you hello good morning so can you elaborate more on your comment on the cadence of the quarter in North America and Asia it seems that June got worse from May and then the destocking was not only U.S. and China which obviously you mentioned in the last call as well as India. But I was just hoping to see if there is any other areas where you kind of recover from where we were in the first half. And if you can comment if orders are starting to come in faster now that we are probably six to eight months behind us in terms of the destocking mostly in the pantry and the retailer destocking. And related to that I mean in terms of the funding of your funding for growth you elaborate a lot on the sales perspective but is there anything that we can think of the SG&A I know you had invested a lot more in overhead over the past two months globally, but if you can elaborate if there is any other source of potential savings on that front that could allow you to continue to invest and faster further growth? Thank you. Ian Cook : Okay Andrea well let me start with the global growth and efficiency program and the SG&A idea I mean you were right we remain extremely focused on maximizing our opportunity in this final year of that program and I think you know that is reflected in the two actions that we talk about in the second quarter one of which reflected in the costs in our filing both of them are directly and meaningfully in the SG&A space. They will play out over time in terms of realizing the benefit that they will afford a benefit and we continue to focus on finding other areas that we could do like without in any way damaging the firepower we need to be successful on the ground. So yes, it's a very clear area focus and I think it evidenced in the actions that we took. It\u2019s very difficult to come back to this cadence on the quarter again as John said in the U.S. actually the second quarter in aggregate was worse than the first quarter overall with the combination of a weak April and then a June that faded. In terms of destocking we have seen that on volatile basis I guess the only thing I can repeat is that we are seeing on a year to-date basis our global market shares in our priority categories are better or flat with the first quarter which gives us a sense that our underlying consumption driven growth is improving and we look forward with the four areas of focus I mentioned to capitalizing on that fully as we work our way through the back half of the year. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Olivia Tong, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : Hey thanks I guess perhaps can we talk a little about just the aggregate impact of some of these one-offs, like the dish in the U.S., France, GST etcetera. Just trying to understand what you think your underlying growth would be if not for all these things because it's still probably not at the end -- at below end of your long-term range. And then also given these one-offs and recognizing the comp differential in Q3 versus Q4 in the second half I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color there. And then just on naturals we talked a lot about specific for naturals and oral care and that was very helpful, but one category where naturals has also been taken disproportionate share is pet food and we've talked about that in the past but just wondering can you talk about how you think about that category and the growth potential there and interest in standing in naturals and pet as well? Thank you so much. Ian Cook : Yes, well taking it in reverse order in pet we think about it more in terms of the formulation of our products we are unabashedly a brand that provides proven clinical benefits to pets whether it's preventative or whether it's curative with our prescription diet business. And certainly, on the preventative health line we have reformulated our products to put proteins first and not give people a reason to switch out of our business and if they value a particular clinical benefit to not have a barrier to them trying the Hill\u2019s the product and we think that has been quite successful and conceptually moving into a very, very almost homes like naturals is difficult to do. We have tried a couple of times with Hill\u2019s and the heritage of the brand doesn't give you the bandwidth to go pure on naturals. So, we've done it by formulation to eliminate barriers. I don't think at this stage given the compounding effect of the slowdown in our markets trying to do the math on what is the one-off and how does it relate to the underlying category growth is going to be particularly helpful because the expectation is that the category growth will come back. So, the reason the way we\u2019re thinking about it is to say over the year we expect this year now to be low single digits from an organic sales point of view and we continue to be very focused on the consumer and the consumer behavior. We've taken some actions that John mentioned to try and capture the frequency of purchase in some of our businesses and as we learn more will be able to respond more authoritatively is the behavior coming back or is there something else driving what we see in the categories and we think it would be premature and probably misleading to get into that at this stage. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Ali Dibadj, Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hi guys so I have two questions one question is when we talk about those initiatives and that you laid out so eloquently around naturals local competitors, e-commerce, more ad spend, better productivity or lower SG&A. These are all things you\u2019ve heard many of us kind of collectively push for and push you on the pass on these conference calls. I guess for a while I remember three years ago about eCommerce were only local competitors and all of us were kind of asking these questions ad spend has been an ongoing discussion. And now you're saying that we got to do something about these things. So, I guess my first question is I'm just wondering why it took so long to react what was turning point and now just still you\u2019re behind. So, I guess why it took so long. And the second question, I lay it aside if it's related or not I guess, but there's a lot of buzz out there right now a lot of discussion and I think your stock performance today given the numbers would suggest there is a lot discussion in investor community that the numbers today are so bad the number last quarter are so bad that they are actually good for shareholders and activists will come an acquirer will come in and get involved. What do you think about that view certainly helps your stock recently, but what do you think about that view and how hard will you work to specifically prevent a bid or an activist in that context so thanks for those two hopefully the focus questions? Ian Cook : Yes, I guess on the first question I'm not sure I completely agree I think it's fair the criticism on the advertising spend and the lack of consistency of advertising but that we addressed coming into this year's budget and I'm just reaffirming that it is playing out the way we expected it to play out. On eCommerce, we have been very focused on e-commerce for a long time we may not have talked about it as eloquently as you find I did this morning, but we have been focused on it and I think that's why we have the toothpaste leadership positions in the markets that we talk about and the growth rate. And subscription levels on the Hill\u2019s business that we talk about even if we took the pain of making those decisions in the marketplace which we\u2019re now after almost nine months nearly a year just working our way out of. Naturals again we had been talking about the naturals for a while yes, it's only coming to marketplace right now when the local brands idea came up we were saying that that is our response. You can try this on the speed of getting it to marketplace and I won't fight that but in terms of the idea and that was accounted to the local brands we feel good about the offering that we're on. And on the efficiency, I'm not sure you were implying any critique of the productivity and I think the action that we have taken in this quarter that we have mentioned was evidence of our focus in that area. So, when we think about going forward would buzz is one thing and there seems to be increasing buzz in this world about virtually everything which can become an enormous distraction. So, the only thing I can say and I won't repeat the remarks I made at Bernstein, but I will say we are focused on the areas that I have mentioned we think these are the right areas to focus on to see a recovery in sales momentum across the back half of the year. We are focused on the SG&A line in our income statement to get us more productive from a reasonably advantaged base going forward. So, we have no blinders in terms of a need to focus on our cost structure and we will continue to do that and if we have more to say in that space we will say that in a way that we think is consistent with driving growth sustainably over time. And with or without buzz we are steadfastly focused on that. So, I'm sorry I can\u2019t sound more energetic it seems to fail me, but I think you can rest assured but we don't have to rest assured I guess I'm saying that we very much our focused-on growth and on cost structure. Operator : Our next question is from Jonathan Feeney, Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : Hey and just thank you for your comment earlier about the focus on innovation to address yeah, the local brands and particularly in Asia and Eurasia I know it\u2019s other places, but you called out that specifically. And I'm trying to understand maybe why is it now versus any of the times in the past 10 or 20 years where you had really nice businesses in these places that local brands are gaining traction. And does it have to do with a change that is relevant to other markets is it technology driven and specifically does it have anything at all to do with I know it's some markets in Asia e-commerce is developed somewhat rapidly. Does the pressure that puts on your retailers and retail distribution have anything to do with the increase traction some of these local brand forms are having with consumers? Thanks very much. Ian Cook : Yeah, I think I don't think it's driven by e-commerce I think it's driven by shall we say business entrepreneurs who are local I think pleasingly for us it's driven by ideas that tend to be premium which are ideas we happy to compete with rather than perhaps in the early years ideas that were more pricing driven. In some cases, it's driven by affinities so the union by our brand in China was already a well-established wound healing brand in the country. You take it into the toothpaste category and say you stop bleeding gums well-known brand in the toothpaste category and they didn't do much advertising in the early years and the business started to grow. Patanjali in India takes a very nationalist view of his business so these are concepts in the local market. They tend to be premium price oriented and it means that you have to respond with a very specifically constructed offering that attacks the benefit the consumer is looking for. Hence the natural -- the natural reaction. So, I think it's more a function of entrepreneurs, concepts, affinity with the local, the market which is why we have innovation centers and technology centers in China to be close to the consumer on the ground in that country. And in the end, the winner over time in these clashes are going to be the companies that best understand the consumer and serve them offerings that they want over time and of course that's what we all resourced and focused on doing. Operator : We'll go next to Iain Simpson, SG. Iain Simpson : Thanks very much. Hello everyone. Couple of questions if I may, firstly just drilling down into advertising, this is a big picture stuff I guess. Your volumes are down 1.5% from the first half and that really does seem to imply very significantly with share loss. Yet your own -- your advertising is only up 10 Bps year-on-year and you're talking about marketing being about level in the second half as well. Is that enough up until 2014, your advertising was 10.5%, 11% of sales pretty much every year and recent years it's been more like 9% and 9.5% and we've seen your topline slow pretty meaningfully. So structurally where do you think advertising needs to get to medium term? And secondly, visibility on assets is pretty limited, but if you do get a big transactional FX tailwind be it in second half '17 or in 2018, what will you do with that? How much will you let through to the bottom line or will you reinvest it? What are the sort of key factors you'll look at; will you be in a position to make that decision? Thank you. Ian Cook : Well, let me start by saying you start with a great name, so that's a good place to start. Our point on advertising was not to do with the advertising in the first half. Our point on advertising and the numbers you referred to in the recent historical cost was to do with adjustments downward that we made in advertising in response to unfortunately foreign exchange very sharply going the other way, but your second question was suggesting And when came into this year, what we said was that isn\u2019t what we were going to do. Advertising North of 10% is a good level of advertising and so what we said coming into this year is that we wanted to sustain our advertising across the full year, which means the comparison over the last couple of years is driven by a lower second half in those prior years and what will be a sustainable level over the back half of the year, which means the advertising will be meaningfully up versus the prior year. So, it's sustainability rather than a lack of in terms of -- in terms of investment and hey foreign exchange, you look at the last five years, I think the pundits have been wrong coming into basically every single year and if foreign exchange does turn positive, we will have a quick round of the applause and then we will bring it back to the business. Our general historical rule of thumb has been to reinvest some and to bring some to the bottom line. What we would actually do this time around would be a subject of internal debate but that rule of thumb has been our historical action. Operator : We'll go next to Lauren Lieberman, Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Good morning. Okay. First is I have to ask the gross margin pressure as we won't have it is one. And secondly, maybe let's talk about Latin America for a second, where things turned very much for the better and I think about six to nine months ago now I got to spend some time with Thanos, and he talked about a broader innovation pipeline in Latin America where you were going to be bringing more news to lower priced tiers in your portfolio to giving the consumer more room to trade up at a lower level. And I was just wondering have some of that news flow started to hit the market because it was a pretty significant change in that volume, really dollar weighted volume metrics that we can talk a little bit about what's starting to work in Brazil that we've started particularly this term, thank you? Ian Cook : The gross profit roll forward, so prior year gross profit was $60.2. As you know we picked up 40 Bps from pricing between the restructuring, which is de minimis and funding the growth of positive 170 Bps, material negative 180 Bps, which was primarily the fats and oils as I said other 20 Bps and that takes you to the 60.7, which is up 50 basis points year-on-year. So that's the gross margin roll forward. I would say in Latin America it is a focus on the fundamentals. It is innovation. I wouldn't go so far as to say the lower end innovation is making the difference and I would say markets like Brazil. I'm afraid remain variable. So, we're very pleased with that bounce back, but we'll be watching very closely in terms of sustainability through the third quarter. But the fundamentals are the same fundamentals for Latin America across the back half of the year. Ian Cook : Okay. I understand that is the last call. So, thank you for being with us and we look forward to talking to you again in October. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

You'll remember, we called out four specific areas of focus : that we would increase our advertising spend behind more impactful, creative, and would be consistent in the way we deployed that spend; that we would continue to focus on innovation across our full portfolio of businesses, which you'll hear more from John in a little while, but with a special focus on Naturals in toothpaste as a way of countering some of the local brands in Asian and Eurasian markets; third, that we would continue to work with all of our retail partners to seek growth of category and our brands with a special focus on the high-growth e-commerce businesses, whether they be pure play or brick and click; and finally, and very importantly to us that we would aggressively work to maximize productivity up and down our income statement. I guess in summary that our focus was going to be on brand-building and productivity. So let me start with the advertising. We said we would increase our advertising and we would deploy it consistently across the year, and that would see an acceleration in the second half of 2017 given the comparisons to the second half of 2016, and indeed I think you've seen that in the press release that our advertising was increased quite substantially, and a growing percentage of that working media is going behind digital, between 20% and 25% globally, but of course there is a range in that, and in the case of Hill's for example, 100% of our consumer engagement spending is digital. We said that our advertising creative was beating testing norms and demonstrating that we have a broad array of work that is proven to create awareness and is motivating and persuasive against our brands. And we also said, and this has been the case, that our advertising would not just be focused behind innovation, but rather we would focus behind our brand equities, our core businesses, and these brand purpose models that we have been deploying, which give people something to buy into, not just something to buy, especially millennials. And all of that very much focused on the here and now, but we also reference the fact that we would continue to invest to build per capita consumption given the enormous opportunity that represents over the longer term in the emerging markets. So we have indeed invested and deployed our advertising the way we said we would. We think we're getting the beginnings of a return on that, and our advertising is focused not just on the near term, but with the consumption building on the long term as well. The second was innovation, and as I say, you'll hear from John about the broad array of innovation that is affecting our business in the second half, but I'd like to talk specifically on the Naturals innovation we have on our toothpaste business, as I said, combating the local brands, particularly in Asia and Eurasia. As we mentioned before, given that we have our innovation centers on the ground located in our divisions, this has allowed us to tailor our Naturals offerings against each of our major markets, so the interpretation of them has been different in, for example, India and China. The products have been launched, and they are proceeding on plan and building distribution in China and in India. And a third interpretation of Naturals was actually launched a little bit earlier in Russia where it was launched in July, and we actually have some very early share information from Russia. This is Nielsen so-called Scantrack data which focuses on the modern trade or about 60% of the overall Russian market, and the data shows that the Ancient Secrets interpretation of Naturals in Russia has built from July to a 2.7 share business, of which about a point and change of that has been incremental, actually more than that \u2013 the total share has gone up 4 points since July from 32% to 36.1% in that Scantrack data. So early days, our first share read, but an encouraging start with the Ancient Secrets in Russia and obviously considerable investment yet to come behind that innovation. We will have launched an interpretation of Naturals across all of our principal Asian markets by the end of the year, and in Eurasia, we will be fully launched across all of Central Asia by the beginning of the first quarter. So some good progress. You'll hear a little bit more about Naturals in Europe, but something early indications would suggest will be positive for us. The third, working with retail partners to drive profitable growth in all channels in which we compete, with a particular focus on e-commerce, whether it's pet specialty in the United States, cash-and-carry in Brazil, discounters in Europe, or mom-and-pops in India, or e-commerce everywhere, we're working with customers to grow our categories and our brands. To do that, we continue to invest in on-the-ground capability to manage with a separate income statement on e-commerce business and drive that e-commerce business, and we're using different approaches to capture the full potential of e-commerce. One example I would give of our different approach is a recent launch of Colgate Dare to Love toothpaste in China \u2013 yes, Colgate Dare to Love toothpaste in China, launched around, when else, Love Teeth Day, which we, of course, will sponsor forever. It's a national oral health awareness campaign held annually in China in September. The product was developed as a collaboration between our local Colgate China e-commerce team and one of our Chinese e-commerce partners. It is a pink toothpaste, very like our Max Fresh toothpaste, which has breath strips inside, except this toothpaste, of course, has heart-shaped breath strips inside, packaged in a clear tube, so consumers can see the product. It went from an idea to the marketplace in five months. And since then, it has been the top-selling item within the Colgate flagship store on this e-tailer site. And we have seen, since the launch, a significant acceleration in purchasing growth with that approach. So one example, but it shows that we are thinking about e-commerce holistically, not just as another distribution channel. And, in fact, our worldwide e-commerce business third quarter year-to-date is maintaining the same rapid pace of expansion that we saw in the second quarter, so focus and progress there. And finally, productivity, we, as you know, put a lot of focus on funding-the-growth, our productivity program. We've made a lot of very good gains this year. And rather than wait for the question, let me just do the third quarter margin roll-forward right now around that funding-the-growth comment. The prior year gross profit was 60.4%. We got negative 10 basis points from price in this quarter. Our funding-the-growth delivered 220 basis points favorable, maintaining our usual curve across the year, where funding-the-growth builds in the second half, but we saw a headwind of negative material price of 210 basis points, and that was with no impact from transaction. And that traces largely to fats and oils and resins, which have moved differently and negatively to where we were at the end of the second quarter, fats and oils being a volatile marketplace, and the resins affected by the weather event in Texas. And we expect both to continue for the balance of the year. So when you net those off, our gross profit margin was flat year-on-year. And then secondly, we had talked about our extreme focus on structural cost as we came into this last year of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program with two incremental projects included in our second quarter earnings report. And as you've seen from our announcement this morning, building on the successful implementation of our program to-date, we see real opportunity to expand our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, with the same focus on commercial hubs extending Colgate business services and streamlining our global functions, and optimizing our facilities and global supply chain, a way to continue the investment in advertising and support growth for the balance of 2017, and, more importantly, in the pace (13:24) of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program for 2018 and beyond. So we said those were our areas of focus, a quick report back on the fact that they are and will continue to be, and let me hand the call now back to John. John Faucher - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Thanks, Ian. I will start off with some general commentary on the quarter, followed by further detail on divisional performance. I will then finish with some color on our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2017 before opening it up for questions. As a reminder, Ian mentioned at a conference back in September that we will discuss our 2018 outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. This will give us more color on the trajectory of category growth. As Ian said in the press release, the third quarter showed improvement versus the first half of the year. Net sales were up 3% in the quarter versus Q3 2016, with 1.5% volume growth, flat pricing and a 1.5% foreign exchange benefit. Organic sales growth was 1.5% in the third quarter, a sequential improvement versus the first half of the year. Importantly, in the third quarter, we showed sequential improvement in volume versus the second quarter in every one of our divisions. We are also encouraged that on balance, foreign exchange turned favorable in the quarter, as we experienced a top line benefit from foreign exchange for the first time since the third quarter of 2011. Although we do believe that underlying trends are slowly improving and that the consumer outlook is modestly better, the marketplace and our categories remain volatile. In the third quarter, category growth rates improved slightly in several important geographies, including the U.S., Europe, Brazil, and parts of Asia. On a GAAP basis, our gross profit margin was down 10 basis points year-over-year and was flat year-over-year excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. We delivered strong funding-the-growth savings in the quarter, as Ian mentioned, which offset higher raw material costs. There was no benefit from pricing in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, our operating profit margin was down 440 basis points year-over-year in Q3. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, a gain on sale of land in Mexico, and a previously disclosed litigation matter, our operating profit margin was down 160 basis points, driven primarily by a 140 basis point increase in advertising investment. We have discussed all year that we'd be investing in advertising at a more consistent rate throughout the year, and that the year-over-year comparisons would be particularly notable in the second half of the year. Our advertising investment was up approximately 20% year-over-year in the quarter and was up year-over-year in every division. We are expecting an even bigger year-over-year increase in advertising in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share of $0.68 was down 13% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, the previously mentioned one-time items, and benefits from previously disclosed tax matters, diluted earnings per share was flat year-over-year at $0.73. We have returned more than $2.1 billion to shareholders year-to-date through Q3 through share repurchase and dividends. This is an 8% increase versus the first three quarters of 2016. Now moving to the divisions. We'll start off with North America. In Q3, we saw sequential improvement versus the second quarter in volume, net sales and organic sales growth in North America. Net sales were down 0.5% in the quarter, with organic sales minus 1%, driven by volume growth of 3% and slightly favorable foreign exchange. Category growth rates in the U.S. improved sequentially versus the first half when our categories were negative. The slight improvement in category growth was fairly broad based, with a majority of our categories now in positive territory year-to-date. In Oral Care, we maintained our market share leadership in toothpaste and toothbrushes in the U.S. The premium priced whitening segment continues to be an area of strength for us, as we've gained share year-to-date behind the Colgate Optic White and Tom's of Maine Luminous White franchises. Our sales and channels not covered by syndicated data providers improved this quarter, driven by strength in club and e-commerce. We continue to see gains in e-commerce as we look to optimize our digital marketing and promotional strategies to drive market share. In our Home Care business, we saw strong growth in our household cleaning portfolio. While we are still seeing weakness in our hand dish line, category trends improved sequentially in the third quarter versus the second as did our sales trends. As we said on the Q2 call, the business is not yet where it needs to be, but we do believe we are making progress. Now, we'll look at Latin America. Latin America delivered 6.5% net sales growth in the quarter, driven by a combination of solid pricing and volume growth. Foreign exchange was favorable by 1% in the quarter. Our 3% volume growth was the highest for the division since Q2 of 2014. Latin America also delivered strong gross profit growth, which allowed us to significantly increase our advertising investment year-over-year in the division. The volume growth was broad based across the division, with most of our hubs showing growth. Mexico volume was down slightly, but we continued to see strong market share growth in toothpaste, plus 180 basis points year-over-year to more than 82%. Our Colgate Mexico team did an excellent job dealing with the impact of the devastating earthquakes there in Q3. Our Puerto Rico and Caribbean teams right now are focused on helping communities rebuild after Hurricane Maria, and our thoughts are with them as they continue to deal with the aftermath. While the impact of Hurricane Maria on Q3 divisional results was modest, we expect it will have a more notable impact on our Q4 results in Latin America. We are encouraged by the continued improvement in our Brazilian business in the quarter. While the market remains volatile, we grew volume behind new product launches, effective in-store activity and increased advertising. Going forward, our Latin American business will continue to benefit from several recent product launches. In Mexico, we launched Colgate Triple Action Xtra Freshness toothpaste to enhance our base toothpaste business. In Brazil, we saw strong starts from several new products launched in Q3, including Total Mouthwash and Protex Pro Hidrata bar soap and body wash. Moving to Europe, Europe net sales were up 5.5% in the quarter. Organic sales grew 1%, driven by 3% volume growth, with negative pricing in the quarter. Foreign exchange was favorable by 4.5% in the quarter. The volume growth was broad based across the division with growth across all of our hubs. We were particularly pleased by the return to volume and net sales growth in France, and we're still working on rebuilding our toothpaste market shares there. Oral Care was the key driver of volume growth in the European division in the quarter with strength across all three brands \u2013 Colgate, elmex and meridol. We are very pleased with the results of our Colgate Naturals launch in several markets in Europe during the quarter. Naturals is achieving market shares ahead of our initial expectations with high repeat rates and is proving more incremental than initially expected. We plan to continue expanding this line into new geographies going forward. We also expect our Personal Care business to benefit from two new variants of our highly successful Palmolive Gourmet line, and our Sanex Zero% line continues to drive market share gains across multiple Personal Care categories, especially body wash and antiperspirant deodorant. Next, Asia Pacific. Net sales in Asia Pacific were up slightly in the quarter, plus 0.5%, while organic sales were flat. Both volume and pricing were flat in the quarter. Foreign exchange was slightly favorable in Q3. We were very encouraged by a return to volume growth in Greater China after volume declines in the first half of the year. The growth was driven by our e-commerce business, while brick-and-mortar sales trends improved sequentially from the second quarter to the third. The volume growth in Greater China was offset by weakness in Australia and India. Volume in India during Q3 continued to be impacted by the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax at the beginning of the quarter. As our Indian company discussed in their fiscal second quarter press release, they have seen a gradual recovery in the key wholesale channel with trends improving sequentially over the course of the quarter and they expect continued improvement in the coming quarters. India should also benefit from significant increases in advertising investment and the recent launch of Colgate Swarna Vedshakti toothpaste, the high-end entry in the growing Naturals segment that Ian referred to earlier. The Africa/Eurasia division reported net sales growth of 0.5% in Q3 as favorable pricing and foreign exchange offset a decline in volume. The volume weakness continues to be driven primarily by the impact of distributor changes in our sub-Saharan African business. As other companies have highlighted for their businesses, we have also seen a slowdown in our Middle East business due to a difficult economic environment. We posted volume growth in Russia in the quarter, driven by adjustment of promotional price points, in-store activity, and the launch of our Colgate Ancient Secrets toothpaste line in the Naturals segment. As we look at the fourth quarter, while our sub-Saharan African business will benefit from lapping the distributor changes in the year ago period, we do expect continued headwinds from our Middle East business. Africa/Eurasia continues to be a major beneficiary of our increase in advertising investment. Along with a strong support for our new product launches, we have also raised our investment behind initiatives to drive toothpaste per capita consumption. And we'll finish up with Hill's. Hill's delivered 2% net sales growth in the third quarter, with 1% volume growth, flat pricing and a 1% benefit from foreign exchange. The volume growth was driven by the U.S. business including strong growth in e-commerce. Our international business saw net sales and volume growth in every region except for Japan. We've seen sequential improvement in our pet specialty performance in the United States, driven by improved promotional activity. Over the next few quarters, we should see a further benefit from shelf resets in pet superstores. We continue to be enthusiastic about the performance of our Science Diet Youthful Vitality product. This product helps fight the effects of aging in older cats and dogs, 7 years and older. We're supporting the launch with digital advertising and a meaningful campaign to help get older cats and dogs adopted. Specifically, Science Diet Youthful Vitality is working with Animal Planet on the web series, Mission Adoptable, which tells heartwarming stories about older cats and dogs. Now, we'll turn to our outlook for 2017. As stated in our press release, we continue to expect both net sales and organic sales to increase at a low-single-digit rate for the year. Given our gross margin results in the third quarter, we now expect our gross margin expansion will be in the range of 20 to 50 basis points this year versus our previous outlook of the lower end of our 75 to 125 basis points range. This reduction in our outlook is due to a combination of higher raw material costs versus our second quarter expectations and less benefit from pricing. On a GAAP basis, we still expect our earnings per share for the year to be down mid-single digits. On a non-GAAP basis, we are maintaining our guidance for low-single-digit EPS growth. On a GAAP basis, we expect Q4 earnings per share to be down low- to mid-single digits. Excluding charges from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and other one-time items, we would expect Q4 earnings per share to be roughly flat year-over-year. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Good morning, Wendy. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. My question has to do with kind of the longer term philosophical outlook for the business. Great to see a sequential improvement in some of your market shares and in the organic sales growth rate. But despite a significant step-up in your spending, that growth is still coming in well below where you think you can be long term. And I know you don't want to give too much 2018 guidance, but maybe just directionally touch on, hey, as you look into the new year, is the message to your general managers in the markets, hey, spend, spend, spend, because we've got to get market shares up, or hey, we need to have more balanced growth and see more margin expansion than in fact we saw in the third quarter because I can't remember a quarter where we've seen so much operating margin contraction in a favorable foreign exchange environment. Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Okay. That was one very long question, Wendy. So trying to react to it in pieces. The reason I went through the margin roll forward quarter on quarter is to highlight the point that notwithstanding, to exactly the point you made, there was no transaction headwind for the first time in a long time. There was higher than expected underlying commodity pressure, as I mentioned, particularly in fats and oils, and particularly in resins. And as John said, we didn't get benefit from pricing in the third quarter. Now, as you know, many in our space in this particular quarter saw their gross margins contract, perhaps facing a similar composition of business. So as we think about going forward \u2013 and this is not specific to guidance for 2018 \u2013 it's more how we think about running the business. We think about growing our business in excess of the underlying rate of market growth in our categories, which traces back to population and expansion of the middle class, particularly in the emerging markets, which is why we invest the money we do in the per capita consumption building program. So our view, and why we're encouraged by some of the country-specific pickup in category growth, is that we think about growing slightly faster than the rate of growth in our categories, thereby assuming that we make some progress on market share as well. But as you well know, it is not spend at all costs. We are a balanced company, and part of our thinking is to look for expansion in gross margin, as we move forward in order that we can maintain the levels of advertising that we think are appropriate to build our brand equities and announce our innovation. And in these volatile times, that's why we've been so focused in addition to gross margin on structural cost, a journey we began several years back, I think leading many of our peers at the time, because we felt that structurally with the hubs, with the Colgate Service Centers, and the technology that binds all of that together for us, the SAP that we have across our enterprise, we could secure a more efficient structure, which would give us speed and saving. And as you see in our announcement, we now see continued expansion that we can take charge of over the next couple of years, which gives us a little bit of extra savings in a volatile environment. But the focus is very much a balance between growth, gross margin, and cost structure to grow the top line in a reasonable fashion in terms of the environment we're in, and deliver a return. Operator : Next, we will go to Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for allowing me to ask a question. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Good morning. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I wanted to pull out a couple of threads that Mr. Faucher talked about and see if we can go a little bit deeper. First, lots of conversation on innovation, natural \u2013 predominantly premium it sounded like, a lot of premium mix innovation that you're pushing out, but at the same time he talked about a bit of a reset in terms of margins in part attributable to less pricing expectation despite higher costs. And obviously, we saw this quarter some pricing pressure emerge in a couple of markets. Can you expound on that, first, the dichotomy of premiumization driving growth, yet pricing under pressure? And then also maybe give us a little more meat on the bone of what do you think is driving some of the underlying pricing pressure, some of the factors that are contributing to it, and how many of those may be enduring as we think about the future. And I'm not trying to tease out guidance for 2018. I'm just trying to think about the underlying health of the business. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah, yeah, well, good questions. I'll have to dig into the Mr. Faucher remark. Look, from an innovation point of view, as we have said before and it ties to the Naturals comment, in a way, as we move with these Naturals innovations, we are pleased to compete in that space, because as you say, the innovation is premium. And we have a bias whenever we innovate to see if we can't make that innovation premium, in other words, deliver a value to the consumer that they're happy to pay for and, at the same time, be accretive from a gross margin point of view. But we always make the point \u2013 and I would make it now \u2013 that when we think of innovation, we think of innovation across our entire portfolio, and in all of the markets in which we do business, we operate across a full bandwidth of price points, and even packaging forms on occasion, sachets instead of tubes, to make sure that we can capture in the emerging markets, the emerging consumer and the rural consumer. So, yes, a bias to premium where the consumer sees value, but we never forget the fact that we have a full portfolio and we're always innovating across that full portfolio even if we talk more to the premium end innovation. Now, when you turn to pricing, and you look at the third quarter, I guess you see a couple of factors. One is Europe, and European pricing has been pressured for many, many years, given the market conditions in Europe. And it is unlikely that that is going to change any time soon, which is why you may remember, when we did the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, we started with structure in Europe first because we had concluded as a matter of strategy that underlying category growth would be under the kind of pressure that we have seen and we expect we'll continue to see. North America, which saw pricing decline this quarter, is a little bit of a different story. You have a couple of factors going on, I think. Number one is heightened competitive promotional activity, I would say, particularly in the Home Care businesses, which, in our case, would be softeners and hand dish, and also to a certain extent in the liquid soap businesses. And we said on the last call that we were going to make some pricing adjustments in order to continue to make progress on our dish business, which had been impacted by that heightened promotional activity in the second quarter. And so we have done that and we have put focus behind getting those price points right in the retail channels where that is important. And, obviously, as the promotional pressure eases, we will clearly ease back on the pricing because we would much rather put the investment, as we continue to do, in the brand building areas of advertising and consumption building promotion. I'm pleased to say that specific to the U.S., as we track this trend data on a weekly and monthly basis, we're beginning to see an easing of that promotional intensity on Home Care, which I think augurs well for the future. And I would finally say that you have seen in the past in the emerging markets, our ability to take pricing in relation to transaction cost impact. I think you can be assured that we would seriously consider doing the same for a direct commodity cost increase as well, so that type of pricing in those kind of markets, I think, you can expect in our future plans. Operator : And we'll move to our next question from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Thank you. My question is regarding in the cadence for the North American sales within the third quarter. And if you got more traction with advertisement spending and promotional spending as you progressed in the quarter. So in other words, I was trying to find out if the organic sales lift that you're planning for was across the board or if there was any areas where you can see potentially some buildup, I mean, positive buildup, into the fourth quarter and in particularly with the \u2013 also with the destocking that you had in the last quarter of last year. Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah, I think we obviously track trade inventory levels well. We did have some destocking as we came into this year. We did not see any destocking in the third quarter. I think, as John mentioned in his prepared remarks, we were actually quite pleased by the broad based, if modest but nonetheless increase in category growth rates in the United States. As I said a little bit earlier in response to the pricing question, we have made our Home Care businesses necessarily more competitive in the appropriate retail channels, but if the category growth rates continue the pickup we have seen, that would clearly be favorable for the quarter, and of course, as you have seen, we have now seen sequential progress in North America from the first quarter this year. So I would say nothing exceptional to call out in that regard. The inventory destocking would seem to be behind us, and we're building against the underlying growth in the categories going forward. Operator : And next we'll go to Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right, thank you. Good morning. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Good morning, Bonnie. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. I have a question on your Global Growth and Efficiency Program. While I think it's encouraging that you guys extended it, I guess I'm wondering if this decision implies in any way that you're expecting more fundamental pressures on your business in the future that might need to be offset by more aggressive cost cutting. And then are there any projects that you've started already that might begin to benefit margins in Q4, especially since you're up against another tough gross margin compare? Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah. I guess the answer on the Global Growth and Efficiency Program is more the fact that we have, since we began the program, been intently focused on efficiency and speed that we can generate through these commercial hubs through the Colgate Business Service Centers and further rationalizing our manufacturing and other facilities. And the thread that ties all those together has been the SAP technology that we have had across our company for a long time. And the expansion you're seeing is more based on the further opportunity we see building on the success of what we have done thus far. So rather it's not in reaction to anything. It's more building on the learning that we have developed over the last several years. Now, to turn that around from a pure business point of view, yes, we're looking for the savings. More importantly, we're looking for the speed and efficiency. And in a volatile world, it does give you some downside protection, but we didn't go into this with that as the thought in our minds, it was more truly building on what we had learned as we have been deploying all of these initiatives over the last several years. Every time you get into one of these things, you get more learning and it spawns more ideas and more things that you can go after. So I would say it was more proactive. It wasn't reactive to a gloomy future. Operator : Next we'll go to Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, thanks. Good morning. I guess I wanted to talk about the portfolio a little bit. In a softer environment, we're seeing a lot of companies trying to fix the mix here either exiting businesses in different geographies that maybe don't strategically make sense or doing tuck-in acquisitions. So with the changing environment, we hear you guys talk about the locals and just about some of the disruptors that are out there, and your prestigious balance sheet that's out there. Can you talk maybe about the portfolio? Are there areas that maybe you can prune a little bit more and then maybe actually add some new categories to the mix here to kind of leverage what seems to be a leaner cost structure over the next few years? Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah, good question, Jason. Very strategic. If I take a step back on the portfolio, the full portfolio categories that we have today, as you well know, I think, we have a very sharp priority focus in terms of Oral Care, Pet, Personal, and Home Care in that order, because the underlying growth dynamics in the categories are favorable in that order, consumer loyalty and emotional engagement, therefore pricing, are favorable in that order, and therefore gross margin potential is favorable in that order. And I bring you all the way back to the per capita consumption building programs and education programs we have on toothpaste. So within the portfolio we have today, we have a very clear focus, and obviously even within segments, we're looking to accentuate the premium end of those segments. Disposals, we have done them from time to time, despite the fact that we prioritize our categories the way we do. It's like having four kids. You don't love the fourth any less than the first three, and that's the case with Home Care from our point of view. We have tactically over the years \u2013 I think Latin America was the last example where we divested of our bleach business and put it with Clorox as the acquirer, probably a better home for a bleach business than Colgate. So are there small things like that that one might see? Maybe. Your idea of buying on the outside, again, is a good one. It's one we always have in view. We think about it quite broadly, whether it be companies, whether it be brands, or even technology as we have demonstrated in the past. And we put quite a lot of study attention against that. We put our customary financial discipline against that. You're right, we do have the balance sheet flexibility. And if in these volatile times, an external candidate that was attractive, was feeling perhaps a little bit of pressure and looking for a different home, on the assumption the financials would work out, we would be a willing buyer, as we have been with Sanex and Tom's and GABA, all of which have done very well for us. So the answer is, the right brand business saw technology, absolutely, at the right price. Operator : And next we'll go to Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, good morning. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Good morning, Kevin. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : I wanted to come back to the topic of advertising spending and what the appropriate level is longer term. And my questions in the context, there's been a number of discussions on these calls in the past on striking the right balance between trade spending and advertising spending, and now it seems like you're leaning in a bit more again on ad spending following a couple of years where ad spending for the company in total as a percent of sales was sub-10%. And John mentioned it'll be up again in the fourth quarter, but I guess that's not surprising given you're cycling at historically low ad spend as a percent of sales. So the question is as we look at it within the next several years, not just 2018 because I know that you're not prepared to give guidance today, but are you still comfortable with ad spending a little north of 10% of sales or do you think that needs to move higher in the current environment? Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah, I think one has to come back to the beginning premise, and that is the reason we made the statement we made coming into this year is that with the savage and indeed sometimes over the last couple of years foreign exchange moves were extremely savage, we had as a court of last resort reduced advertising to offset the sharp move in foreign exchange. And we made the statement this year that that's not what we wanted to do. That doesn't change as a matter of commercial strategy at all, the fact that we work to have a balance between what we do at retail and what we do in the traditional advertising and promotion spending. So as we go forward, when we build our advertising, we build it against a business plan. We build it by country. We build it by brand in country. And it rolls off at the corporate level. I would say the level of advertising that we have this year is a healthy level of advertising. If you talk to a marketer, there is always the potential to spend more advertising. And I think we would be driven more by the good ROIs we're getting, the particular activity we have in any year, the adequacy of the advertising to be on air for a long period of time to make sure we're building awareness, and what the competitive context would be. And of course, as we are moving forward in this world, you're seeing that continued shift from the traditional advertising into digital, which brings some of its own economies. So the shorthand answer would be, the level of spending this year is, we think, appropriate but good for our business, and we'd be guided going forward by the things I mentioned a little bit earlier, but that does not in any way undervalue the power of what we do at retail, and we'll always be working to balance those two investments. Operator : Next we'll go to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Sorry if I missed... Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hey Ali. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, sorry if I missed the Q4 organic sales guidance if you gave any, but if you could, could you just talk about that? And then from a margin perspective, I guess I have two questions. And perhaps if it's appropriate, Dennis Hickey or John Faucher can jump in here, but for the productivity program extension, clearly it's good. We like to see more cost savings. But at what point do kind of more or less regular one-time charges turn into recurring as opposed to one time? And I don't mean that as purely an accounting question, but a little bit more of a business question, as well, from that perspective. And then we also noticed that the return on your charges, so in other words if I just divide the savings number you're contemplating by the charges, the extension is much higher than what you've been doing so far, so it's like 46% versus 30s-percent, i.e. much greater return on what you're extending here. So it does actually feel like the nature \u2013 to one of the earlier questions, does it actually feel like the nature of the extension of the Global Growth and Efficiency is different than what has happened so far, so it feels much more aggressive, indeed perhaps reactionary. I don't know. You said it wasn't but it feels that way. And certainly it would feel more head count focused given that type of return profile. But would love obviously your interpretation of that as well. Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Thanks, Ali. Well, let me start there, given where you left it. It was not reactionary at all, period. Everyone can have their view. I think the important thing to say, as I tried to say earlier, it has been in part the learning process we have gone through in the areas we have been focusing on, and the opportunity one has with technology to simplify what you do and then simplify the organization needed to do it. So the reason for the higher rate of return, as we have been building the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, we have built a lot of capability. This in a way is more of an SG&A focus against a built infrastructure, allowing us in many areas to delayer the management structure required to operate without any impact to quality. So entirely planned for and planned for based on the learning we had had. On the technical aspect of the productivity program, we have obviously been through this in some detail as a company from a financial point of view, from a legal point of view, and with our auditors from an external point of view, as we always do with these kinds of programs. And we are comforted and assured and believe that these are indeed one-time discrete activities in the same themes that we have been focused on before. And no, Ali, you didn't miss the fourth quarter top line guidance. We didn't give it. Operator : Okay. And next we'll go to Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hey, Dara. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So I was hoping to get more of a review of category growth around the world besides some of the commentary that John made. First, in the U.S., you did mention a slight pickup sequentially in category growth, but we're still seeing pretty weak year-over-year trends in terms of category growth. And that doesn't seem to fit with macro indicators that theoretically should be favorable for the consumer. So I'd love to get your view on what's driving the U.S. category weakness, and if you think it's more temporary or longer term and if this slight pickup you've seen continues going forward. And then second, a similar question in emerging markets. There we're hearing about some initial signs of a pickup from a number of CPG companies and the macro indicators generally seem favorable, so are you seeing category growth recover in emerging markets in general and are you comfortable that that builds as we look out to Q4 and 2018? Thanks. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah, yeah, obviously good questions, and one we're extremely focused on. So, yes, we were pleased, as John said, with the market-by-market upticks that we saw this quarter. And as we said earlier, this is one of the things we want to track very, very carefully over the next couple of months in order that when we talk in January with you all, we talk in as informed way as we can about what we see in terms of our categories. If you take a macro step back and look at our category growth rates around the world, what you still see is the emerging markets growing mid-single digits, between 4% and 6%, depending on the geography. And in the developed world, you basically are still seeing flat to modestly up in Europe and North America. Again, those little green shoots we have seen, clearly we are looking to see them continue to build and strengthen. As I said before, we think this will adjust because we don't see in any of our data and some of the bespoke research we've done, we don't see any indication that consumer behavior in terms of brushing their teeth is changing in any way. So a little bit of an improvement. The macros are still, from a category point of view, where we have been saying they were before. We'll be watching this very, very closely and be as informed as we can in January. Operator : And next we'll go to Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Thanks, good morning everyone. Ian, I think \u2013 there are a lot of debates going on in the market, but I think most of us can agree that Colgate is one of the best-in-class companies across any market, across any category, but obviously it's been a challenge the last year or two. And I guess I ask that question in the vein of it looks like we could be in this period of time where just the cost of doing business is going up structurally. And I wanted to get your comments on that and your thoughts because it seems like more local innovation to keep pace with the local consumer and local competition, changes in channel mix, which could be putting more pressure on the supply chain, technology, et cetera, et cetera. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on that broadly, as you look at your business and the industry as a whole. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah. Well, thanks, Nik. It's a time of great change. I guess that's the best way to say it. At the ground level, you have all of this country-by-country volatility, never mind weather patterns which seem to strike, with gay abandon and complete shock and surprise. So on the one hand, you're dealing with a lot of pushes on the business that seem to come from nowhere and a general slowdown in categories, which we think is transitory and will change over time. And then from the big picture point of view, you've got an enormous structural change in the way the consumer is engaging with brands and companies, and choosing to buy the products that those companies provide to those consumers, and I think that comes down to mastery of digital in its broadest sense, which is how you run the company with it, how you engage consumers with it, and indeed how you ultimately sell to consumers. In and of themselves, if you organize yourselves right and you take full advantage of technology, it doesn't fundamentally change the cost of doing business. Indeed, in some areas, it can make you more agile and more efficient doing business. But as you move along, you're going to get resistance for the change to e-commerce from other quarters and there's going to be that constant buffeting on cost, price, and/or otherwise. And I think the role of CPG companies is to stay true to the consumers they serve, make sure their brands remain relevant and navigate how you engage with and sell to those consumers over time. So I see it as a challenge, but I don't see it as a God-given conclusion that costs of necessity must become a forever headwind. How you do business will have to change over time, but that's a different thing. Operator : Okay. Next we'll go to Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks so much for the question. I'm just looking at market shares, and by their absence, it seems like you lost market share in the U.S., a lot of the Asia markets including China and India, Brazil, France, UK, and I'm just trying to, number one, am I right on that just because you didn't comment on them being up? And are you losing to local players? And is this something at some point you're willing to take a price rollback so that you can sort of stem that or are you only going to try the innovation and media route? Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: You're right. In some markets, we have seen some share pressure. I'll kind of go through by market. The reasons are usually different, and the response is therefore different. Brazil, frankly, we've been very focused on growing that business from a pricing point of view to protect the margin and a volume point of view. Our market share is still north of 72%. It is year-to-date a little bit weaker than the prior year, but frankly, we're damn pleased with the choices we have made and expect to build that market share going forward. Mexico, we're still north of 82% and it's going up, so there is a marketplace where we're making progress. You come to France, France was a customer reason. We are now back in distribution with that customer and building both sales and share, and that of course affects the national share in the country, and, more importantly, given the size of France, it affects the European share. So, that is in the process of rebuilding. In China, our year-to-date volume share is actually flat. Our year-to-date value share is down. The reason it's down is because we are not yet taking full advantage of the high growth in the category, which is at the premium end of the category, including one of the local brands. And that is what the Naturals offering that I mentioned earlier is on plan and just building distribution, is seeking to offset. And it's a similar story in India, and again we now have building in distribution this Colgate Vedshakti, as John mentioned, which is our Naturals counter to two local brands. So I've tried to answer by each of the geographies, but those would be the answers. The U.S. share is actually essentially flat, and we still lead in the United States. So there's no share issue there. Operator : Okay. Next we'll go to Bill Chappell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hey, Bill. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Just a question on kind of the commodities buzz in the quarter and looking forward. I think you said it was in total a 200 basis point kind of headwind. Any way to kind of quantify how much of that was a surprise or extraordinary. You talked about it lasting into fourth quarter, just in kind of how these things play back in terms of resin costs, do you expect that to drag far into 2018 or is fourth quarter kind of the end? Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Candidly, Bill, coming out of the second quarter, we thought fats and oils were on the way down for the balance of the year, and I think we guided for that at the time. And they have since reversed. The resins, perhaps not totally surprising, but seems to be lingering longer than we would have expected. So certainly from a planning point of view, we're assuming a no change for the fourth quarter. And whilst we haven't got eyesight on data yet, I think a fair assumption would be that they may drift into 2018 a little bit. Operator : Okay. And next we'll go to Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about... Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hey, Mark. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, Ian. I wanted to ask about how you think about what's the biggest contributing factor to sales growth and sort of relative share performance when you talk about local competition or Naturals, I know there can be a bit of overlapping there, or contrasting that with multinationals like GSK, who have been putting up high-single-digit-type growth on what is a very big brand. So I guess how do you think about it in terms of what is contributing vis-\u00e0-vis what I just mentioned? And on the Naturals piece, how do you think about the Colgate brand and consumer acceptance of it with a natural positioning relative to what it's historically stood for? Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah. Well, again, a lot of questions in there, Mark. But the GSK is clearly a competitor in the space, has been for a long time. Obviously a sensitivity-based brand. It's the one segment we don't lead in in the world, and although we have terrific technology, and that's a segment we are looking to build dentist-by-dentist, market-by-market. But the trouble with Naturals is when you say Naturals, everybody thinks of something, but it may not be the same thing. So in the United States, you say Naturals, we might say Tom's. You translate Naturals in India, it's got more of an Ayurveda twist to it. You transfer it in China, it's got different ingredients, and you take it to Russia and it's something different again. So, that's why we made the point, yes, this is general trend of Naturals which includes the local brands, but hasn't been created by some of these local brands. But it's different market-by-market. So having innovation groups on the ground helping you build that offering to tailor it to those local tastes whether be they conceptual, be they flavor, be they color \u2013 some of the color of natural products is, shall we say, interesting \u2013 is a tricky thing and a complex thing, and a very specific thing. As to Colgate, Colgate in its broadest definition is a worldwide family brand, and Colgate, take India, we have been there for 80 years, and Colgate is one of the most trusted brand names, indeed brands, in the country. So Colgate's early entry into many of these emerging markets long before our American companion competitors means that the Colgate brand has been established in the culture. So you start talking about combining a Naturals offering interpreted for people in the country, the Colgate brand is very familiar and trusted by people in the country, so there's no clash between concept and brand. Operator : Next we'll go to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hey, Lauren. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Two things. One was just on Hill's, so it's pretty rare to see no pricing in Hill's. And I had to go back to the price cuts in 2010, and then before that, I think it was 2004. So just talk a little bit about what's gone on there? Is it anything in terms of promotional strategy or kind of gross (01:06:56) to net funding with your sort of more diversified distribution footprint for Hill's. That was one. And then second was also on pricing. In North America, I was just curious, I know you mentioned some of the competitive promotional activity more in the Home Care and Personal Care with soaps. But I was wondering if kind of the outsized growth you've had it looked like in e-commerce and in club, if that's also contributing to some of the pricing pressure that you saw this quarter and how we should think about that going forward. Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah. The mix of the non-Nielsen channels in the United States tends to have slightly lower pricing than the other channels, so that is a contributory factor, Lauren. But the rest is predominant and true, and that is the Home Care and the liquid soap promotional activity, which we have met. And as I mentioned, the latest information we're seeing shows it ebbing slightly. So, that's the answer on North America. E-commerce, no, that's not a factor. For Hill's, Hill's had strong pricing last year, and as part of re-engaging with the specialty retailers, most one of the two, we have a lot of introductory activity going on in the quarter to reestablish the brand, be it couponing \u2013 targeted couponing and/or otherwise, and that as you know gets translated into price, so that was largely reestablishment in the U.S. with the specialty retailers. Operator : And next we'll go to Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Armani Khoddami - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Hi, thank you very much. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hey, Jonathan. Armani Khoddami - Consumer Edge Research LLC : This is Armani Khoddami in for Jon. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Hi. Armani Khoddami - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Just one quick question \u2013 yeah, how are you doing? So a quick question for you. Does the success of the Naturals line give you maybe some \u2013 or the ahead of planned performance there, does that give you some confidence around the ability to take price? I know we've talked a lot about price investments over this call. But it seems like that product specifically has performed ahead of expectations. And then also whether it be the ability to price in emerging markets with Naturals, but also as we looked in the U.S., a key competitor of yours seems to have been taking prices up over the past 6 to 12 months. And any comment around a thought about taking \u2013 the ability to take price even here in the U.S. as well. Thank you. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Yeah, well, Naturals, the Naturals offerings we have in the emerging markets are at meaningful price premiums. Indeed we had a learning in China where we had done an in-store test of the offering at, shall we say, a more market-level pricing. And we found that we had underpriced, so as we have begun to take it nationally, we have significantly increased the pricing. So a general learning with Naturals is that part of the concept that generates the value that the consumer believes is real value to them is that they be at a higher price. No brand espouses that strategy better than Tom's of Maine here in the United States, which has grown nicely every year basically since we acquired it and carries a meaningful price premium to the marketplace. And in terms of pricing in general in toothpaste here in the United States, we have seen some progress on our pricing just over the last month or so, so we have been working to keep pace with pricing trends here in the United States. But your most important question, I think, was around the Naturals idea. I think all of the learning we have to-date demonstrates that that offering justifies a premium price, and indeed the consumer seeks it. So, thanks for the question. Operator : And those are all the questions we have today. I'll turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional comments or closing remarks. Ian M. Cook - Colgate-Palmolive Co.: Thanks, Dave. Well, thank you, everybody for being on the call and listening to what we have to say. Thanks to the Colgate folk for making it happen, and Happy Thanksgiving to everybody, and we look forward to talking again in the new year. Bye. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Joining me this morning are, Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Henning Jakobsen, Vice President and Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Vice President and Treasurer. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our more recent filings with the SEC, including our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Ian Cook : Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. Belated Happy New Year. As has been our custom for a little while now, I'd like to provide some introductory thoughts, and I intend them to be framed on the fourth quarter results and our thinking for 2018. You will recall on the last call and, indeed, the one before that, we talked about 4 areas of business focus for the company, increased advertising spending behind more impactful creative innovation across the business but especially naturals in toothpaste, which I will come back to; working with all retail partners, especially e-commerce; and then, finally, aggressively maximizing productivity up and down the income statement. And those remain our 4 areas of our business focus. But to talk more specifically about the fourth quarter and 2018, let me start by saying that while our organic sales performance in the quarter improved sequentially versus the third, the rate of improvement was modestly less than we expected and comes despite what we see as sequential improvement in growth rates for our categories and importantly, improved market share performance as we work our way through the quarter. That's, of course, particularly true for our Oral Care business where we made significant incremental advertising investments across the second half of last year. So let me focus specifically on 4 things, which, hopefully, will give you some clarity on the progress we believe we're making. First, category growth. As we discussed on the third quarter call, we continue to see improvement in category growth across many parts of the year -- the world. If we look at the U.S., growth in the categories in which we compete improved from being down slightly in the first half to 1% in the third quarter and 1.6% in the fourth quarter. In Asia Pacific, we saw a second half acceleration in toothpaste category growth in key markets like China, the Philippines, Southeast Asia and Australasia. And in Europe, we are seeing initial signs that our categories are strengthening with the improvement in growth driven by Oral Care. And very interestingly, this morning, the scanner data for the last 4 weeks in Europe just issued, which show our sales, on a consumption basis, up around 7.5% and our toothpaste market share, up a full point. So all signs we see of an improvement in category growth. Secondly, on top of that category growth, we continue to focus on growing our market share. This is one of the key reasons for our increased advertising over 2017 and, as we said in the release, continuing into 2018. And we do believe we are seeing initial signs of this paying off as our market share performance is improving in many of the key markets where we have ramped up the advertising. We're seeing it in Europe. And during the fourth quarter, we gained market share year-over-year in 6 categories. Through the third quarter, we were not gaining share in any categories. And it is broad-based. It is beyond simply a reinstatement in one retailer in the western parts of Europe. In Brazil, we posted a 73% market share in the fourth quarter. In fact, in December, our market share was 73.7%, which is basically tied for the highest share we've -- we ever had in that country. And we gained market share year-over-year. I would also say that our market share in Mexico is back up to 83%. And we continue to spend behind new launches as well, including the Colgate Naturals offerings. In Russia, which, under the name Ancient Secrets, has a very unique and differentiated advertising campaign. We're seeing very strong performance. We have seen nationally the market share build to over 2 percentage points with distribution building. It is adding to the overall share in Russia, which we have seen grow for the last 3 periods. And indeed, in some of the retail outlets, where you build faster distribution, we have seen market shares north of 3% and approaching 4% with penetration, thereby, trial building very, very nicely. We've seen our Naturals offerings in China just under 1 share point. We've seen them in India approaching 1 share point; and in the Morgan trade, approaching 2 share points. So we believe these businesses are off to a good start from a concept point of view, supported the point I was starting with, with compelling advertising and seeing that in our market shares. So we're seeing improvements in the category growth rates and market shares, which, of course, is leading to increase consumption, which you see in the scanner data, particularly here in North America. And we think that increase in consumption is going to support, and I'll come back to organic sales for 2018, but is going to support our ambitions for organic growth in 2018. And suffice it to say, that is, of course, our #1 priority. Another area for us in 2018 is acting with greater speed and agility. You may recall, when we began our journey on the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, we said that one of the underlying objectives was speed and agility. And we have made quite a few changes over the last several years, which is opening up opportunity in that area. And clearly, the way the world is moving, whether it's e-commerce, digital in general or the local brands, we are committed to moving more rapidly. And this is not just true around innovation; it's about how we go about doing everything in the company. I mentioned briefly on the third quarter call this Colgate Dare to Love toothpaste cocreated with one of our e-commerce partners in China. And I just came back from China, actually, and we created the product in a very short period of time, around 5 months. It was our largest and fastest-selling multipack on the 11/11 Singles' Day in China and the single biggest growth driver in our portfolio for this online retailer. Now interestingly, it has additional benefits. It brings us to a younger female millennial user with a higher wealth program. So the combination of our advertising and the offering itself sees us broaden our reach in terms of consumers. We've also brought greater speed and agility to how we go about our digital marketing efforts. I've mentioned before our consumer engagement centers, which are truly always on as we listen to what's happening in real time online, quickly engaging with consumers. And our increased digital media investment and focus on faster, easier ways to test and improve the creative has led to significant improvements in return on investments over the year. And this has helped us increase our e-commerce market share leadership in toothpaste in the U.S. for both the fourth quarter and the full year. I would say, editorially, is that our e-commerce business, in general, was up just under 60% for the full year. And finally, although it may seem a minor area to you, packaging development for us is an enormous part of what goes behind bringing our products to the marketplace. And we have completely reengineered our packaging process to get our products from design brief to the shelf in about 1/2 of the time and about 1/3 lower cost across our packaging systems all around the world. So the third area of operating focus is speed and agility. And obviously, the last area I'd like to come back to is productivity. We have a strong history of margin expansion, and we expect that to continue going forward. Our margins have been under pressure across our industry over the past year or so, and we know we need to push productivity aggressively. Now our productivity efforts start with funding-the-growth, and we have seen and did see in the fourth quarter increased logistics costs given fuel and availability, and indeed, raw material costs stayed at about the third quarter level but due to hurricanes and the price of oil resins and given pulp packaging going up beyond our initial estimations for the fourth quarter. So through our funding-the-growth program, we are working to reduce these costs through many digital platforms interestingly to see us real time looking at what our logistics providers are paying for fuel, allowing us to economize, and at the same time, using new technologies, like Uber Freight, where we are a founding participant, to improve service and manage volatility. And I'll come back to funding-the-growth when we go through the margin roll forward. And as we talked about on our last call, we remain resolutely focused on maximizing our Global Growth and Efficiency Program to streamline our cost structure. The key, of course, is to focus on where we think we're going to be in the future and organize for that, so that we can meet those changes head on. For example, we, in the last 4 months, have just redesigned our supply chain organization to become organized by region while keeping the central capability, which allows us, again, to respond more speedily to local market needs while still leveraging at global scale and capability. The productivity is not just about cutting costs. We also think it's about simplification, which is a very big area of focus for the company. And for example, while we are launching new products like the Naturals I just mentioned, we're also focused on reducing the complexity of our business by eliminating less productive SKUs. This allows us to be more efficient and effective in bringing these products to the marketplace. Now if we look at our SKUs on a global basis, we see them down about 7% on a global basis and our range of reduction is from 12% at the high end and, in case of one division, a modest increase. But overall, a 7% reduction in SKUs globally at the time we're bringing innovation to the marketplace, which allows you to put the more productive SKUs on the shelf and, therefore, get more productive consumption and sales velocity from them. And as we go through that, we see an average improvement in offtake productivity approaching 7%. So those are the key takeaways I'd like to leave you with as we reflect on 2017 and more importantly, look at what we need to do to further accelerate profitable growth in 2018. Now before I turn it back to John who has stayed for all of this, I wanted to discuss our longer-term outlook for top line growth, which many of you have asked me about at conferences and on past conference calls. Now before this year, we have consistently delivered against our 4% to 7% long-term organic revenue growth target, although as we have seen more towards the lower end since the financial crisis. You may recall that, that range was determined when global growth for our categories was around 4% to 5% per year on a fairly consistent basis. Of course, if you look at our categories over the last 12 to 18 months, they've been growing at roughly a 2% rate, slightly up, as I commented earlier, in the fourth quarter. But the 2% we've been operating in was developed markets moving closer to 0 with developing markets coming down from a high single digits to the mid-single digits. Now while we believe these growth rates are beginning to improve, we think it's appropriate to plan with an assumption that category growth rate will be below those heavy historical levels even if it's greater than what we've seen in the most recent past. So as we look forward, starting with 2018, we think it more probable that our categories will grow in a 2% to 4% range. And on top of this growth, we believe that we will return to consistent market share growth behind the strength of our brands, our increased investment, our ability to innovate and in our market execution. And we believe, from a consumption point of view, we're already seeing signs of that. So this combination of category growth and market share growth should put us in the range of 3% to 5% top line organic growth rate, and that's the stance we are taking for 2018 and beyond. Now obviously, we will be doing our level-best to help bring our categories back to the higher growth rates. But for now, we think that prudence is warranted. And clearly, if the growth rates accelerate, that's a good problem to have. Mr. Faucher? John Faucher : Thanks, Ian. After providing some general commentary on the quarter, I will briefly go into some detail on divisional performance. I will then provide some further detail on our outlook for 2018 before opening up for your questions. As Ian said, we showed progress in the fourth quarter on our efforts to reaccelerate top line growth. We showed sequential improvement in net sales growth in key markets, like the U.S., Western Europe and India. Furthermore, our takeaway trends, as shown in syndicated data, improved at a greater rate with sequential improvement in market share in key markets. We exit 2017 with Q4 representing our highest growth quarter of the year in net sales, organic sales and volume. Net sales are up 4.5% in the quarter versus Q4 2016 with 3% volume growth, minus 1% pricing and a 2.5% foreign exchange benefit. Organic sales growth was 2% in the fourth quarter, continuing the sequential improvement we saw on the third quarter. On a GAAP basis, our gross profit margin was down 60 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, it was down 40 basis points year-over-year. We delivered strong funding-the-growth savings in the quarter, which mostly offset higher raw material costs, while pricing was a negative impact to gross margin. On a GAAP basis, our operating profit margin was down 200 basis points year-over-year in Q4. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program in both periods and the 2016 litigation matter, our operating profit margin was down 190 basis points driven primarily by an increase in advertising investment. On a dollar basis, advertising investment was up 24% year-over-year in Q4. As Ian mentioned in the press release, we intend to continue to spend behind our brands in 2018 with a focus on our base business, new products and consumption building activities. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share of $0.37 was down 46% year-over-year in Q4. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program in both periods, U.S. tax reform and the 2016 litigation matter, diluted earnings per share was flat year-over-year at $0.75. For 2017, we returned more than $2.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now moving to the divisions. We'll start off with North America. In Q4, we saw a sequential improvement versus the third quarter in volume, net sales and organic sales growth in North America. Net sales were up 1% in the quarter with organic sales up 1% driven volume growth of 4.5% and pricing of minus 3.5%, while foreign exchange was even with the year ago period. We continue to see significant pricing pressure in the liquid hand soap and hand dish categories. Category growth rates in the U.S. continue to improve sequentially with every category, except power toothbrush, posting faster growth in the second half of '17 versus the first half of '17. In Oral Care, we widened our market share leadership in toothpaste and toothbrushes in the U.S. In toothpaste, after seeing declines year-over-year in the first half of the year, our market share increased year-over-year in the fourth quarter driven by our premium brands, including Colgate Optic White and Tom's of Maine. Now we'll look at Latin America. Latin America delivered 4% net sales growth in the quarter driven by a combination of 4% volume growth and 1.5% foreign exchange, while pricing was minus 1.5%. Organic sales for the division grew 2.5%. Net sales growth in Latin America was driven by Mexico and Brazil. In Mexico, our volume declines were more than offset by positive pricing. We gained toothpaste market share versus Q4 2016 behind our Kids line and Triple Action Xtra Freshness. Our double-digit net sales growth in Brazil was driven by strong volume performance. And as Ian mentioned, our toothpaste shares in Brazil are improving behind increased advertising support, effective merchandising and new products. Brazil also benefited from the launch of Colgate Total mouth rinse, which has added two points to our mouth rinse market share since its Q3 launch. In 2018, Brazil should benefit from several new Oral Care product launches in the high-growth pharmacy channel, along with a robust Personal Care pipeline. Moving to Europe, Europe continues to show strong sequential improvement in Q4 with net sales growth of 13%. Organic sales grew 4%, our best organic sales performance in Europe since first quarter 2010, driven by 6% volume growth with negative 2% pricing. Foreign exchange is favorable by 9% in the quarter. While our price business benefited from lapping against easy comparisons, the volume growth in Europe continued to be broad-based. We saw particular strength in Southern and Western Europe, Poland and the Nordic countries. Europe saw a significant step-up in advertising spending in the quarter versus the prior year, and we believe this is paying off in sequential improvement in market shares as well as in organic sales growth. In Germany, our largest market in Europe, we have gained a full point of market share year-to-date in toothpaste with our year-over-year share gains accelerating in the fourth quarter driven by strength in the elmex and meridol brands. Last quarter, we mentioned the success of our launch of Colgate Natural Extracts line in Europe, and sales for Colgate Natural Extracts continued to come in ahead of our expectations. The Naturals category is relatively underdeveloped in toothpaste in Europe, and we are looking to launch Colgate Naturals in more markets in 2018 to drive incremental growth. Sanex continued to deliver solid growth behind the 0% line, while our French fabric softener business, Soupline, which is the market leader in that country, continued its strong growth through premium innovation. Next is Asia Pacific. Net sales in Asia Pacific were up 6% in the quarter with organic sales up 2.5%. Net sales growth was driven by a combination of pricing and volume growth, while foreign exchange added 3.5%. Our net sales growth was driven primarily by India and Greater China. Our volume in India was up double digits as we lap demonetization in the year ago period. India also benefited from positive pricing, and we continue to see benefits from our launches in the Naturals space with Colgate Cibaca Vedshakti and Colgate Swarna Vedshakti driving incremental sales. In Greater China, negative volume was offset by positive pricing, and we continue to benefit from growth in e-commerce where we have market share leadership. The Africa/Eurasia division reported net sales growth of 2% in Q4 as positive foreign exchange offset a slight decline in volume, while pricing was even with the year ago period. We saw volume growth in our Sub-Saharan Africa business as we lap last year's distributor changes. We also delivered solid volume growth in Russia driven by the continued benefit from our Q3 launch of Colgate Ancient Secrets toothpaste, as Ian mentioned. As we called out on our Q3 conference call, the volume weakness this quarter was primarily driven by economic softness in the Middle East. And we'll finish up with Hill's. Hill's delivered 2.5% net sales growth in the fourth quarter driven by a combination of positive pricing and foreign exchange, while volume was even with the year ago period. Organic sales grew 0.5%. We continue to see strong growth in e-commerce in developed markets. In particular, we are seeing strong share gains on e-commerce in the United States with Prescription Diet. We are also seeing rapid growth in several of our emerging markets, particularly Russia and Latin America. In the United States, both volume and pricing were up slightly. We have seen modest improvement in consumption trends in the pet specialty channel, but the dynamics in this channel remained difficult. I am also pleased to announce that earlier this month, we closed 2 premium skincare transactions, PCa Skin and EltaMD. Both companies are delivering significant top line growth in the professional skincare channel and in e-commerce. Now we'll turn to our outlook for 2018. As stated in our press release, we expect net sales growth to increase mid-single digits in 2018. We expect organic sales to be up low to mid-single digits with improvement in our growth rate versus the second half of 2017. We are encouraged by our volume growth over the second half of 2017, and we plan for a combination of pricing and volume growth for 2018. On a GAAP basis, we expect gross margin to be up 75 to 125 basis points in 2018. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, we expect our gross margin to be up 50 to 75 basis points as a combination of pricing and productivity from our funding-the-growth initiatives should more than offset higher raw material costs. We expect another year of increased advertising spending in 2018, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net sales. We still see significant opportunity to spend behind our core brands, support new product launches and drive consumption in emerging markets. Now moving over to the impact of recent U.S. tax reform. On both a GAAP basis and excluding the impacts from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27% in 2018. We expect GAAP earnings per share to be up double digits for the year. Excluding charges related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and the onetime charge resulting from U.S. tax reform, we expect earnings per share growth to be around 10%. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So first, I just wanted to get a little clarification of your prepared remarks. I mean, you mentioned market share improved sequentially throughout the quarter. But I'm assuming overall market share result was less than you originally expected, particularly in emerging markets, given you mentioned the organic sales growth was weaker than you expected. So is that the right way to interpret your comments? Or were you trying to say that there's a lot of destocking going on at retail or at the consumer level? I just wanted a bit of clarification there. And hopefully, that doesn't count as a real question because the real question is more around organic sales and the slowdown we saw in emerging markets sequentially on a year-over-year basis or even more so on a two-year basis. It just seems pretty striking in the face of much higher advertising, the greater innovation you mentioned, the execution tweaks, et cetera, so it feels like something has changed here. So can you help me sort of understand the markets, you're trends in emerging markets, why we're not seeing more improvement, particularly given it looks like we're already seeing rebounding trends in developed markets? And then related to that, how does this sort of change the way you manage the emerging market business from here? Do you have to invest more on price, be more judicious with price increases, particularly given the Latin American pricing decline this quarter? Ian Cook : Well, thank you for the four questions, Dara. Where to start? I think I'll start with the bigger questions, which is the emerging markets and the market shares and growth. It's interesting, when you -- today, we're focused very much on price, if you take of the big picture view and go back over the last several years when transaction costs and commodity costs were forcing pricing, there was the reduction in the contribution of volume to the organic growth. And much concern expressed in terms of how to regain volume momentum and find that balance between pricing and volume. And in the emerging markets, that kind of effort never comes in a straight line, particularly when you have pockets of competitive activity maybe with competitors who also are in the developed world looking to challenge growth more aggressively in the emerging markets. So in terms of our business in those emerging markets, that's really the challenge. The challenge is the price versus the volume. John mentioned Brazil. And we have opportunities to fine tune our strategy in the emerging markets on price. We also have the opportunity in the emerging markets to react, too, particularly in Asia, the local brands where that innovation is at a significant premium to the average pricing in the market, which, obviously, drives the value of the market and then your performance from a share point of view. And we have a very broad portfolio because we service all consumers in those markets, the ones coming into the category, which John has talked many times, about our ability to get penetration and consumption up for the long haul and then trading them up the curve. So I think the second way we're thinking about the emerging markets beyond balancing price and volume is building that penetration and usage. I don't think it changes the way we think about the emerging markets at all, and that's why we are focused on those two things. What you do get in the emerging markets is, as you saw from John's comments about Saudi on the third quarter call and what we've seen in the fourth quarter, you get bumps along the way. They are not as predictable. Indeed, I'm not sure any of the world is as predictable as we might want it to be. And so these things aren't going to move in a straight line and regrettably, perhaps not as quickly as certainly you might want. So that would be my answer on the emerging markets. In terms of share performance in the fourth quarter, actually, we feel quite good about the share performance in the fourth quarter. Obviously, you have the difficulty in the developed world of the measured and the nonmeasured channels. We do quite well in the nonmeasured channels as well. I think the key thing in the developed world is the underlying category growth rates, and that's why we are encouraged, perhaps aided a bit, by our innovation and the investments we're putting behind category stimulation that we're starting to see that come back. If that continues to trend the way we have seen it coming out of the fourth quarter, I think that's going to be an important part of driving potential in the developed world. Operator : We'll go next to Jason Gere of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jason Gere : I guess, Ian, I was just wondering if you could talk maybe about overall company price deflation. I think this is the first time in maybe 6 years that we actually saw prices in negative. And I know from time to time, the U.S. and Europe have been a little bit more of an investment market. But usually, you've had the offsets in other markets. So as you think about that low to mid-single-digit growth, what's your outlook on total price as a contributor? And how do you balance that right now when you are seeing the rising, I guess, raw material prices? Do you take comfort that more of your portfolio is Personal Care versus household? Or I think you might be impacting a little bit more. So I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit of color around price and the impact on sales as well as margins. Ian Cook : Thanks. Let me use this opportunity to comment margin by doing the gross profit roll forward, and then I will come back to price as we think about it for 2018. So if we take the gross margin roll forward, the gross margin in the fourth quarter 2016 was 60.8%. Pricing in the fourth quarter of this year was a negative of 40 basis points. Interestingly, funding-the-growth and a very, very modest contribution from restructuring, together, offset a negative 2.6 points of material prices, the ones that I talked about earlier, basically, resins and cardboards packaging, and that led to the 40 basis points reduction year-on-year, although still north of 60% at 60.4%. The comment I want to make of this and then come back to pricing is we were very pleased with our funding-the-growth delivery in the fourth quarter. You know well, some tracking us over the years, that our funding-the-growth savings filled across of the year. But 260 basis points, 2.6 points in the fourth quarter is meaningfully higher than we tend to generate in historical years. Any point being that we have doubled down on driving funding-the-growth projects. And we think in that area of focus, we're quite well positioned for 2018. Now come back to pricing itself. Obviously, the biggest pressure on pricing, as you saw, was North America and, as it customarily is, Europe. The North America, we talked about some categories being under pressure from a promotional activity point of view, very specifically liquid hand soap and dish. And we said we were going to have to meet that activity in the third, and it continued into the fourth quarter. And we have seen a share response quarter-on-quarter positive for both businesses. And couponing was a factor for us in the fourth quarter as well as we edge pricing up in toothpaste. We think that the raw material underlying pressures will inform the marketplace in general about a need to ameliorate promotional intensity to be able to absorb those costs. And we certainly believe that in the emerging markets, we have the pricing power that we have always demonstrated to be able to offset those costs with pure price. And that is something we know how to do and we have done in the past. So it comes back to John's point about our growth in 2018 being a balance between volume and pricing. And we think we are positioned to be able to accomplish that developing markets we have done before, and on the other side, the funding-the-growth initiatives we have are deep and rich, and we leave 2017 with very good momentum in that space. And I would say, just to repeat, we are looking for our gross margin to increase by 50 to 75 basis points in 2018 in the face of the environment we're in. Operator : We'll go next to Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : So I'd like to drill on pricing and sharing return. Were you able to reinvest in pricing in Mexico and Central America? Or is that mostly concentrated in Brazil cash and carry? I asked in relation to your declining products in Mexico and Central America where volumes rebounded in Brazil and in June. So is that due to the new price instruction -- structure, sorry? Or is that related to destocking in some of your large clients in Mexico who happen to be also the U.S., your large U.S. clients, in many cases? So in other words, embedded in your top line guidance, are you expecting volumes to change slightly in Mexico, in Central America? And for you to recover a share, I'm assuming the household cleaning brands or the softener brands. So -- and how long do you expect the market share to improve in emerging markets? Ian Cook : Yes. I think, actually, we talk prices in some Latin American countries in the fourth. And in Brazil, there was a degree of price promotion, which, of course, led to a very good result for us. We have, as others have commented, seen destocking with retailers. You talked Mexico, specific to Mexico, and we think, when we look at our market shares with the combination of the advertising and the innovation, and the innovation is -- tends to be more at the premium end of things, that we will see growth, volume growth continuing and some price on top of that. Operator : We'll go next to Caroline Levy of Macquarie. Caroline Levy : Ian, you have talked a lot about funding-the-growth and the great success you have there. We saw another company announce a very, very deep restructuring, significant layoffs and plant closures and so on. Do you see opportunity to cut more aggressively go beyond funding-the-growth? Because it seems to me that the environment is such that getting gross margin improvement to the extent that you're looking for is going to be awfully challenging. So just any thoughts of other big activities going forward. Ian Cook : Yes. Well, Caroline, we fully endorse that notion. Indeed, we have been and continue with a very large restructuring program, which, when it's done by 2020, we'll see costs of about just under $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and savings between $0.5 billion and $575 million. And that's a very profound reassessment of how we go about managing our business. It's all to do with the linked capability that SAP gives us and our ability to reorganize how we get work done and reducing the duplication of work done in various locations. So it's a very proper question. It's a very important question. But indeed, it is a journey that we are on and have been on for a while. So we think it's appropriate, and it's something we are pursuing diligently and aggressively. Operator : We'll go next to Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Sunil Modi : Just one quick one. Ian, did you -- sorry, if I missed it, but did you comment on trade inventories and destocking? I'm just curious if you're seeing any and how long. If you are seeing it, how long it might last? The bigger-picture question is just, given what's going on in the environment and look, Colgate has been incredibly careful and, I think, responsible in terms of how you allocate capital and M&A, but it looks like the environment is really just tough for all CPG players. And I'm just curious, have you kind of thought about perhaps coming a little bit more overreaching in your M&A thoughts in terms of different categories and pillars of growth? Any thoughts on that would be helpful. Ian Cook : Yes. Always an appropriate question, Nik, and also an area of focus for us. We tend not to think about overreaching. We are quite broad in terms of thinking about where we might reach. I think, we think the recent additions of PCa and Elta skincare businesses are terrific acquisitions. These are very good technology, highly recommended skin health products with margins that are accretive, growth rates that are attractive and brands that use the recommendation model, of course, in their case, beauticians and dermatologists, to do what we have done so many years in Oral Care and Pet Nutrition. So your question is spot on. The challenge for us is what are the right assets. And I would say, when you think about use of our capital, clearly, when we think about the benefits of the tax legislation, our mind focuses on what we can do for growth, which is around capital investment that can drive growth organically and, of course, capital allocation that can acquire good businesses to further our category ambitions. And we think PCa and Elta are 2 such businesses. Operator : We'll go next to Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : I had a question on your stepped-up advertising. I guess, I'm wondering if you believe you're successfully reaching your consumers and adapting enough to follow the changing consumer behaviors. So in the context of that, how do you guys evolve your approach? And have you leveraged in social media more and or -- maybe differently? And then curious if you considered implementing a subscription-based model for some of your businesses, especially in light of some of the relatively new entrants that are doing that. I guess, I'm just really trying to get at how you're better communicating with and attracting consumers as behaviors and the retail environment is changing so rapidly. Ian Cook : Yes, Bonnie, all good questions, all areas of great focus and great focus with speed on our side. We're going to spend around 30% of our advertising digitally, and of course, that varies depending on the geography and the penetration of digital. The Hill's business is 100% digital, for example. And interestingly, with that business, you talked about subscription, we lead in Oral Care online in the U.S. and the U.K. and in China. And the Hill's business is extremely well developed digitally here in the United States. And to your point, given the quality of brand and the trust, consumers having those diets and what they can bring to their pets, today, over 50% of Hill's e-commerce purchases is subscription in the United States to exactly, as your point, the power of brand translated through the way people want to shop that category increasingly today. In terms of reaching consumers and engaging with them, I mentioned a little bit earlier in some of my opening comments about these consumer engagement centers that we have in the U.S. and China, for example, which allows us to track 24/7 what the consumers are engaging in online and insert ourselves into that conversation with the brand, take Colgate, that is very iconically all about a smile, all about building a future, a brighter future for the people that use our brand. So we can communicate and has built capabilities to communicate in 3 seconds, 6 seconds or 30 seconds and make sure that the brand's message and brand recall gets through that very cluttered environment. So absolutely, we are leveraging social, and I think we are moving ourselves into the space with speed and agility to do that quickly when you see trends emerge and make sure you stay relevant to consumers. And the last idea I would repeat is this Dare to Love brand codeveloped with that e-commerce partner, very familiar with the consumers in that space who can be younger. And indeed, that Dare to Love toothpaste that I mentioned earlier that we launched online in China did precisely that, took the Colgate brand to a younger female purchaser, and we use digital to do that as well. So it's not just message; it's who we are reaching with that message. And if I may, although you didn't ask it, but Nik did and I didn't answer that part of his question, we have seen some retail destocking. I mentioned Mexico. It's fair to say that here in the U.S., year-on-year, some of the bigger retailers have seen a reduction of a weakened inventory compared to last year. So yes, we have continued to see that and deal with that as others are as well. Operator : We'll go next to Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English : You may have just kind of answered it, Ian, but I was hoping we could just definitively sort of wrap up the line. I'm thinking a couple of questions. Your prepared remarks talked about end market acceleration, market share acceleration. They all sounded really a beat, but reported results are lagging. Is that simply a factor of kind of timing of when you're seeing the accelerations? Or are you referencing sort of leading indicators into the new year? Or is the way you saw on the fourth quarter in some of these transitory destocking issues, et cetera, prevented the full flow-through. And then second question, as we think into next year, your earnings algorithm, roughly 10%. It looks like you're getting kind of halfway there on just tax, and depending on your FX assumption, almost the rest of the way there on FX, despite organic sales growth and gross margin expansion. So is it fair to characterize next year as another year of outsized reinvestment back in the business? Ian Cook : Yes, Jason, I think the right way to think about our remarks related to the consumption in the fourth quarter is, indeed, leading into 2018. And we could go through factors about the sales versus the consumption. But the point, I think, is that we kept our advertising presence with better quality work behind growing relevant innovation. And we're beginning to see a marketplace response, not as quickly as people on the outside perhaps wanted. Indeed, a little bit shy of what we were looking for, which was not quite the same as the external. But from the consumption side of things, we're seeing a very definite measurable response, and we do think that bodes well in 2018 or for 2018. And as I have said at the end of the previous question, in certain parts of the world, destocking was a transitory piece of that. Relative to the earnings gross -- growth that we talked about for next year, in the release, we said low double digits earnings growth. John talked about around 10% on the call. And whenever I'm asked the question, what does low double digit mean? My answer is always 10%, but your characterization of it is not correct. The tax rate is not half of it and -- nor is foreign exchange the other half. I will say, as we think about the way we're talking about 2018, and to remind everybody, we talked about 3% to 5% organic on the top line, mid-single digits on a dollar sales basis. We talked about gross margin expansion of between 50 and 75 basis points. And we gave the tax range, legislation part, the new treatment to start compensation running through the income statement and said around 10% earnings per share growth. I will say that there is a modest part of the tax return being reinvested into the business quite deliberately, but we think the construct of that income statement and earnings flow is quite robust in the current environment. Operator : We'll go next to Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : I just wanted to build on Jason's question there with -- but -- with the guidance but as it pertains to advertising and marketing spending. So it would seem to imply that a healthy portion of the 50 to 75 basis points of gross margin improvement will be reinvested, so that advertising and marketing line starts to trend back closer to 10.5% to 11%. I think the high point for the company, if you look back a decade plus or so, it has been at 11%. So the question is really, is this sort of a reaction to the necessity to spend in the current environment? Or is this sort of a more permanent level of increase where it could be 11% or even north of that given a weak consumer, even including in emerging market? So any commentary there will be helpful. Ian Cook : Yes, Kevin. I mean, we think about advertising in a very disciplined way. It serves the purpose, and the purpose is to build our brands. And the purpose of building the brands, particularly in a lower-growth category environment and historically, is to make sure we develop and evolve and grow the market shares of those brands in country by country because that's where you grow them. So we don't think about it top-down as a ratio. We think about it bottom-up as an expense to support a portfolio of businesses and the innovation we are bringing behind those businesses. And for 2018, as John said, we have a plan, that's see the advertising up, absolutely, and on a ratio basis, and that's because we think the portfolio of brands, the quality of marketing technique and the innovation we have in 2018 will be responsive to that investment to drive the organic growth in that 3% to 5% range. So we think about it entirely in those terms. And will it go up in 2019? Again, we'll see what the plans are. Operator : We'll go next to Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Look, I appreciate all the efforts, Ian, that you described at the outset, the good 4 focus areas. You got to do those things. And to be fair, I thought lots of questions from the release, like the tax rate guidance seems high, debates on ad spend, Hill's, maybe Naturals not seeming to get traction yet, we've been hearing it for a while. But I wanted to take a step back and maybe, most importantly, talk about potential or apparent lack of pricing or maybe a negative ship in brand power for you. And are we -- I guess, the core question is are we here because Colgate has been milking the business a little bit over the past several years and overearning? And to your comments, a few questions ago, your commodities are up, yet pricing is negative. Plus, you're investing significantly back into the brand, the ad spend. But not only your top line that challenges your market share still, right? So now it's two years, 140 basis points lower according to your own numbers, right, the track on track, according to your own numbers. And again, this quarter, for all mission, looks like you're not gaining in Brazil and Russia and India and U.K., and France and China at least, and a lot of that to local competitors. So I guess, I'm struggling for confidence, as you can tell by the question, I'm struggling for confidence that things are getting better quickly here. And I guess, the easier comps and FX should help, but I just don't see signs of Colgate doing better underlyingly. And going back to the question I start with, could this mean we're in a longer period of reinvestment necessary to shore up the Colgate brand, the formally impenetrable Colgate brand and pricing power? Does this mean that Colgate has been significantly overearning, and we're here for years of reinvestment as opposed to, hey, Q4 looks better, so 2018 is going to be good and rock the races again? Does that help? Does that make sense? Ian Cook : It makes sense. I don't agree, but it makes sense. I mean, the words do. The -- I disagree, Ali, because come back to pricing in this fourth quarter, we're seeing to take a quarter and then project the world. But based on the quarter, if I took us back many quarters, the critique was no volume growth or price. This is a problem for brands in general. And as we have worked our way through 2018, supported by advertising, we have built back underlying volume strength into the business. As others have said on earlier calls, in some parts of the world with category growth being slower, which is an industry phenomenon, not a Colgate phenomenon, some people in those categories have invested, shall we say, aggressively in the short term to deliver a piece of the pie. And in some categories, we have made that choice. It is fair to say that commodities in the fourth quarter were up a little bit beyond our expectations coming out of the third, and I think that has been true for others as well. But I come back to our underlying model, our market shares in Latin America are strong. Our share opportunity in China and India with Naturals, which only went into the marketplace in the third quarter of last year, the initial reaction as I tried to suggest that the Russia example has been very good and is building the Colgate market share. So I think we know how to innovate against competitors, whether they be multinational or local. And I think that the underlying commodity cost pressures will bring some sobering thinker -- thinking to others who compete in the category. We have, back to the criticism of a few years ago, the strength of brand to be able to take pricing in the developing markets, when we do that, there will be a corresponding yin and yang with volume while we establish the new pricing. But we know how to do that. And along with funding-the-growth, that will be part of how we will deliver that 50 to 75 point gross margin improvement, a fairly healthy gross margin, while we maintain a resolute focus on the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in the last couple of years of that program, so we can reduce structural costs as well and focus on building our brands. So we don't think the model is broken. We think we have the brands, the innovation, the quality of engagement materials to meaningfully drive the business in 2018 and going forward. And actually, we are very pleased to see the positive and continuing reaction in markets such as Europe and North America. Europe, a part of the world that has been flat for quite a long period of time. So we feel okay about the business model, and we feel okay about the future starting with 2018. Operator : We'll go next to Wendy Nicholson of Citi Research. Wendy Nicholson : My question actually goes back to the 2 skincare acquisitions you made. And I know, a, short answer would be, \"Oh, they're so small. They don't move the needle. It doesn't matter.\" But I guess I'm struck sort of with the question of why bother? It's such a competitive category. It's such a crowded category. I feel like everybody and their uncle is buying these small dermatologist premium price skincare brands. And so just when I think of what is Colgate's kind of right to win in that category, I struggle with that. And I know there's an analogy, hey, we're going to be going to dermatologists the same way we go to veterinarians and to dentists. But at the same time, I mean, a lot of us has been to Topeka. We've been to New Jersey. We've seen your huge R&D facilities. And I've always thought of what makes Hill's and Colgate toothpaste special is how much technology and science you bring to the categories. And I just can't believe that you're going to be able to bring that from a real value added basis to the skincare category. So why bother? Is this a precursor to bigger M&A in that space? Or would you be better served even taking that relatively small dollar investment and putting it back into your core categories? Ian Cook : Yes. Well, thanks, Wendy. I mean, for the record, my uncle didn't buy any skincare businesses. These two we like for several reasons. They have, again, high recommendation levels. They have very good and proven technology, which is why they have the high recommendation levels. And a small as Tom's may have been and as small as some may have said a GABA was, we have learned a lot from those acquisitions in their respective spaces. So we think we get a technology -- we get technology learning and we think we can bring technology to those businesses. And the idea of, how would you call it, trickle-down science into a more mass skincare business is very attractive. And these are businesses that you can live wholesale to Australia and run the model with governing knowledge in those markets. So we think they are rich with opportunity, not just the businesses of themselves, but what we can gain from a technology point of view. Operator : We'll go next to Olivia Tong of Bank of America. Olivia Tong : I guess, if we take your word on Oral Care and the price pressure around some of your categories in pricing, maybe we can switch to the other 60% of your business. I mean, maybe Oral Care is okay, but what about the other categories, the home categories and the Personal Care areas in terms of your pricing power in those categories? Ian Cook : Well, we have pricing power in two ways in all categories. We have innovation, which is increasingly premium, which takes category and brand pricing up. And we have demonstrated that across categories, not just in Oral Care and even in tough markets like Europe with a fabric softener is we've seen a very strong end to the year with our supreme brand. And in the developing world, in general, we have brands that can carry price increases, I mean, straight price increases as opposed to reducing promotion and/or increasing mix. And we do that quite regularly. So on the Hill's business, that recommendation is a very powerful vehicle. And I think the testament to that for a product that is quite premium priced is the high level of subscription buying we see in the e-commerce channel, which is a fast-growing space for nutrition. So I mean, we always talk about the Colgate business and the toothpaste business, but we have brands that can earn their right across our portfolio in the world -- in the parts of the world that we have those businesses. Operator : We'll go next to Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : So building on some of what you said earlier, and you're absolutely right, in recent years, we were critical, many of us were, anyway, of the industry's potential overreliance on pricing to the detriment of volume. And now we're all harping on the opposite, the absence of pricing even the volumes are better. That's totally fair. But I guess, it's also about gross margin pressure. And I know you called out positive pricing gross margin targets in 2018. But the market, especially today, is obviously very concerned about the risk of an extended price more effectively brewing across HPC, just given the growth challenges that we've seen, the negative pricing and margin pressure, not only in your results, but in those with P&G and Kimberly-Clark early in the week. And I know you called out 50 to 75 basis points of gross margin expansion in '18. But I also think you were targeting like 150 basis points plus in '17 originally, and we finished essentially at 20. So I guess, the punch line is, what gives you the confidence that recent pricing intensity is really temporary versus more structural? And what's the risk that you see that you won't be able to fully offset -- or fully get the pricing you want in '18 such that margin aspirations may come under duress as heightened competition doesn't allow full pricing to flow through? And I guess, if I can just tuck on one more thing. Very specific to that, I wasn't sure how to interpret your comments earlier, should we extrapolate the negative pricing in Brazil that we saw in 4Q going forward as the cost of volume acceleration in 2018? Or was that really specific to the fourth quarter? Ian Cook : Yes, when we talk about pricing versus volume, again, I come back to the fact that finding the right balance is not a straight line. And we're always working to find the right balance. And we think we have that in our plan on a general basis in terms of this balance between volume and pricing. From a promotional point of view, we have seen some pockets, and we have felt the need to respond. I've mentioned the 2 U.S. categories specifically. But we think that the upward pressure on commodities, which wasn't at the level it is today in the third quarter, has definitely increased, will force people to reimagine how they engage with consumers beyond price in the developed world and in the emerging markets. As I've said before, we have the opportunity to price back to the balance that will see a diminution of volume until that new pricing is established, and then the volume comes back. So those tools, we believe, are there. When we think about gross profit beyond that, clearly, we have mixed opportunity within businesses back to the premium innovation. And as I said earlier, the PCa and Elta businesses may, indeed, be small, but the gross margins are attractive. So we see mix within businesses, and of course, we see mix between categories in terms of respective growth rate. We have that emerging market pricing power. We have promotional efficiency with the revenue growth management capability that we have underway. We have the funding-the-growth that I mentioned in the fourth quarter, fully -- 250 basis points of favorable in that quarter, fully offsetting the impact of materials in the fourth quarter. And all of that gives us confidence. And we start with guidance on gross margin for 2018, but it's 50 to 75 basis points because of the underlying commodity pressure, not 75 to 125 basis points in a more benign commodity environment. So we think we've been realistic, and we think we have the tools that will allow us to get there. Operator : We'll go next to Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : Just one follow-up, Ian, to something you said earlier. Maybe you could illustrate what you're seeing in the marketplace that merits investment. You mentioned you've already seen some signs of the market -- of some of your markets responding to the increased investment that you're making, that you're planning to make in 2018. If you give -- but that maybe not to the extent that you really wanted in 4Q, at least not everywhere. Could you give some anecdotes as to maybe one place where the marketplace is really responding to the -- I'm talking specifically about advertising investment in a way that you like and maybe one place where it's not? And what that's -- how you reacted to that as a company? Ian Cook : Thanks, Jonathan. Well, markets are different around the world. Again, we were actually quite pleased with the overall consumption in the United States given the currently slow start we had to the year. We're very encouraged by the progress we have seen in Europe as that builds momentum in other developed market that is struggling. And if you get behind all of those things, it comes back to innovation. It comes back to brand building, and it comes back to good marketing, in general, working with the retail partners in the countries. Colgate alone is not going to change the market growth rate in a country or category. But we think we can bring stimulation to that and be a part of what is hopefully a rebuilding of category growth rates going forward. But all situations are so country-specific that actually, it wouldn't be helpful even to go through one country example versus another. The principles are effectively the same. Operator : We'll go next to Bill Chapell of SunTrust. William Chappell : Hey, just a follow-up on the long-term targets. I understand and I think most of it is expected, kind of the change. But just how the company looked at it in terms of is there a fundamental reason why you can't -- the categories can't get back to 4% growth or you can't get back to 6%, 7% growth? I mean, I understand it hasn't done that in a long time. But certainly, it seems like we're seeing it kind of a global improvement in economies. You still have a pretty untapped developing market in terms of the Oral Care category. So is there some ceiling that you were seeing? Or are you just more prudent, it hadn't grown that way in the past 5 years, there's no point in forecasting it for the next 5 years? Ian Cook : Bill, life is interesting. We were captivated for the last 5 years for being unrealistic about category growth rates supporting a 4% to 7% range. We believe deeply in the growth potential of these categories. That's why we invest a fair part of our advertising investment into emerging markets where middle classes will grow because of the underlying economic trends you mentioned to get people to brush their teeth because that will build consumption and that will build marketplace growth. Our mental view and the way we think about it is we want to grow faster than the categories in which we grow business. If we look at where we are today, I guess, I come back to your word, we say prudence dictates with underlying category growth rates maybe now in the 2.5% range if the fourth quarter maintains, that gives us confidence for the 3% to 5%. But we believe deeply in the fact that these categories will grow. And if you look at them on an aggregate basis, e-commerce is another area that we'll continue to grow exponentially. I said we were just shy of 60% growth this year. So it's developing people into the habit, and it's connecting with people in the digital world of the 21st century and all of the other channels in between. So we have belief. We think prudence is called for now. And you can rest assure, if we can be a party to bringing category growth rates back, there will be nobody happier than us to elevate that 3% to 5% range. But the principal we think about is growing faster than the underlying growth rate of the categories in which we do business. Operator : We'll go next to Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : That's okay. We can take it off-line. Operator : All right, we'll move to our next question. We'll go to Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Just curious, what are you budgeting for oil prices for 2018 just in the model? And then just more broadly, competitiveness has been more pronounced in certain categories, maybe like Home Care and some Personal Care categories more than like Oral Care. I guess, I'm just curious, and maybe even following up on some questions earlier, how you think about the rationale today for continuing to play in some of those places where there is just more competition than in places like Oral Care and Pet where consumers are less likely to jump around? Ian Cook : Yes. Yes, the oral in our budget on average is in below 60s. Obviously, front-weighted, the way most forecasts are externally. When you think about business strategy, you have to come back to this concept of balance. There is no question we prioritize our businesses for the reason you assert, which is the emotional connection that consumers have, the trust that consumers have with products that they put in their mouth or their kids' mouths and their pets' mouths, hopefully, not their own mouths in the case Hill's, is extremely strong and deep. And that builds brand loyalty. It gives you pricing power, which gives you margin power and usually, growth. Then comes Personal Care, not quite as emotionally bonding but close. And we're very interested to go on this journey in the professional stage where you are solving a specific skincare issues with recommendation. And then Home Care, which, yes, is more of a grab-and-go business. It's a scale business. Brands still do well in parts of the world that we have them. And so as I've often said, if you have 4 kids, you don't love the fourth one any less than the first 3. So we have, over the years, as you have seen, divested modestly. Bleach, we have divested in some countries in the world where we think that brand can be better developed by another owner than us. But we're very happy with the business in the markets that we have them. They do very well. The U.S. under pressure on dish for the conversion reasons we have mentioned, that is building back. But taken as a whole, we like the business, and we will continue to keep the business in our portfolio. And remember, we are only focused on those four businesses. Operator : Sir, at this time, we have no further questions. Ian Cook : Thanks. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us, and we look forward to talking with you again after we close the first quarter, so bye. Operator : That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John. John Faucher : Thanks, Elysia. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are, Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Henning Jakobsen, Vice President and Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Vice President and Treasurer. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's Web site, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 6 and 6a of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's Web site. Ian Cook : Thanks John and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning. At CAGNY in February, I mentioned that we expected 2018 to be challenging of likely less challenging than 2017. So far, this has not been the case as quarter one was just as challenging as 2017 visualizing all material and logistics costs, heightened competitive activity and a slow down in cash [growth] [ph] in some markets around the world. I would say that in response, we remain focused on increasing our effectiveness and agility to better delay with this volatile environment where growth is harder to find. Over the past few quarters, I've highlighted four areas of focus as we look to accelerate top and bottom line growth. Advertising behind more impactful creative, innovation across our business particularly in toothpaste and particularly in naturals working with our retail partners to drive profitable growth with a focus on e-commerce, and of course, maximizing productivity up and down the income statement. These fundamentals remain our priorities in 2018. But on the call today, I'd like to focus on two topics; first, our developed markets where we think we've made progress over the past year. And second, our developing markets where we face some new and continuing challenges that we're working to address. You may remember in the first half of 2017, our North American and European divisions posted declines in organic sales and some weakness in market share since then it's driven by the increased advertising spend that we committed to and to focus on identifying the category segments and retail environments that will deliver growth, we have returned to organic sales growth and are back to positive market share performance. In the U.S., in the first half of last year our categories declined and we gained share in only one of our categories. In this first quarter of 2018, our categories are back to growth and our sales were up in six categories and flat in one more. This was a continuation of the improvement we began to see in the fourth quarter. In Europe for the second quarter in a row we are seeing broad based growth in sales and market shares elmex continues to drive premium growth in our toothpaste portfolio, while Sanex is driving share growth in personal care and Soupline is gaining share in the fabric softener category. Hill's has returned to sales growth with both pricing and volume growth in the first quarter. In the U.S. volume growth was positive in the quarter despite challenges in the specialty channel. Our Hill's e-commerce business in developed markets saw a 42% growth in the quarter. And so in simple terms developed markets deliver this quarter and we remain sharply focused on continuing this recent momentum. Turning to emerging markets, our emerging markets took a bit of a step back, so what are we seeing there and more importantly what are we going to do going forward to reaccelerate growth in these markets. Latin America category growth rates slowed in the first quarter due to lower levels of inflation repricing in markets like Argentina and Brazil. While volume growth slowed in Mexico behind some macro level concerns and some heightened competitive activity which in some cases we chose not to match. In Latin America, our pricing improved sequentially this quarter and that's a trend we expect to see continue over the balance of the year helped by easier comparisons as we cycle increases in promotional activity last year. We expect inflation to remain below historical levels, but we do foresee modest inflation given GDP growth increasing wages and rising commodity costs. In terms of reaccelerating volume growth in Latin America, we do have a robust plan in place for the balance of the year. We have a very active innovation calendar including in Brazil significant premium all care innovation in the high growth pharmacy channel. And John will discuss our strong Brazilian market share performance in his section. For personal care, we have innovation in the Protex line in bar soaps and in the Palmolive line in the naturals space. In Mexico where volume has been down for the last two quarters, we expect to see less of an impact from trade destocking. In Asia, we're beginning to see the benefits of our aggressive push into the naturals space where we are now rolled out across the geographies but we know we still have a lot of work to do. In the first quarter in Asia, our toothpaste market shares improved sequentially from the fourth quarter in four of our five largest markets. While in toothbrushes, our shares improved sequentially in all of our top five markets. In China, we are restaging our Colgate 360 brand, which is what we call Colgate Total in China and we are launching elmex as an e-commerce exclusive brand. In India, we are growing, but we need to improve our share performance and we are expanding our naturals Vedshakti platform by broadening the geographic reach and introducing a wider range of price points. Australia was in fact the biggest driver of our organic sales weakness in Asia-Pacific this quarter. We have been impacted by some difficult retailer dynamics in the market and we will begin to lap that in Q2. There has also been an increase in competitive activity that's putting some downward pressure on pricing and market shares. The Colgate naturals line is entering this market as we speak which along with some easier comparisons should lead to an improvement in Australia over the balance of the year. So real progress and momentum in our developed markets, which we are focused on continuing and in our developing markets, we have a clear understanding of what needs to get done to accelerate growth with specific plans and a sharp focus on results. And finally, I would like to compliment our team for a strong start to the year from a productivity standpoint. We achieved solid results on funding the growth which helped us offset the vast majority of our raw material inflation. And we saw limited impact from the increase in freight logistics in the United States as flexible programs like Uber freight and our new 4PL logistics provider enable us to limit our exposure to the higher spot market rates. And now back to John. John Faucher : Thanks, Ian. I will now provide a brief overview of the quarter including some further commentary on divisional performance. As Ian discussed while Q1 represented progress in net sales operating profit and earnings growth on a reported basis, our organic sales growth took a slight step back. We are focused on driving sequential improvement in organic sale through the balance of the year and the plans Ian highlighted demonstrate that focus. Our net sales growth of 6.5% in the quarter was the highest since the third quarter 2011. Net sales growth was driven by 2% growth in volume with 0.5% coming from our professional skincare acquisitions. Flat pricing and 4.5% benefit from foreign exchange. Our pricing performance improved sequentially by 100 basis points and we still expect positive pricing for the year as our pricing comparisons get easier and we plan to take some additional pricing to help offset raw materials inflation. On a GAAP basis, our gross profit margin was down 10 basis points year-over-year excluding the impact of our global growth and efficiency program it was down 40 basis points year-over-year. As Ian mentioned, our strong productivity savings lead they are funding the growth initiatives was unable to completely offset higher raw material costs. On a GAAP basis, our operating profit margin was up 40 basis points year-over-year in Q1 excluding the impact of our global growth and efficiency program, our operating profit margin was down 20 basis points as the decline in gross margin was offset by a 30 basis point decrease in our SG&A to sales ratio. On a dollar basis advertising investment was up 4% year-over-year in Q1, but was down slightly on a percentage of sales basis as we lapped our highest spending quarter in 2017. As Ian mentioned in the press release we are continuing to spend behind our brands in 2018 and we still expect advertising to be up for the full year on both the dollar and a percentage of sales basis. The remainder of our SG&A expense was down 10 basis points year-over-year as a percentage of sales as a moderate increase in our freedom logistics costs primarily in the United States was offset by savings from our global growth and efficiency program and funding the growth initiatives. On a GAAP basis diluted earnings per share of $0.72 was up 13% year-over-year in Q1 excluding the impact of our global growth and efficiency program diluted earnings per share was up 10% at $0.74. Now moving to the divisions we will start off with North America. As Ian mentioned we saw further improvement in North America in Q1 continuing the turnaround we began to see in the second half of 2017. Net sales growth was driven by our toothpaste business which showed strong balance through a combination of pricing and volume growth. Tom's of Maine also delivered double-digit net sales growth in Q1 benefiting from the continued positive trends in the naturals category. Our Canadian business delivered strong net sales growth as well in the quarter with growth across the oral care, personal care and home care. Ian covered most of the important details on Latin America. Latin America delivered 0.5% net sales growth in the quarter as volume was flat and pricing was up 0.5%. Foreign exchange was flat. As Ian mentioned, our market share performance in Brazil during Q1 was very strong, we gained one share point in toothpaste year-over-year almost two share points in toothbrushes and 3.5 share points in mouthwash behind the launch of Colgate Total 12 mouthwash. Moving to Europe. Europe delivered solid organic sales growth in Q1 with broad-based performance across our geographies and categories. Net sales growth of 16% was driven by 4% volume growth partially offset by a pricing decline of 2.5%. Foreign exchange was favorable by 14.5%. Our toothpaste market share growth in Europe continues to be widespread with share gains in France, Germany, Greece, Switzerland Austria and Denmark. The Colgate naturals extracts line continues to drive incremental sales across the division and we will be launching a new charcoal variant during the second quarter. We saw benefits from other new products in the quarter as well. We launched Coalgate Max White Expert Complete in the U.K., which has proven to be nicely incremental to our Coalgate Max White market share in that market. And Sanex continues to gain share behind the 0% line which we are expanding through the launch of Sanex 0% Lotion. This new line addresses an unmet need for moisturization with fewer chemical ingredients. Ian also discussed Asia Pacific, so I will simply add a few comments. Net sales in Asia-Pacific are up 5.5% in the quarter with all of the increase coming from currency as organic sales were flat. While our brick and mortar business in China was weaker than expected and we saw strong growth in e-commerce market shares and have market leadership in toothpaste in China e-commerce. The Africa Eurasia division reported net sales growth of 3.5% in Q1 as positive foreign exchange more than offset a decline in volume, while pricing was up low-single digit. The volume weakness was driven primarily by South Africa where we were lapping a difficult comparison. In Russia along with Colgate naturals which we had mentioned before we expect the recent launch of Coalgate Safe Whitening to boost market shares and expand the high margin whitening segment which is underdeveloped in the region. We are also very pleased with the performance of our 12 gram sachet in Africa particularly in Kenya. This package has a retail price point of 15 Kenyan shillings equivalent to US$0.15 or just over US$0.01 per usage. So consumers can purchase it with the change they have in their pockets. Along with our Bright Smiles, Bright Futures program, this is part of our long-term strategy to increase penetration and usage in emerging markets. And we'll finish up with Hill's. Hill's delivered 5.5% net sales growth in the first quarter. Volume growth at 0.5% was led by the United States, while pricing was up 1%. Foreign exchange was plus 4%. The United States volume growth was driven by continued strength in prescription diet business which is posting rapid growth in the online channel. as we highlighted at CAGNY. We were also excited about our new advertising campaign on our Science Diet brand in the U.S. which focuses on science being at the heart of biology base nutrition. Now we'll turn to our updated outlook for 2018. As stated in our press release, we expect net sales growth to increase mid-single digits in 2018. Given the slower start to the year we now expect organic sales to be up low single digits with sequential improvement in organic sales growth in the balance of the year versus low to mid-single digits previously. On a GAAP basis, we expect gross margin to be up 75 to 125 basis points in 2018 excluding the impact of our global growth and efficiency program, we expect gross margin to increase up to 50 basis points for the year. Greater than expected increases in raw material costs are the primary driver of our revised guidance. As Ian mentioned on our last conference call, our forecast does assume that some raw materials including oil trends lower in the second half of this year from their current levels. Our funding the growth initiatives are off to a strong start this year, we anticipate FTG will help us offset much of the raw material inflation. As I mentioned previously, we also expect positive pricing in the balance of the year which should provide a modest benefit to gross margin. We remain committed to consistent advertising across the year and we expect digital to represent about 30% of our media spending this year. Both on a GAAP basis and excluding the impact from our global growth and efficiency program, we still expect our tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27% in 2018. We expect GAAP earnings per share to be at double digits for the year. Excluding the charges related to the global growth and efficiency program and the one time provisional charge resulting from U.S. tax reform, we still expect earnings per share growth to be around 10%. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. Operator : Today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically for the telephone audience. [Operator Instructions]  We'll go to our first question from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Ian, I'd like to just in terms of the price increases that you embedded in guidance, so if you can explain how in the back-end of the year you're going to be able to raise prices given the elasticity we see in developed markets? Thank you. Ian Cook : Yes. I guess as we think about pricing Andrea and we talked about this a little bit on our last call. Clearly there is underlying commodity cost pressure that affects everybody. And clearly we have seen a slowing of category growth in some markets around the world and that has resulted in, in some cases is heightened promotional activity price space to try and get more of that smaller pie and that puts pressure on pricing. But as we said in the last call with the underlying commodity pressure with the inflation that we think will come back modestly in Latin America and other emerging markets, we believe there is the potential to take pricing over the balance of the year. We know we can do it from a consumer point of view and we think that other manufacturers are faced with the same cost pressures that we are faced with. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks in some instances where we thought the promotional activity was economically destructive we did not participate. So I think a combination of the underlying commodity price pressures, modest inflation and I would say an expected lessening and we're seeing that in some cases of promotional activity which is not a constructive way to build the business for medium term gives the potential for pricing over the balance of the year. On top of which by the way, we have John mentioned the naturals expansion much of that renovation while not technically an increase in prices is very much at a premium and of the category which obviously gives you the margin benefit of the elevated premium price inherent in our innovation grid. Andrea Teixeira : That's helpful, Ian. So just on the U.S. and probably like as you lap the price competition in Mexico is that a read into those key markets for you in terms of the pricing or the promotional spending kind of at least lapping in the fourth quarter of last year and being able to get in the balance of 2018 or better at least less couponing if you will on the pricing perspective? Is that the way we should look at it or list price increases? Ian Cook : Both, both. In the North American environment, I think you saw fairly substantial improvement from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in terms of our pricing. The same in Latin America. So we went from basically negative 1 to flat quarter-on-quarter. And we expect that progress to continue. And we will be taking some of this price increases in parts of the world to offset that underlying commodity inflation. And on top of though it is in the price measure our innovation flow is more at the premium end which will drive value and margin. Andrea Teixeira : That's great. Thank you, Ian. Operator : We will go next to Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning. Ian Cook : Hey Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So, Ian, I'm basically going to ask the same question I did last quarter which is, if you take a step back in emerging markets, has something really changed here because clearly your market share looks like it's under pressure despite the ad boost from the back half of last year, the naturals focus and your other strategy tweaks. And it's sort of odd to such a strong organization has not seen more traction in Europe consistently missing your own expectations. The organic sales growth is weaker than we've seen in history in emerging markets. And I appreciate some of the country specific commentary, some of the comments on category weakness. But again, taking a step back from an overall broader standpoint over the last couple of years, not just this quarter, it does feel like there's a pretty pronounced change in your competitive positioning in emerging markets. So I'm just hoping for sort of a state of the union at the high level on what's pressuring their competitive position. Why we should believe you can prosper versus the local competition that's clearly cropping up to a greater extent in that timeframe and how you sort of manage differently in the context of that environment? Thanks. Ian Cook : Well, a few things to say to all of that. Again, stepping back and taking the broader view, the issue we had to address and we're discussing often across last year coming into this year was the weakness in our developed world. And so, we are actually quite pleased with the progress we have made there particularly as the growth of our categories in those parts of the world is now moving back into a 2% range rather than the one or less that we were talking about before. So we think that's a very good, good progress. In the emerging markets, I challenge the notion of share weakening in fact as we try to demonstrate by going through some of our key markets. We are beginning to see sequential share progress in the key markets in those emerging countries. In a couple of cases, I mentioned in Latin America, we elected not to compete with promotional activity but those engineered it carried something like 11 gross margin. You can see volume and market share, we don't think it's economically rational to go chasing that kind of business. So you're making choices all of the time in those emerging markets. Emerging markets by the way where our market share is significantly advanced of our competitors. We've never ducked the fact that the local brands are having an effect in the emerging markets and we have said to some while that our response was going to be with naturals and naturals at a premium price because that was what was being effective in the marketplace. And we have now positioned our naturals offerings in those categories. I think the fundamental issue in the first quarter was the categories just slowed largely in Latin America because of an absence of pricing and you'll remember an awful lot of the near term growth in Latin America for all companies had been pricing driven. And in Asia, some destocking with the phenomenal growth of e-commerce particularly in China where by the way as John said, we are number one and building share and our e-commerce business was up some 67%. And behind all of that, when you do the rational work on, our people continuing to brush their teeth. The answer is yes and we continue to invest to bring new people into the category. So in terms of the category growth itself while it's slowed in the first quarter interestingly with the pick up in the developed markets our underlying category growth rate is about 2.5% and we expect those emerging markets to come back as pricing gets more rational. And meanwhile, we are sequentially building share and we are putting advertising behind it and we continue to have innovation behind it. We all wish these things moved in a straight line. But unfortunately, as I said on the last call they don't seem to. However, we don't think the model is broken and we think the same focus and activity and tools that we are deploying will be effective. Operator : We'll take our next question from Wendy Nicholson of Citi Research. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. Good morning. My question has to do with the U.S. market. First of all, the 5% sales growth that we saw, is it your read that there is any pipeline fill in that, is there any sell in that makes for a potential sequential slowdown in the second quarter inventory levels of trade et cetera et cetera. And then, the second question is, it feels like or it sounds like the growth in the U.S. has been driven or the recovery in your business in the U.S. has been driven more by your increased ad spending as opposed to really breakthrough or really meaningful innovation. I mean good innovation but nothing that's kind of like a total toothpaste or an [optic ride] [ph] or something like a big headline like that. And so can you just say is there anything specific to the advertising, is it just more dollars, is it more share of voice, are you doing more digital, is there something about the advertising that's making it particularly impactful? Thank you. Ian Cook : Thanks Wendy. First, I would say North America obviously is cycling a weak first quarter of the product here where we suffered from destocking and the sharp slowdown of the category. So I would say we benefited from that underlying category growth rate in North America is about 2%. But there is certainly nothing in terms of an inventory build because of the activity. I would say it's year-on-year comparison and the strengthening growth rate in the categories. And as I said earlier with the investment we are putting behind the business and the innovation which we can judge, however, we want to judge it in the end, the consumer is the final arbiter and if the market share goes up its good innovation in my book. So that's really the story on North America, but nothing that says the underlying business performance would be disadvantaged over the balance of the year. Now on the advertising side, you have to think about these things holistically when the advertising as we have said before is not just about advertising the innovation, but it is advertising the basic benefits of a brand. Indeed it is sometimes advertising what we call brand purpose which is what a brand stands for. So we can run advertising that we call equity advertising that is very simple, very basic in the emerging markets talking to people having a future they can smile about on subjects like education, on subjects like water conservation on a basic anti-cavity benefit which may not sound glamorous and wildly different, but it's extremely emotionally persuasive and I think what we have come to which we believe is making our advertising more effective is that we've got this balance between the emotional connection with the consumer and the rational connection with the consumers. Certainly the quality of our advertising is increasing. And then, you look at the shift we have made to digital which gives you a lot more information in terms of how you address consumers and that is playing a role as well. And finally, I would say this year we will have completed a journey over three years which has seen us reduce the amount of money we spend in what we call non-working media by something like 15%, I'm sorry 25% to 30%. And of course that money then gets directed into what we call working media which is advertising consumers actually see. So in the same advertising to sales ratio, you have a shift of money away from non-working into working. So you get that additional benefit as well. But I think it's the type of advertising, it's the vehicles we're using for the advertising and that alongside the innovation. So it's not just throwing money, it is doing it in an intelligent way with a focus on making sure we have quality advertising vehicles with that money. Operator : We'll take our next question from Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : Great, thanks. Two fairly quick ones, if I could. I guess, the first as you mentioned at the outset, Ian, you started-off like CAGNY presentation saying that you had seen or you saw improving 2018 in terms of top line growth and that just suggested to me that we were off to a slightly better start to the year than we're seeing today. So I guess the first question just did you see something happen late in the quarter that might explain that or is this representative of the improvement you expected because it seems just a bit of a disconnect there? And then, on the gross margin outlook if I could, I think you said up to 50 basis points assuming some sequential reversal of oil from here. And I guess the question there is without cutting into investment spending how much flexibility do you foresee in the model this year if commodities don't cooperate. Thanks. Ian Cook : Yes. Frankly, Steve which we did from CAGNY sea changes, actually the developed markets played out pretty much the way we would have expected. It was really in the emerging markets and it was this pricing activity which stepped up as the quarter unfolded and we had to take a position in terms of, would we respond or would we not respond? That took pricing out of the category, which led to the slowdown in the value growth rate of the category. So yes, it did unfold after CAGNY to our disappointment. Look in terms of flexibility on the year, we have the last year about global growth and efficiency program remaining and we have a very strong funding the growth program off to a very good start this year. Six new areas of fundamental development and funding the growth, which we are now tracking beyond the usual, and of course the pricing that I mentioned earlier. So we're working all of the internal angles to give us flexibility across the back half of the year, if our commodity forecasting does not pan out the way we expect it to, will obviously be close to how that unfolds as the year progresses. But we're pressing in all of the areas you would expect to give us the most flexibility we can get because as we said in the release, we are committed to increasing our advertising absolutely and as a percent of sales because of the quality of innovation we have and we believe the quality of advertising vehicles that we have across the portfolio. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good morning folks. Ian Cook : Hi, Jason. Jason English : Thanks for let me ask a question. I've got one quick follow-up and then another question and I will try to jam in here. First, follow up on Dara's question, I think you pushed back Ian on his assertion that your market shares were softening somewhat in emerging markets. In your prepared remarks you certainly talked about the momentum and strength in some of your largest developed markets. Yes, when we look at your market share data that you guys disclosed and just look at toothpastes globally, it's down year-on-year. It's weakened from where you are -- what you last gave for fiscal '17. How do we put those two? And then, my second question is on Hill's overall, a lot of moving pieces in the U.S. pet landscape a lot of competitive turbulence, a lot of channel turbulence, a lot of it seems really reminiscent of P&G and [IEMs] [ph] with what General Mills is trying to do with Blue Buffalo that clearly creates some opportunities for you guys then. I know the landscape is a little bit different where the growth is, it shifted from pet specialty into online today. But is there reason to believe that some of this turbulence could once again create opportunities for you like it did back then? Ian Cook : Well, let me take the second and then come down --come back to the first. On the Hill's strategy and model we have been very disciplined over the years as you know we have two businesses there, we have a wellness business for general use and we have a prescription business against specific conditions in pet. And we have limited our distribution to those outlets that have advisers for the consumers that allow them to make an intelligent choice. And of course, in the case of prescription respond to a script from a vet, interestingly e-commerce is a perfect channel for us because you can write anything you want and [patent as] [ph] we did all because they're absolutely fixated on the health of their pet. So given the scientific quality of the Hill's products, given the scientific benefits that has been demonstrated clinically and given the discipline we have in maintaining that connection with that we obviously are working very hard to take full advantage as we can of any opportunity in that landscape. One hates to predict that we will be doing our level best to do that. In terms of the market shares globally, yes the dollar share is down modestly actually the volume share on our business is effectively flat year-to-date year-on-year. And some of that pressure traces to Latin America. Because I mentioned that we had walked away from some promotional activity and what we are now seeing in the emerging markets I think we talked about it in fact that sequentially two places up in four of the five largest markets and toothbrushes up in all 5 from the fourth quarter. So again, we think the plans we're putting behind the business are making progress and we will keep driving that over the balance of the year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. I just have a few follow on questions. First, in North America wondering how much of the volume left in the quarter was driven by mixed impact via innovation and then realistically how sustainable is the strong growth that you had in the quarter given all the headwinds you mentioned this morning. And then commentary we've been hearing from others. And then, just a quick question on local competition in emerging markets and I realize you guys are working to innovate as a means of competing more effectively with some of the local competitors, but you guys think that's going to be enough. And have you considered being more proactive with M&A as ways to be more competitive in some of these markets. Thanks. Ian Cook : Yes. Let's start with your first which is -- with North America. There's nothing substantively different in terms of the mix of the business coming into this year. I think the two fundamental factors are, the year-on-year comparison where we had a weak third quarter last year because of the slow down of the categories and the attendant inventory destocking as retail. So you've got a rebound in category growth which started in the fourth quarter and is now at a reasonable 2% underlying growth rate. We've got good quality innovation as we plan to have every year and we are building market share because of that innovation and because of the expenditure behind quality advertising in the business. But it would be fair to say that the first quarter itself benefits from year-on-year comparisons, but looking forward there is nothing about the underlying strength of the business that concerns us for our planning point of view over the balance of the year. And then, in terms of local competitors in emerging markets this is a journey, we have said when we started talking about naturals some time back that these offerings were at a premium price points. We think we have shaped some very interesting bundles although we talk about naturals in kind of a generic sense actually the offerings we have vary across the world to reflect local market preferences. And we are seeing progress; it's not going to be overnight. And I think it would be fair to say in the broadest sense Bonnie in terms of M&A look at what we have done over the years with Tom's of Maine or even the elmex brand in Europe, which had a dominant position in the Germanic countries. Certainly, if there are quality assets Tom's and the Gaba would have been a local brand in that definition. The relationship we have with Darlie in Asia is another local brand in that regard. That would certainly not be of a strategy in -- that would certainly not be off strategy. And interestingly a little bit of an aside, the Elta business one of those two personal care companies that we've bought is building -- has built a very strong business in China as an e-commerce business. So in addition with them, we are learning some interesting skills in building direct to consumer businesses online in China with imported product. So not completely off the list of possibilities Bonnie. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Hey, good morning. Ian Cook : Hi, Kevin. Kevin Grundy : First, a detailed oriented question, so the industry growth rates now in emerging markets which you indicate are slowing. Do you have a specific number for us? I just would like a sort of a point of reference relative to the 0.5% organic sales growth in the quarter. And then, the broader question in emerging markets, are you comfortable with your investment levels in those markets, you have very attractive margins not every company can say that in some of these regions and is it possible that the cost of business is moving higher, investment levels need to move higher to compete with some of this local competition just to return Colgate to some of the growth rate that it's enjoyed in the past in some of these regions. So your comments there would be helpful. Thanks. Ian Cook : Yes. Yes. Again, our -- how would I say our understanding of the slowdown in the emerging markets is not that we see this as a permanent slowdown, but as I mentioned before in the developed world, we have now seen category growth rates move up into the 2% range historically they had been one and lower. So that's good news. In the emerging markets what we saw was mid-single digits move down to something in the 2.5% to 3% range. And then, of course you have the destocking that goes with that kind of slow down. And largely, that was in most markets pricing driven because of that promotional intensity that I mentioned. Now the underlying usage of consumers is the same. And interestingly, if you profile our categories around the world and our geographic mix, if those emerging markets were to stay at 3% let's say, and the developed world at 2%, if you look at our mix of the world, our underlying category growth rate would still be 2.5%, if as we expect those emerging markets come back because we will have the opportunity to price and given our strength and the category that will lift the value of the category then you could expect the underlying market growth rate will move north of 2.5%. Now from an investment point of view, when we think about advertising as I have mentioned before, we do it from the bottom up. And so we do it by geography, by activity, by product in our portfolio and that ends up in a ratio, we don't work the ratio down through the income statement. So our first quarter advertising was slightly off the highest of last year on a ratio basis happen to be higher than the average of last year. And you can imagine in our priority markets, it is higher still and we think and believe certainly from a share of boy's point of view and a consumer engagement point of view we have an adequacy certainly of investment in those market places we need to capitalize on e-commerce, which I think we're saying we are doing and we need to continue to build these naturals offerings around the world in the emerging markets. But I think it's more building what we have than the need for absolutely more dollar investment. The pleasing thing with much of this innovation in the emerging markets now is that -- it's at a premium level which gives you investment opportunity underneath that. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hey Guys. Ian Cook : Hey Ali. Ali Dibadj : Hey. I guess I'm still a little confused about what Colgate's on a root problem is. Despite all the micro positives you described in the prepared remarks and some confidence here and certainly some conference, the CAGNY conference results are clearly not what you expected, not what we expected, they're pretty tough, right? And I get that you can blame the category growth, but consistently as you tell your competitors as well when you are 40% plus of the category and in the series of leaders. And instead, we're actually starting to hear kind of different things from you guys saying something and then what we've seen the numbers is slightly different. So advertising I guess we were seeing for the year. I do when I get the bottom up approach but advertising was supposed to be up as a percent of sales already, right? It's not, it's actually down. Gross margin is 50 to 75 that it was now up to 50 and commodities frankly from CAGNY haven't changed that much. FX has gotten better and should have helped you on gross margins. We thought top-line certainly from our previous discussions would accelerate already. Top-line is decelerating, pricing those supposed to be up, remains challenging, your comps get tougher here. Innovation was already supposed to help, but dollar shares are actually down in India, China and U.K. and Russia and Mexico where we were hoping innovations would help. And this isn't kind of a temporary thing it sounds like it doesn't sound like they're one-timer or like we'd heard about last year. It sounds like it might be tougher longer term and that's a struggle, personally if I look at the stock today, I guess I think you guys dodged a bazooka, I was going to say bullet, but I think you guys dodged the bazooka a little bit because investors are starting to I guess they're continuing to blame the things that are out of your control. But a lot of things are in your control aren't coming in like we expected. And so, I guess going back to the core question, I just -- I'm still scratching my head about what the root cause of the issues are. You can talk about one-off things that we're trying to do but I struggles with the root causes. And should investors continue to give the stock -- the generous benefit of the doubt it's been getting so far and why? Ian Cook : That's it. Don't know where to start really. I think in business in general you have to put everything in context. You make the assertion that these are root problems with the company. We pay pretty close attention to the pressures others in our space and other spaces have in this operating environment. You challenged on the fourth quarter this notion of pricing being negative and the underlying question was with pricing negative. Would this put pressure on margins, and therefore, in addition to the share commentary the model could no longer be effective. So we have tried to explain that the pressure point was the developed world which is where everybody has been focused. We feel quite pleased with the progress over the 18 month period and we think those two businesses and the underlying category growth is favorable for us going forward. And then, we end up with this heightened activity in some emerging markets pressing price and leading to category slowdown. And you make some choices that in some cases we chose short term not to chase economically we thought unviable volume and you take a short-term share hit and you take a volume hit. Faced with the same set of circumstances, we would on balance make the same decision. And when we look at the shape of the structure of our business we see pricing now flat which is not common in our industry space. We thought the gross profit we would have liked to have done better if we had pricing. But we thought that was quite contained and we kept very competitive spending on the table running through the income statement. We never said that the spending was going to be up on a ratio basis starting January 1st. We said we were going to increase our spending and keep that money on the table to build the business. So when you break these things down, unfortunately, there is no simple single silver bullet that says problem solution you have to manage many moving parts. And as I have said before this is not moving in a straight line that the underlying consumer behavior is still there. The medium term growth potential we have with a growing middle class in the emerging markets is still there. We have an innovation profile to allow us to build market share in those categories while we now have strengthened our developed countries. So, while the first quarter was not what we expected, which it seems to me we were in reasonable company in that regard. We think the plans we had for the year allow us to deliver the progress that we have committed to for the year and the underlying consumer behaviors are still sound and solid. And we have brand strength to compete. Operator : We'll take our next question from Olivia Tong of Bank of America. Ian Cook : Olivia? Olivia Tong : Hi. Can you hear me? Hello? Ian Cook : I couldn't but I can now, yes. Olivia Tong : Okay, perfect. My question goes back to North America because obviously that was quite a bit better than many of us had expected and certainly better than what track channel data would have implied. So were there particular categories that drove this particular more off obviously in untracked and tracked. And flipping a prior question in the other way did retailers destock too far in the past and now they're actually restocking back to normal levels? And then following on that, North American pricing looked obviously better and given what Procter's said about Kress last week would be curious what your view is on North American pricing from here. Because just in our channel checks both online and off, we're seeing some pretty meaningful price promotions particularly with larger packs at the premium end. So we just love your commentary on that. Thank you. Ian Cook : Yes. Again, I think North America is largely influenced by the year-on-year comparison. Last year the categories were declining and retailers were destocking. And we saw in their organic growth decline mid-single digits. This year, the category -- the underlying category growth rates have moved up into the 2% range, healthy for developed world standards. We are building our market shares in six categories are flat in one more. And we have put advertising behind that to do that. And we have -- we said in the fourth quarter we had reacted to some pricing in category specific challenges and we've managed intelligently to we think handle that in a balanced way. So the underlying category growth rate in North America is around 2%. And as I said earlier, we don't expect anything to change that underlying strength of our now re-established North American business. Interestingly from an inventory point of view we continue to see retailers work down inventory but on our businesses for this quarter in a more measured way or a more modest way than we saw in the first quarter of last year when the categories were actually in decline. But the quest for efficiency is still very much there and we participate year-on-year with retailers in that regard. Operator : We'll take our next question from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Ian Cook : Hi, Nik. Nik Modi : I just wanted to ask you - hi, how are you. I just wanted to ask a question about culture, I mean Colgate has historically been known to be a very thoughtful company as it relates to capital allocation and just business strategy in general maybe on the conservative end. And that was -- that worked well, your returns are high and margins are high, but the environment is changing dramatically and business as usual doesn't seem like it's working. So I was just curious on your thoughts as the CEO of this company and culture and risk tolerance and how you think about that Ian Cook : Well, very carefully, I guess is the first answer. We realize the world is changing, but we think we need to be disciplined in managing our company over time. In other words, we think this is an era for urgency, but not a panic. And so it's easy to throw out a lot of what I say make work to window dress the issues we're all dealing with. And we still very much believe in the fundamentals and in the fundamentals of these kind of businesses where people use your products every day, the benefits the product provides are important to their health and wellness not their everyday usage of products. So you need to build brands and you need to find ways of making a connection and you need to find ways of bringing the next generation of users into the business. Now that is being disrupted in no end of ways, how would you communicate, how would you sell, and so on. And we think -- we're doing quite a lot in all of those areas with a view to building our brands and building value while we do that. Now our risk tolerance in capital allocation is, I think quite balanced. I think we have demonstrated if you take the M&A space for example, I think quite a good track record of identifying good quality assets bringing them into the portfolio and building them over time and in building them building the overall company. We continue to be very focused in that area like much else in life, it does not move in a straight line and we do not choose to be cavalier and panicky in the allocation of our capital in that regard. That may not be a fashionable thing to say today, but we think in terms of the underlying health of the company, it's the right position to take. So urgency we get and we are changing and have been changing a lot of things with this restructuring program we started a few years back and we continue to change a lot of things, but we resist the temptation to panic and make work for effect rather than for the long-term health of the business. And we're always trying to balance the long-term with the short-term. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Good afternoon. Ian Cook : Hey, Bill. Good afternoon, yes. Bill Chappell : Ian, can you just talk a little bit maybe about trends since the end of the quarter, I guess talking about growth rebounding as we move sequentially through the rest of the year. Didn't know if you've seen a bottoming out kind of in emerging markets and also maybe with that a little more color on Australia. I know that's been weak for quite some time with the retail landscape. So didn't know if something changed intra quarter, or it's more we're just going to be lapping kind of the changes as we move into next quarter. Ian Cook : I'm afraid Australia has been a case literally of as you know the two major retailers there control much of the marketplace. And there has been I would say a battle for shoppers between two of them. And we have from a joint business planning point of view trying to be accommodative but disciplined and we think we will finally cycle that by the end of the second quarter. I guess that's the simple way of saying that In terms of trends, all I can say is, the second quarter has started a better click for us and that I hope traces to category information which is as you know we see on a lagged basis and I can't offer any comment at this time. Operator : We will take our next question from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning. Thanks very much. I wanted to dig in on China. It's been a little bit of a tough market for a while and particularly called the volume decline and it struck me that I know China historically has been a real high e-commerce adoption market. And I was wondering if you could comment about your performance in e-commerce in China versus the market broadly. Are you doing better or worse there? Is there anything related to that that's created challenges for you and does that tell you anything about any other markets, maybe strategies you've deployed there or experiences you have had that might be an indicator of what e-com development looks like in other markets? Thank you. Ian Cook : Yes. Good question, Jonathan. It's interesting in our Hill's business e-commerce is an important part of the business in the developed world, North America and Europe. In the traditional Colgate business, the growth of e-commerce has been relatively modest, I would say in the developed world so far even though we are deploying resource against it. But in China, it has been quite explosive as you have Alibaba and Tencent and frankly 80 other platforms in China to go after from an e-commerce point of view, I think I mentioned earlier our Asia e-commerce business which is largely China was up some 67%. We lead from a market share point of view e-commerce and indeed have made sequential progress month-on-month in terms of share increases this year. And I think interestingly two things to say in terms of skills. Number one, we believe we can and we are working very hard to do this build a very important part of our business in China with imported products. So marketplace direct to consumer like the Gaba products, elmex that we have just brought to China like a pallet toothbrush that we have brought to China. And like the Elta product, I was mentioning earlier where actually they have people they work with distributors in China that have very good capabilities. So the thrust of your question is the right one which is that we think there's lots to learn in China. It's an important part of where we are focused and we are thinking about it quite broadly beyond even the businesses we sell pure brick and mortar in China and we're doing it as a business building exercise, but of course it becomes a bit of a learning lab as well. And we can transfer those learnings and those skills to other parts of the world. Operator : We will take our next question from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Thank you. Ian Cook : Hey, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Hey. So it wasn't great, I wanted to just talk one thing we haven't touched on yet which is and we don't talk about much which is the personal care and home care businesses and I just been wondering a little bit perhaps about I guess one kind of broad strokes like share performance in those businesses in emerging markets, if the competitive environment has changed for those at all? And then I guess also underlined that in Mexico when you talked about some of the competitive activity you chose not to participate in what category that was in? Ian Cook : Yes. Well, I would say the personal care business is in relatively good shape. We have strong brands. We talk about Sanex. We talk about Palmolive's. We have the Protex brand. And then in homecare, we have different brands in different categories. But our primary two categories are fabric softener and the dish liquid. Now when you look at the competitive activity in Latin America, oral care was one business, but then homecare was the other business because from a pure volume point of view, the purchase frequency of homecare products is higher than the purchase frequency of personal care products. If you're looking to drive volume from promotion that is a shorter term play. So we indeed did see a stepped up promotional activity on the homecare businesses. And again, we decide whether to play or not to play and if the margin is destructive and then frankly we don't. And we will rebuild the businesses with the innovation flow that we that we have. So that was a factor in Latin America. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing comments. Ian Cook : This is Ian. Thank you for joining the call. And we look forward to reconnecting with you after the second quarter. Thanks. Operator : That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Ian Cook : Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. As you read in our press release earlier on, for us the second quarter was indeed a challenging environment. As you know, rising commodity costs and volatile exchange rates put pressure on our P&L. And we are sometimes questioned if we're responding with an appropriate sense of urgency.  I will say that our plans and programs for the balance of this year and 2019 all will develop with urgency in mind. As a company, we focused on being smarter and faster in everything we do and working to build agility throughout the company and of course with our partners to deliver results. Today, I'll focus on three areas that I think exemplify the steps we are taking and then I will close with some specific comments about pricing. The first area of focus is making sure we are connecting with consumers in traditional advertising vehicles and increasingly digital vehicles with engagement materials that are compelling and pervasive. And also making sure that our products are available for folk to purchase wherever they may shop. And as you all know; the retail landscape is changing dramatically, and we have made and continue to make changes to address that. In our traditional channels, we've expanded our focus on formats where we feel we have incremental opportunities for growth, like this counters and pharmacy. We've also been aggressive in gaining access to new avenues of distribution to expand the availability of our products.  Not surprisingly, a primary area of focus is e-commerce which while only mid-single digit percentage of our overall sales is a key growth driver and particularly important for some key businesses. For example, in the past year, we've seen increased e-commerce availability for our Hill's Prescription Diet brand, which has enabled us to gain market share in the therapeutic segment while still ensuring that we maintained a strong relationship with the veterinary community. Through learning from EltaMD, we are expanding cross-border distribution into China for Colgate-Palmolive brands from other geographies all through e-commerce.  And this provides us another platform to build out at e-commerce business in this crucial market on top of that B2B and B2C platforms. This channel flexibility is an especially important tool in our efforts to preimmunize our portfolio in China and grow market share. As most of you know, we also recently took an equity stake in the direct-to-consumer company Hubble. Our collaboration with Hubble provides expertise in the digital channel and the platform for us to launch several incremental direct-to-consumer offerings, providing us with the ability to enter new segments. We launched our connected toothbrush in Apple stores in the U.S. earlier this year. And this month, we are launching in Apple stores across Europe. And while we\u2019re just beginning this journey, a journey that Hubble will also be able to help us with, we think connected health is a significant long-term opportunity for us in this digital world as we look to integrate consumer behavior, the profession and other interested parties to improve health outcomes across the world, and you\u2019ll be hearing more from us on connected health in the future. And finally, our recent acquisitions of EltaMD and PCA also give us and entre into thousands of spas, dermatologists and aestheticians across the U.S. with the potential for further product and geographic platform and a base on which to continue to build our ambitions in skin health. The second area I want to discuss is about providing consumers with what they want to buy as we focus on their changing tastes and of course that speaks to accelerating innovation across our portfolio. And we have a broad strong array of planned innovation out of the balance of this year and next. Let me talk today about one of our key innovation initiatives, Naturals, especially, but not only in toothpaste. Rest assured, we will be back to you on other important innovations when we are ready to make them public.  On Naturals, we are making progress in our rollout across the world. We\u2019re now in 44 markets with the Naturals offering. And we expect to launch in an additional 32 markets by the end of the year. In toothpaste, we\u2019ve launched Naturals in every hub in Asia and broadly across Europe. We will launch in Latin America and Africa Eurasia through the balance of the year. Importantly, these products sell at a meaningful premium in almost every market which will help deliver positive mix. Market shares are growing and repeat rates are strong, giving us the confidence to invest in generating more trial in the future. Importantly, through our consumer innovation centers, which are based in the markets they serve, we\u2019re able to customize these products for local tastes. While Naturals is a global trend, each market has its own interpretation whether it\u2019s ingredient-based like Swarna Vedshakti in India or more of a specialized Naturals product like our Tom\u2019s of Maine in the U.S. and Canada. And Naturals is not just about oral care, in personal care, we\u2019re seeing significant success in the free form sub-segment with Sanex Zero and Palmolive Nutritionist [ph] is a line of natural products across our personal care categories in Mexico and Brazil that is being rolled out across the rest of Latin America. And even in Pet Nutrition, we\u2019ve just launched our new Hill\u2019s Bioactive Recipe line, which is seeing a very strong response from some of our pet specialty partners in the U.S. In Oral Care, we\u2019re also very focused on competing more effectively in the Premium Therapeutic segment of the category and have recently launched the elmex brand in two entirely new markets with the full line of products. This marks the first geographic expansion of this brand outside Europe.  As I mentioned at the Bernstein conference, elmex has been launched as an e-commerce exclusive brand in China. And as we mentioned at the Deutsche Bank conference, we have also launched elmex into pharmacies in Brazil. The third area of urgency, I will touch on briefly, is one I think, you know well, the streamlining of our structure and building new capabilities. We talked about the benefits of having before and we continue to utilize our health structure, the raw innovation out more quickly across the divisions while adjusting our cost structure accordingly.  And we have also realigned our entire supply chain structure and streamline processes like our work approval and the creation of SKUs.  Colgate business service centers, as you know, we have three serving the world while fully deployed are still rather new and we continue to believe there are future opportunities to build further capability while lowering costs, even more.  Speaking with capabilities, we are rapidly building our revenue growth management tool, which will help us better partner with the trade to increase our average selling price with less reliance on pricing only coming from commodities and foreign exchange.  Finally, as I said, I\u2019d like to talk from the subject of pricing this year, which is obviously a challenging area for our company and our industry right now. As you can tell by our gross margins performance and by the performance of many of our peer companies, raw material inflation is putting pressure on gross margins, accounting for a 320-basis point headwind to our gross margin in the second quarter of this year.  It's important for us to offset this pressure with productivity and pricing as we do not want to reduce our brand support to offset these headwinds.  Taking pricing as we know in the first half has been in the phase of a challenging, competitive promotion environment in many markets and works for, in several of the emerging markets low inflation.  Obviously, the news in commodity pricing and foreign exchange will drive that underlying inflation. So, as we move into the second half, we have already put pricing in place in many markets around the world, particularly in emerging markets. But also, in some developed markets and at Hill's.  Given the current promotional activity, we may not see competitors follow immediately and we may intent to remain rational. But, we also understand the need to protect our market shares.  At this point, we're only expecting a modest sequential improvement in our pricing for the second half of the year, but along with our productivity programs which have started strongly, we believe this will allow us to improve our gross margin performance over the balance of the year.  So, while the environment remains challenging, we\u2019re working with focus adjacently and real urgency to improve our results, consistent with our long-term strategies. We will continue to invest behind our brands, deliver consumer led innovation with compelling communication material and drive productivity up and down in the income statement.  And now, I\u2019ll turn it back to John. John Faucher : Thanks, Ian.  We delivered net sales at 1.5% in Q2. Volume grew 1.5% including the negative 50 basis point impact versus our plans from the Brazilian trucker track. Our recently acquired professional skin care businesses, EltaMD and PCA skin contributed 100 basis points to volume growth.  Pricing was flat year-over-year, as we found little incremental pricing in our categories and higher levels of promotions. The recent strengthening of the dollar negatively impacts our net sales and profits. And the result to one exchange which had been a positive impact for several quarters was neutral to net sales growth this quarter.  At current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind to net sales growth in second half of the year. On a GAAP basis, our gross profit margin was down 90 basis points year-over-year. Within the impact of our global growth and efficiency program, it was down 140 basis points year-over-year. Our strong productivity savings led by our funding the growth initiatives were unable to completely offset the higher raw material cost Ian mentioned.  On an absolute basis, advertisement investment was up slightly year-over-year in Q2. On a percentage of sales basis, advertising was even with Q1 and with the year ago period. Excluding the impact of our global growth and efficiency program, the remainder of SG&A expense was down slightly year-over-year in Q2, absolutely and of the percentage of the sales. As an increase in freight and logistics was more than offset by a reduction in overhead expenses. We estimate that for the balance of the year, the impact from higher freight and logistics costs will be similar to the impact we saw in Q2. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share of $0.73, were up 24% year-over-year in Q2. Excluding the impact of our global growth and efficiency program, and the benefit from a foreign tax matter, diluted earnings per share were up 7% at $0.77. We estimate that the Brazilian trucker strike had a $0.01 negative impact on our earnings per share, versus our expectation at the time of the first quarter conference call, movements in foreign currency on a translational basis reduced our earnings per share in the second quarter by $0.02. Now, we\u2019ll go to North America. Net sales in North America increased 8% in the quarter, with our recent professional skin care acquisition is contributing 5.5%. The North America division closer to third great quarter of organic sales growth with organic sales growth of 2% driven by a combination of volume and pricing growth. In the United States, our positive pricing was driven by our oral care business, led by toothpaste and manual tooth brushes. Our market shares are flat or up in 8 of our 12 categories in the United States with strong gains in manual tooth brushes, liquid hand soap and cleaners. In Q2 we continue maintaining leadership in the market, although our share is down year-over-year as we have seen aggressive couponing in the category. Latin America had a difficult Q2 as we saw a negative impact from the Brazilian trucker strike and weakness in Latin American currency versus the U.S. dollar in the quarter. Latin America net sales declined 7% in the quarter as volumes down 1%, pricing is down 0.5% and foreign exchange was negative 5.5%. We estimate that excluding the impact of the Brazilian trucker strike our volume would have been up low single digit to the division. As we discussed at an investor conference in June, our market share performance in Latin America remains very strong. Year-to-date our value shares are up in six of nine categories in Latin America including all three oral care categories. In Brazil, our shares are up year-to-date in five of six categories including the 70 basis points increase in toothpaste market share driven by Colgate Total visible health. Our market share performance was more mixed in Mexico, where we continue to see higher levels of promotional activity particularly in toothpaste, bar soap and dish soap. The key issue in Latin America remains the lower levels of inflation in our categories, we are optimistic that the combination of raw material inflation in recent weakness in Latin American currencies versus the dollar should lead to a more favorable pricing environment. Moving to Europe, net sales in Europe grew 6% in Q2 while organic sales declined 1%. Volume growth of 2.5% was offset by slightly negative 3.5%. Our oral care market shares continue to improve in Europe with our toothpaste share up year-to-date in the division particularly in France where our market share continues to rebound. Moving to Asia Pacific, net sales in Asia Pacific were up 1.5% in the quarter with foreign exchange driving the growth as organic sales were flat. Oral care organic sales were positive offset by a decline in personal care. Asia Pacific pricing improves sequentially and was up year-over-year as we look to drive pricing growth to offset raw material costs inflation. Our volume growth was impacted by our pricing actions, particularly in Greater China, where we expect that impact to moderate in the second half of the year. Our e-commerce business in China continues to grow at a rapid pace and gain market shares driven by our continued efforts to preimmunize our portfolio.  We saw sales growth in India in the quarter with a combination of both pricing and volume growth behind the line of the Shakti Ayurvedic toothpaste and the benefit of easier comparison from the implementation of the goods and services tax in Q2. The Africa Eurasia division reported net sales growth of 1% in Q2 as solid organic sales growth was partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange driven by weakness in the Russian ruble and the Turkish lira.  Encouragingly, we saw volume growth of 2%, Our first quarter volume growth in the division since Q1 2015. With a volume growth across every hub. Pricing remain positive at plus 1%. Last quarter, we mentioned the launch of our 12-gram sachet in Africa as part of our program to drive household penetration and per capita consumption in an emerging market. This quarter, we will add a 3-gram sachet in Sub-Saharan Africa. And we\u2019ll finish up with Hill's,  Hill's delivered 3.5% net sales growth in the second quarter, volume growth of 1% was led by the United States while pricing was up 1%. On Science Diet, we\u2019ve seen market share gains in the specialty chain on the U.S. as we benefit from the movement of several specialty brands into mass gen. Now, we\u2019ll turn to our updated outlook for 2018. As stated in our press release, we now expect net sales to increase low single-digits in 2018 as we incorporate the recent strengthening of the dollar. We still expect organic sales to be up low-single-digits with growth in the second half above that in the first half.  Our second half plan does not include any recouped volumes from the Brazil trucker strike as it remains to be seen whether this volume will return in the second half or if the trade will look to keep inventories at this current lower level. On a GAAP basis, we expect gross margin to be flat year-over-year in 2018. Excluding the impact of our global growth and efficiency program, we expect gross margin to be down modestly. The continued increase in raw material costs, including the impact of transaction of foreign exchange is the primary driver of our revised gross margin guidance.  We continue to expect that advertising will be up year-over-year on an absolute basis and at the percentage of sales to the full year versus 2017 driven by a year-over-year increase in the second half. Both on a GAAP basis and included in the impact of our global growth and efficiency program and the benefit from the foreign tax matter we still expect our tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27% in 2018 but we now view the bottom of the range as more likely. We expect the GAAP earnings per share to be up double-digits for the year excluding charges related to the global growth and efficiency program the one-time provisional charge resulting from U.S. tax reform in 2017 and the benefits from the foreign tax matter in 2018. We now expect earnings per share growth to be in the mid-single-digits again incorporating recent moves in foreign exchange. And with that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Operator : Today\u2019s question and answer session will be conducted electronically for the telephone audience. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning. Ian Cook : Morning, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So, it\u2019s helpful to hear about the sense of urgency, but I think many of the points you made today on e-commerce innovation et cetera have been in place for a while. I guess it sounded like the biggest changes may be less pricing in the back half and originally expected but it doesn\u2019t feel like any of these points are radical changes that would necessarily result in a material improvement in market share organic sales growth.  So, just at a very high level as you think about managing the business, have you thought about more drastic actions here to drive a reinvigoration perhaps lowering pricing in some areas not just moderate increases, but making bigger adjustments so investing a lot more behind the business in some of the areas you mentioned so Philips on those two specific areas would be helpful or any other areas perhaps that are missing that you might have pondered here? Ian Cook : Yeah, I guess Dara I obviously don\u2019t convey urgency well. And yes, we have been talking about naturals as one of our innovation areas for a while I think what I was trying to demonstrate is that our urgency is not only to get established where it is and where it is it has been doing quite well as I said from a share point of view and from a repeat point of view importantly but we are accelerating the expansion of that line of products around the world and have organized ourselves so that our speed of implementation across all geography is now accelerated in other words more urgent. And when I say things like a sharp and focus on discounters and pharmacy I mean a sharp and focused clearly these were environments we always did business in, but we have increased our strategic focus on them, because we think they can and will give us incremental growth. And of course, e-commerce, yes has been around for a long time. But we are challenging ourselves on how we can really make sure that our e-commerce growth is faster than the growth of the category, so we build market share which implies new techniques hence Hubble, hence taking products in our portfolio and selling through marketplaces in China direct on e-commerce which were things we had not done before and indeed transfer elmex to pharmacy in Brazil is a new initiative with the urgency. Now, behind all of that, we have adjusted a lot of our marketing programs. Let me use China perhaps as an example. You know that our market share in China on a value basis has been under pressure and the primary reason for that has been the explosive growth of the super-premium segment in that marketplace. So, what our volume share was holding up relatively well, our value share was penalized by a mix in our portfolio that didn't address the shape of the market. Now, we've approached that in two ways. One way, we have talked about is the dare to love toothpaste that was created in five months to be introduced locally at a super-premium price. The second is the Naturals line of products that we have moved within China also at a super-premium price. And as I just mentioned today now, elmex coming in at a super-premium price. So direct to consumer through the important as you know, particularly in China e-commerce market. But we also in China through a very strong relaunch of the biggest business we have in China in toothpaste took a very bold price move supported by the question you're here to relaunch to tear up the pricing of our largest business in that marketplace. That pricing is now established. It is at the shelf in retail, it changes the mix of our portfolio in China favorably towards more premiums and now we can drive not just the new innovation, but we can drive our largest business at a different price point which will give a top-line benefit of course, and a value market share benefit. So, all of those things have been put together within the last year and I think going forward change the shape of our portfolio in China. Investment wise, we believe that the investment level, we have maintained for this year is strong and appropriate. We are flat at the half year-on-year maintaining at a good level and expect to be up for the balance of the year given our shape of innovation around the world. And as we continue to advance our plans, we will of course, decide which opportunities we believe at most potential and structure our investment behind them to make sure we get the maximum trial of the innovation we bring to market. We are generally seeing improved quality of communication vehicle both digitally and on the traditional media. So, we're very happy with the engagement vehicles, we have behind our business. So, urgency, yes. Panic, no. Finding the right balance in conveying this is obviously difficult at this time, but we are being dramatic and reevaluating as the small example I gave all aspects of our business as we move forward here. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hey guys. I think just pulling some of the threads together from your prepared remarks, you answered just now. To me overarching maybe longer-term maybe shorter-term question is if and when do you guys need to really do a rebase of margins and earnings.  Your top-line continues to decelerate further, you don't need to compare market shares as best as we can tell down over 150 basis points again this quarter. Globally, it doesn't seem at least for the first half of this year, you found anything worth increasing the advertising spend on. And I guess cadences, but you don't feel like that's an increased advertising spend with those results. Gross margin at this sloppy [ph] level seems to be a struggle. I mean each of the reason that seems like are spending more overhead. And you mentioned surely great places you have to invest in right to be fair like skin and health like commerce, like naturals, like sharper focus on some of the brick and mortar retailers. So, do you think that the company put off when it has been overearning, and these are rebates here. And perhaps if you know what does your new COO know well as think about our rebase as well? Ian Cook : Well, thanks Ali. I must say the way you paint your question of course leads to a certain conclusion at a point in time. I trying to take them in turn. I think I answered the way we are thinking about innovation and growth going forward.  And we feel confident that the innovation profile and portfolio we have going forward is compelling and we will invest behind it. The clearly in terms of gross margin right now the overwhelming impact and which came very sharply was both in commodity costs and in foreign exchange and the transaction impact of that on those commodity costs.  And as I said, we are going to have to price in addition to our strong product inventory programs to see that gross margin recover. Much of the pricing is already announced and out there. And our ability to effectively price in the marketplace I think has been demonstrated already and will hold up in a more inflationary environment going forward. And you know well in some parts of the world, we have had to react to intend promotional activity which we have not judged was rational, but we have reacted to and in the U.S. where our share has been under pressure, the share of course has popped back up as we have met the couponing pressure out there in the marketplace. So, we think the spending is appropriate. We think the innovation is sound. And we think we selective M&A that we have made, and which of course remains an aspect of our strategy has been wise and have added value. And where we to do more we believe they will continue to add value as part of our portfolio. So, I would not say overearning, and I would say that we have been very focused on meeting these challenges, as they have risen, and we have been putting in place a very close strategy to meet them in the marketplace geography by geography around the world.  Now, as to know, John [ph] became the president quite recently, as that, of course is part of the longstanding succession process that we would have been running perhaps with the last decade and like all of the senior leaders in Colgate now already has a strong voice in shaping our action for this year and in the - for 2019 and we will develop a plan, we believe will drive the topline with quality innovation and we will spend what we need to spend to get full return on that innovation in the best interest of the company and all stakeholders for the long-term. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : Great Thank You. Good morning. To build on your pricing comments, I'm assuming one pocket of improvement will be the increase pricing that you expect to get in Latin America. I really want to understand the confidence there because the lack of pricing year-to-date in that market, the negative pricing in the quarter really stands out, not just against your history, but against what we\u2019ve heard from peers this season. I know the country and category mix is different, but Coke and Pepsi saw very robust pricing in Latin America for example, Kimberly Clark and Unilever, they\u2019ve arguably struggled more similar to you, realized price, but each of them at least called out sequential improvement Q1 to Q2, whereas your pricing seems going in another way.  So, I guess, why do you think you\u2019ve been different, what gives you the confidence that things get better from here and I know you mention rising input cost in the worsening effects that those should help, but I guess my question there is that really a good thing, because I'm assuming in dollar terms your outlook is still lower. So, it\u2019s not pricing in real terms, as I see it, but maybe you can steer me a different direction there. So, just comments on Latin American pricing would be great. Thanks. Ian Cook : In terms of pricing in Latin America, our brands so high have very good pricing power. You remember, the story last year, where we took very, very significant pricing in the first half which eased off in the back half of the year. So, we're up against a very strong product year comparison and the Latin American pricing was I mean essentially flat. That said, the foreign exchange pressure that is clearly there requires offsetting from a gross margin point of view and for the key Latin American markets pricing has already been announced and is making its way to the marketplace.  So, I don\u2019t think we will need any resistance in taking the pricing in Latin America and we\u2019ve a very strong innovation plan. So, I think the year-on-year comparison is telling as a competitive activity, I recall mentioning on the last quarterly call in Mexico which we have now begun to meet to a certain extent. But that said, the pricing in Latin America is announced, is in the plan and it is moving to the marketplace. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Nik Modi with RBC. Nik Modi : Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping, you can just provide some perspective around competition and specifically, what Glaxo is doing in the sensitive toothpaste market and then the local competitors in the emerging markets maybe you can call out areas where, there is some catch up be done whether it will be a local innovation or insights. And then on P&G in terms of what you\u2019re seeing from them in the marketplace right now, as we\u2019ve been hearing, they've been pretty aggressive, pretty broadly in oral care. Ian Cook : Well, thanks Nick and first of all I think it would be fair to say as we categorize the first quarter the comparative environment from several quarters but certainly a couple of the companies you mentioned in your question have been quite elevated and I mentioned on the last quarter that in some cases we did not judge the activity to be sustainable or sensible and we did not mentioned in other cases to defend their market shares, we have reacted in order to meet that competitive activity and of course that has a predictably immediate effect on recovery in our market share. So, it is our objective to remain rational in this space and prefer to drive growth in the company through innovation and marketing rather than short term unsustainable promotional activity, but we will need what we have to meet. In terms of the local brands the topics are the ones that we have discussed before largely China and India and - in China it would take all of the court and list all of the local brands in China there are a couple of important players. And we choose sponsors in China that I think I described in quite a bit of detail is the process of the premium segment which we had reacted to in the manner I outlined before and an acceleration of this naturals innovation done differently in China than in India.  In India, I will say that the - product that we have introduced is growing quite nicely, we believe it is an adequate foil to the local brand there as I repeat as I mentioned is at a very strong level. And the market shares are moving up on an ongoing basis indeed in the modern side share is already up beyond 3 percentage points. so, we know the product will be affective in the market place and we will remain commitment to put advertising behind it. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey good morning folks. Thank you for allowing me to ask some questions. Ian Cook : Hi, Jason. How do you feel? Jason English : I guess I'm going to pivot off of sort of market competitive dynamics instead ask a question on margins, you resort a lot of cost pressure this quarter, the 320 basis points drag on GMs sharp uptick from the first quarter. Two questions on that. First, what drove such a meaningful acceleration in your weight of inflation from the first quarter to the second quarter, it doesn\u2019t really seem can grow kind of what we see in the spot market out there? And second there is always this rather strange and not quite intuitive cadence or seasonality to your inflation rate where every year it seems to build through the fourth quarter drop off in the first quarter then once again ramp beyond. Should we expect that same ramp this year in other words should we expect inflation drag to get even bigger as we progress through the remainder of the year? Ian Cook : Yeah, good questions Jason and obviously areas we spend a lot of time focusing on as we construct our activity for the balance of the year and thinking about it in terms of setting up 2019.  It really is as simple as a very sharp run up in commodity costs both on the first quarter and on the second quarter of the previous year and the effect of the very sharp run up in the U.S. dollar and therefore foreign exchange negative for us in the transaction costs of those raw materials and based on things about effectively drive the gross margin. Now, let me just take a little bit longer to describe the composition of the second quarter. So, if you go back to the second quarter of last year, our ad gross margin was at 16.7%. As you know, pricing gave nothing to gross margin in this quarter. Funding the growth up 170 basis points was a good start in line with last year as you know our curve tends to build across the year in terms of our funding the growth and then as I said in my prepared remarks and you just echoed the material prices hit us by 320, 10 bps of other and that takes you to the current year gross profit. So, that\u2019s the swing and I can sort of dimensionalize it even understanding that oil takes time to work its way through the system. But if you take the price of Brent first quarter of last year, first quarter of this year it was up 23%. If you take the second quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year it was 47%, a 12% sequential increase quarter-on-quarter. And it's not similar pace of change that created the impact. Now, our current plan effectively sees that level of impact continuing for the balance of the year. So, we don\u2019t expect that current stock rates and with what we know about commodity prices, that curve will continue to lie obviously our funding the growth curve does continue to rise as the year unfolds and as we said there will be a benefit from modest movements in pricing which allow us to build a plan that sees gross margin begin to recover across the back half of the year. But I wouldn\u2019t\u2019 say there is a little predictable cycle which seem to come all the time usually for us the impact on gross margin is all about commodity price move and foreign exchange move and as you know the foreign exchange move is instant. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, everyone. So, good morning. I have the\u2026 Ian Cook : Good morning Andrea. Andrea Teixeira : Good morning. Clarification and also one specific question. So, no the clarification about just reinvesting the business and the funding for growth. So, have you delayed some of the discretionary spending given the headwinds and commodities and price increase which I believe it was more massive than anyone anticipated. So, I know you kept outlook of local market investments above sales, but I was just wondering if how we should think through the balance of the year and that could actually be a way for you to reach that mid-single-digit EPS guidance. And on the specific question, if you can elaborate on the competitive dynamics and destocking Mexico. I understand that in most of the destocking is probably lapping that from the third quarter for last year and you said in the pricing announcements which I was a bit confused were implemented in the third quarter, so we\u2019re implemented in Mexico now, but you are facing a tough comp from last year when you also implemented a price increase that do not fix. So, what makes you confident that this time you're going to have the pricing seeking this time around. Thank you. Ian Cook : Thanks, Andrea. Delayed discretionary spending and you've talked above the line. So, few things to say I guess, you probably saw that our SG&A was down year-on-year. And the SG&A was down notwithstanding as John said an impact of increased logistics costs which we carry on overhead. That means that our overhead ratio was down meaningfully year-on-year. and that traces to the global growth and efficiency program that we have had which you're seeing as through the hobbling and business services and some discrete activity change the shape of our organization and reduce overhead cost. So, in that sense, we have been very focused and quite urgent about making sure we get the benefit of that to run through overhead and run through the SG&A. Therefore, in terms of discretionary, yes, we are being very cautious on discretionary income, discretionary spend. In terms of the above line, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this idea of revenue growth management which includes everything from taking risk price increase on the face of the invoice to negotiating ultimate promotional activity in partnership with the retailers in a way that is more efficient and yet as productive for both of us. So that's that is yes, an area of focus for us, but nothing unusual. I mean to this point about are we not doing things that we think are important to do for the ongoing development of the company absolutely not. So, where we think it's appropriate to invest we are. I would say on Mexico, that the destocking will be behind this at the end of this quarter. The issue in Mexico had more to do with stepped up competitive activity, which we did not need instantly, because we didn't think it was rationale but to some extent we have now adjusted our plans to meet.  And the pricing in Mexico is announced that moving to the marketplace as we work our way through the third quarter. In the context of foreign exchange, it is quite traceable to cost impact but because of the transaction impact. And we feel that compared to the peak increases of the first quarter and second quarter last year overall as a lesser level. And we think we'll stick in the marketplace given the inflationary pressures now resurging across Latin America including Mexico. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Good morning. Ian Cook : Good morning, Bonnie. Bonnie Herzog : Good morning. I just had a quick question on pricing. You mentioned you've already put it in place in several markets. So curious to hear what you're seeing so far in terms of the impact on your volumes or possible downtrading within your categories especially relative to past increases. And then there has been a lot of discussion about stepped up private label penetration from some of your peers. So just curious to hear how much of a risk do you think there might be from retailers stepping up investments in private label across your categories if any. Thanks. Ian Cook : Yeah, in many cases Bonnie with the new pricing, they are announced and moving to the shelf. So, I don't yet have historical data to tell you about the impact on volume. I will make the point as I said in my prepared remarks that the pricing we are taking in the second half of the year of meaningful to the structure of our plan is not significant in the absolute. Our experience in Latin America is that there is usually a short-term volume impact as much in the retail equation as with the consumer. And I don't see why this time would be any different. If we turn to private label pleasingly given the nature of our categories at least all pets and personal care given the emotional engagement, those categories have with consumers given that, particularly with a toothpaste, if you're going to put something in your mouth or your kid's mouth, if you want to trust that brand. We have seen private label development around the world, probably most developed in Europe, but still low single-digits negligible in the United States, and in the emerging markets almost a nonexistent because our consumers have serious doubts about quality of certain products in those marketplaces. So, we're very attentive to it. We track it all the time. But so far, given the emotional connection with the product category and our brand in that category. It has not been a significant factor. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. Good morning. Ian Cook : Hi, Kevin. Kevin Grundy : Good morning. First, a cleanup question on category growth rates. Can you just provide the EM, DM and overall category growth rates relative to the half a point of organic sales growth in the quarter?  And then the larger question is just sort of your level of confidence on this strategy. And specifically, the three key factors you touched on Ian to start the call and your level of visibility and sort of the tangible glide path in terms of when Colgate can return to the 3% to 5% organic sales growth. Do you feel comfortable with the low-end of that range looking to the back half of this year? Is that something you feel comfortable looking at the next year? So, any commentary there would be helpful and then just one last piece and if just to summarize the earlier response, because I think it's important. It sounds like you believe, you can get back to improve levels of growth with current investment level. So that is in the absence of the, sort of proverbial earnings rebases. I just wanted to make sure, I heard that right. Because I think it's important. So, thank you for those. Ian Cook : Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Kevin. Well, if I look at the category growth rates, I would say that the U.S. continues to grow around 2%, which is, well your full year compare to some not so distant history.  The European environment continues to be very tempted, overall between zero to one. Latin America had slowed, because of that lower inflation. So, the rates which have been the mid-single-digits sell off to low-single-digits.  We expect those to come back, the volume is there we expect those to come back with the pricing in the second half, which we expect to see across the markets. And Asia, Africa, you would say in the mid-single-digit perhaps 4% there. So those are the categories. Now, in terms of the strategy and what I mentioned this morning. I mentioned some stuff this morning. The stuff I mentioned this morning were areas that we wanted to emphasize on this call. Those three areas don't embody, the company's strategy overall.  And so, we revisit this all the time and you can rest assured that one of the key areas of revisiting has been and we'll continue to be on a regular basis what we are doing to accelerate growth. And that involves all of the senior leadership in the company. And every time we do it that leads with the sense of urgency that we have that leads to specific actions that we start to deploy immediately. And I think to this point even though we have made quite a lot of changes within the confines of the overall strategy we have. We are confident and driving towards returning to that 3% to 5% growth rate.  I think that for this year, we guided the organic growth for a balance of the year and the full year low-single digits. That will see a step up from the first quarter, but I would not state that the organic growth will be 3% for the third quarter. I think we will be looking at our 2019 plan to return solidly there for that year with the innovation we see in the plans that we will put behind the business. Now in terms of that improved growth. That improved growth is the strategy we are deploying. Increased investment will be there in the second half of this year. And as I said earlier, we will do what is right to support the growth ambitions we have in 2019 consistent with that strategy reflecting the quality of innovation and marketing programs we believe we have.  And with the balance of responsibility to all stakeholders in the company in terms of what the shape of that ultimately looks like. But you're right I was not implying that this company is actively thinking of a so called rebase. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Steve Strikhalo [ph] with UBS. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good afternoon. Quick question on to dig into Jason English's question on the gross margin piece a little bit more. Ian how should we think about the down modestly for the year given this trajectory of commodities. Just thinking about the third and fourth quarter and rising inflation it feels like it 50 basis points down year-over-year a modest range. And can you kind of unpack how much transactional was await to the gross margin degradation in 2Q. Thank you. Ian Cook : Yeah, so to answer the second point. Transaction cost in the second quarter was about 50 basis points of that 320. And I think I mentioned in response to an earlier question that the overall impact of material costs both commodity and transaction we expect to run at around the same level as the second quarter of this year.  So, we framed - what we framed purposefully. What that requires with the run-down I gave earlier on the second quarter and the additional contribution of pricing in the third and fourth, it assumes a build back an increase of gross margin across the second half of the year. And frankly I would modestly at modestly. And I guess I would leave it there? Operator : And we'll take our next question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Thanks. Wanted to focus more on the ... Ian Cook : Olivia sorry., I'm not picking you very clearly. Olivia Tong : Can you hear me now? Ian Cook : Yeah, I can, yes. Olivia Tong : Well, perfect. Ian Cook : Yeah, can you hear me? It sounds like an ad. Olivia Tong : I want to focus a little bit on the non-Colgate oral care brands as you start putting a little bit more focus on that part of the portfolio elmex for example. How does your approach changed because the product is different, some of the retailers are different but is the customer different and how do you change your marketing strategies accordingly and do your existing retailers that carry the Colgate brand would they be interested in that as well and does the potentially presents an opportunity for you? Ian Cook : Well, I think you capture a very important point Olivia. We have since the years of acquisition actually expanded elmex to several important European markets given its premium nature we have usually saw season in pharmacy because that is part of the business sold of the development of the brand.  And then ultimately move into broader retailer distribution without damaging the pricing strategy integrity called the business and I would say based on our European experience that our retailer partners be the pharmacy or broader market place are very attracted by an additional brand in the Colgate portfolio knowing the quality of that product alongside Colgate and in fact it\u2019s targeted at different uses, so it\u2019s incremental for us and incremental for them. Now in the markets I mentioned we are starting in China direct to consumer from an e-commerce point of view and in Brazil to pharmacy which is a very important category of retailer segment for high end therapeutic products and that\u2019s where we will start always with elmex. But I think if the European experience plays out the same way in these markets you put indeed expect overtime us to broaden the aperture of sales for elmex and I think we would get the same support and positive result that we have seen in Europe. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Caroline Levy [ph] with Macquarie. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Good afternoon. I know it\u2019s run very longer just very quickly inventory destocking on a global basis Ian could you just touch on whether you think this remains a significant risk that as retailers margins are under pressure we\u2019re really going to see this wave hit the U.S. and other markets as well more substantially do you think it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to be talking about a lot of in the next few years and if there are any markets where it has had a substantial impact already? Ian Cook : Yeah, so we have talked before about inventory destocking impacts in various market places I guess most especially in Mexico and China and there is always going to be at the edges a rebalancing of inventory as the mix of retail environments shift particularly where e-commerce is a factor.  But I would say going forward, this is likely to be a more of an emerging market issue why, because another distribution in those markets is indirect distribution and you are reaching customers through distributors and wholesalers and when they get shy of events they see in the market place they tend to stop buying in the moment and wait until they see signs or they recovery in whatever trade sector they service. But to your implication that could we see this coming to North America I think when we track our inventory levels with our major customers in North America honestly, we have seen a general decline in inventory levels held by the more sophisticated customers down into the most single lease and if you went back a decade it would have been double-digit weeks. And I think with all of the technology available to us today with the simplification of portfolios and efficiency in supply chain some of the levels we now add in the U.S. with the most sophisticated customers, I would say a baseline operating level.  So, a significant piece of volatility in that regard, I think is unlikely, I think, both parties will be working to find efficiency, but, I think, it will be a continual gradual progress. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Thank you. Ian, I was just curious about them the longer-range things that you mentioned. Because I think the dynamics and the things you\u2019re doing in the short-term and medium-term to improve results, whether its pricing or broadening distribution, e-commerce. These will just, we\u2019ll have to see play out, but I was really intrigue by both the mention of committed health and also still the professional skin acquisition, as you know it is not news today.  It's different for I think Colgate to be exploring two vectors that are arguably really quite new, right and it would be let alone one. But to be looking into kind of two areas that are a bit, a step away from the core.  So, can you just talk about that, I mean, I guess capabilities from a corporate standpoint to be exploring new avenues and really how aggressively you're going to go after these things, would be one.  And then two, what you read into or not at all about your views on kind of the growth potential of the core business. There is different perspective on what the growth can look like with what your current footprint outside of these two areas that you mentioned? Ian Cook : Okay, Lauren, Thank you. The answer of those connected health and skin traced to strategy and we think that they are important place for the future. From a personnel cap point of view, we have laid our territory, where we want to establish and build a position in skin health, true skin health. And that requires determologist, requires a portfolio that the professionals in that space will recommend and if there is opportunity to build organically with the two assets we have today and as I implied earlier, it is also a nice platform upon which we can build, should we say choose other assets externally as that would shift that generalized strategy of skin health.  Interestingly, some of the thinking we have on our base business around recommendation and endorsement, translating and apply very, very well. We obviously learned a new areas of skin applications and skin science which we can trickle down to our base businesses like Sanex and Palmolive, but we can also now move up in terms of clinically demonstrable healthcare delivery.  We think that\u2019s a good space, that we think that with population trends in the world is a long-term growth space with pricing advantage and margin advantage for the long-term and once people used these products like the suntan lotion from Elta for a particular skin condition to protect them from the sun, I hate to use the word for skin care product, but little over stick ability, because people will stay with the product that gives them the benefit they are looking for. And the connected brush, what we see and have seen for a while is that the combination of behavior and data can be a powerful way to build the businesses going forward. And, if you think about where data is going, the ubiquity of it, the miniaturization of it. The depths of what it can provide as AI starts to play a role.  The toothbrush is a wonderful vehicle to be an informed advisor to a person using that product. And never mind, if you can translate that same benefit in emerging parts of the word to a manual offering for example. And so, we think, this is the step into the future. We think it will take time to build. We think the capability we can bring from an information point of view to consumer will grow. We think Apple is a terrific partner in terms of the technical reputation that it brings to the buying consumers and so happens with the colors are in the [indiscernible] colors which is good red and white. So, a scenario we are committed to and we see as building. I think in terms of the core business, we continue to believe there is vitality in the categories in the categories in which we do business. one of the structural changes we have embarked upon which revenue growth management talk to the specific action in China talked to in terms of clearing up the business, recent there is rich opportunity to take our big businesses and in addition to the new product innovation bring meaningfully signed typically supported innovation to our bigger businesses with the corresponding value increase both perceived and asked to a consumer and with that can grow the top-line of our base sustainably into the future. So, there is all the questions we have today, I thank everybody for participating on the call and we look forward to catching up with you later in the year. Bye-bye. Operator : And that does conclude today\u2019s conference, thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John. John Faucher : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Henning Jakobsen, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Ian Cook : Good morning, everyone. This is Ian, and I\u2019d like to make some introductory comments. You will recall from our previous quarterly earnings call that we talked in some depth and with some urgency around our focus on innovation and building growth in channels where people are shopping, and our commitment to advertising and continuing to derive efficiency and capabilities. And I do not intend today to dwell on those areas. What I intend to focus on is what was a challenging and disappointing quarter for us. Challenging on two levels. First, foreign exchange, which moved sharply negative, particularly so in our large Latin American division; and secondly, the underlying growth in commodity costs, partly affected by the transaction impact of foreign exchange. Underlying materials were up over 8%; oil, as you know, was up 46% quarter-on-quarter. And as you will hear from John, who will go forward, our margin roll forward, raw and packing materials this quarter were 390 basis points negative impact against gross margin. And from both material and foreign exchange points of view, we expect that pressure to continue in the fourth quarter. And that is why, we took the pricing that we did in the third, which we spoke to about in the second quarter, and pricing will continue to be an area of necessary focus going forward, as you have heard from some of our competitors quite recently. The disappointing part of this earnings report is the weak top-line, for 6 divisions up, but with Brazil in Latin America and China in Asia drove our top-line from positive to negative. So, let me start with Brazil. In Brazil, the macroeconomics are volatile, including a hangover from the trucker strike in the second quarter. And of course, less now, but still uncertainty around the elections. The categories, as you\u2019ve heard from others, in our principal businesses, turned negative in the third quarter, both in volume and in value. We took pricing early as we said we would, and we have not yet seen retail pricing move up or competitors for our pricing lead. And as you know and as you have heard from others as well, in situations like this, often there is a gap between the lead and moving price and competitors following. We have obviously therefore seen a volume impact negatively because of the pricing we took. And we reported, you may recall, less of a negative impact from the trucker strike in the second quarter than our competitors, and that may also have affected our third quarter performance a little bit as well. Our market shares continue to hold in well, up year-to-date and holding through our leading pricing action. And our plans going forward remain the same. We are sticking with our commitment to pricing. And we do expect inflation to return to the categories. We\u2019re launching the premium new products that we said we would, in the pharmacy channel, OrthoGard and PerioGard off to a good start; elmex just starting to ship right now. And Naturals in toothpaste and Personal Care moving to the marketplace. And of course, as we announced at Barclays and this applies globally, we have the relaunch of our scale core Total business beginning worldwide in the first quarter and for Brazil particularly where this is a 17 share business, it will have a favorable impact on growth going forward. We, I must say, take on Brazil, a more guarded view than we have heard from others given the situation we see in our categories. But, if I would offer a glimmer of light, it is fair to say when we look at our category data, accessing the third quarter, the declines we saw were easing, which hopefully augurs well as we go forward. China is a different set of circumstances. We remain positive on China. There is growth in the category, and our volume share of 34% has held constant over a good number of years. Our value share, slightly lower, represents the area of opportunity as we have spoken about, because there are two big things going on in China. Number one is the premiumization of categories, led by some of the local brands that we have spoken about; and the second is a very big change in consumption patterns and shopping environment with the explosion of e-commerce in the country. Now, to respond to the premiumization of the category, as we have spoken about before, we have brought a premium price Naturals offering to the marketplace. We have done online initiatives like the Dare To Love toothpaste that did so well last year and will be repeated in 11/11 and 12/12 again this year. elmex, also moving online along with electric toothbrushes and a whitening -- in-home whitening offering for the country all at a premium price offering. But, as we told you in the second quarter, we have also taken meaningful pricing on over half of our business on both the Darlie brand and the Colgate brand. Given that with the premiumization of the category in addition to extending our portfolio into premium, we need to move our prices up from mid tier to the more premium tier. And in doing so, it impacted our volume. Now, we\u2019re beginning to see that pricing move through in the direct trade where it is already impacting our consumption, which is up. But, it yet has to move through the indirect trade, which is complicated by the change in consumption patterns in the Company -- in the country as I mentioned to you earlier. And we are working down inventory to realize that change through the longtail distribution network over time. That is not going to be fixed immediately, but it should get better from here. Now, to come back to the areas we have been focusing on and the rest of our businesses. We do believe the areas that we have focused on are underpinning our consistent growth now in North America, notwithstanding some of the promotional pressures we have seen and you have seen on toothpaste in that country. Hill\u2019s is rebounding nicely from the troubles we had in prior year. And indeed that growth is led by a strong U.S. business. Europe is continuing to grow quite nicely in a low growth environment. Africa/Eurasia now, having overcome our distributor problems, growing from multiple quarters, and India is seeing a slow volume and pricing, and our share performance beginning to improve behind the innovation and the advertising support. And we do believe that consistent focus on advertising and innovation is underpinning those performances and will continue into the future. We are, again, I repeat focused on pricing going forward. And we do see pricing improving, even though we have perhaps begun slightly ahead of our competitors, we see that continuing going forward. And again, as we announced at Barclays, and this will be a big impact for the world, we will have that relaunch of our scale Total business starting in the first quarter of 2019. So, those are the comments I wanted to make specific to Brazil and China, but also on the rest of our business. And I\u2019ll now turn it back to John. John Faucher : Thanks, Ian. Our net sales declined 3% in Q3 as flat volume and 1% favorable pricing were offset by 4% negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the benefit from our recently acquired professional skincare businesses EltaMD and PCA Skin, volume was down 1.5%, driven by the issues in China and Brazil that Ian discussed. On a GAAP basis, our gross profit margin was down 100 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, it was down 120 basis points year-over-year. For the quarter, our 100 basis points of pricing provided a 50 basis-point benefit to gross margin. Raw material costs including the impact of foreign exchange transaction costs were 390 basis-point drag on gross margin year-over-year. Our productivity program, led by our funding-the-growth initiative, provided a 220 basis-point benefits to gross margin, while there was no impact from other in the quarter. On an absolute basis, advertising investment was down year-over-year in Q3, driven by foreign exchange. On a percentage to sales basis, advertising was up 10 basis points year-over-year. Despite the challenges we faced in certain markets, we continue to invest in advertising our brands to drive brand equity and to build awareness to drive trial for our innovation. Excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, the remainder of our SG&A expenses were down year-over-year in Q3 on an absolute basis, but up as a percent of sales. Excluding the headwind from increased freight, logistics and warehousing costs, our overhead expenses were down in the quarter on an absolute basis and as a percent of sales as we continue to see benefits from a productivity program. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share of $0.60 were down 12% year-over-year in Q3. Excluding charges resulting from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program and a provisional charge related to U.S. Tax Reform, diluted earnings per share were down 1% at $0.72 as we benefited from a lower tax rate. Now, I\u2019ll take a quick run through the divisions. We\u2019ll start off with North America. Net sales in North America increased 8% in the quarter with our recent professional skincare acquisitions contributing 6%. The North America division posted its fourth straight quarter of organic sales growth with organic sales growth of 2% as we continue to see a nice combination of volume and pricing growth. We saw continued strength in unmeasured channels like e-commerce and club stores. Year-to-date, our market shares are flat or up in 8 of our 12 categories in the United States with strong gains in manual toothbrushes, liquid hand soap and cleaners. The toothpaste category in the United States continues to see high levels of promotion, particularly through electric couponing, although we have maintained market leadership. As Ian discussed last quarter, we have made adjustments to our promotional plans in reaction to what we are seeing in the marketplace. Latin America had a difficult Q3, driven by a combination of foreign exchange headwinds and category declines in Brazil. Latin American net sales declined 13% in the quarter as volume was down 6%, pricing was up 2.5% and foreign exchange was negative 9.5%. Our pricing improved in the quarter as we look to offset continued raw materials inflation, as well as the impact of transactional foreign exchange, given recent weakness in currencies like the Brazilian reals and the Argentinean peso. Outside of Argentina, we generally have not seen similar pricing moves from some of our competitors. We will remain disciplined and rational in regards to pricing as we expect inflation to accelerate going forward. We delivered both volume and pricing growth in Mexico in the third quarter. Although, we continue to see heightened levels of promotion in several categories, particularly bar soap, dish soap and toothpaste. Moving to Europe. Net sales in Europe were down 0.5% in Q3. Organic sales were up 0.5% with positive volume growth, partially offset by negative pricing. Foreign exchange was minus 1% for the quarter. The UK posted strong volume growth in the quarter, which led to market share gains in Q3. We are particularly pleased with the performance of our premium business in the UK as Colgate Total and Colgate Max White toothpaste continue to gain share. Our UK business should be further bolstered by the continued rollout of our Colgate Natural Extracts toothpaste line, including our latest offering of Charcoal plus White. Sanex continues to grow market share in the body wash category behind the Sanex Zero percent line as well as the Sanex physiologic line, which is bringing high-end premium priced pharma trends into the mass channel in what continues to be a difficult pricing environment in Europe. Moving to Asia Pacific. Net sales in Asia Pacific were down 7.5% in the quarter, driven by volume declines and foreign exchange pipelines. As been discussed, inventory reductions in China was a biggest contributor to the weak performance. We continue to be encouraged by the improvement in performance of our India business. We continue to deliver volume growth with positive pricing despite high levels of competitive activity. We are encouraged with the market share performance of our Swarna and Cibaca Vedshakti toothpaste lines. As we see further distribution gains and continue to invest in advertising, we expect our share in the Ayurvedic segment of the toothpaste category to continue to grow. We also launched a new herbal offering in Thailand this quarter, Colgate Naturals Panjaved, further expanding our portfolio in that country in the higher price Naturals segment. In Africa/Eurasia, positive pricing growth in Q3 was partially offset by slightly negative volume growth. Net sales in the Africa/Eurasia division decreased 6%, primarily due to a high-single-digit negative impact from foreign exchange, driven by weakness in the Russian ruble in Turkish lira. We took additional pricing in the quarter to help offset raw material inflation and foreign exchange transaction costs. We continue to be encouraged by the return to growth of our Sub-Saharan Africa business, which continues to improve following the distributor issues we dealt with in late 2016 and 2017. Year-to-date, our toothpaste share is flat or up in 13 of 18 markets. And we are particularly pleased with our share performance in Turkey where the Colgate brand is closing in on the market leader. And we\u2019ll finish up with Hill\u2019s. Hill\u2019s delivered 1.5% net sales growth in the quarter. Volume grew for the third straight quarter, driven by the United States, which also delivered strong pricing growth. We were further encouraged by a rebound to volume growth in emerging markets, despite some additional pricing we put in place over the past few quarters. The U.S. continues to be led by the Prescription Diet business which has seen share growth in the vet channel as well as online. We\u2019re also seeing share gains in the Science Diet business, with our market shares in pet specialty continuing to improve year-over-year. To help continue the improved momentum on time Science Diet, Hill\u2019s was excited to sponsor NBCUniversal\u2019s fourth Clear The Shelters program, which is designed to boost pet adoption. This year has been the most successful ever with over 1,200 shelters participating and more than 100,000 pets adopted. We also grew share gains with our Hill\u2019s Bioactive Recipe dog food, which uses Hill\u2019s knowledge of dog\u2019s biology and genes respond to select ingredients so that dogs can get the most out of their food. Now, I will turn to our outlook for the balance of 2018. As stated in our press release, based on current spot rates, we expect net sales for the fourth quarter to be down low single digits due to foreign exchange with low single digit organic sales growth. We expect the additional pricing taken during the third quarter to flow through, and we expect less of an impact from destocking in the fourth quarter. Based on current spot rates, for the full year, we expect gross margin to be down year-over-year on both the GAAP basis and excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. The continued increase in raw material costs including the impact of transactional foreign exchange will continue to pressure gross margin. We now expect that advertising will be flat on both an absolute basis and as a percentage of sales for the full-year versus 2017. This change is due to some of the macro headwinds in markets like Argentina as well as some divisional mix issues. However, the media portion of advertising is projected up on an absolute basis for the full-year versus 2017 as we continue to invest behind our brand. And within that, spending continues to shift from non-working media to working media, as we drive efficiencies within our marketing budget.  On a GAAP basis, we still expect our tax rate to be between 26% and 27%. Excluding the impact from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, charges related to U.S. Tax Reform and the benefits from a foreign tax matter in 2018, we now expect our tax rate to be around 25% for the full year. Based on current spot rates, we expect GAAP earnings per share to be up double digit for the year. Excluding charges related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, charges related to U.S. Tax Reform and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018, we now expect earnings per share growth to be 3% to 4% for the year. And with that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey. Good morning. So, Ian, as you mentioned in you remarks, you talked to us previously about the plan to drive improving top-line growth in terms of innovation, ad spend, e-commerce focus et cetera. And specifics of Brazil, China weakness were helpful this quarter. But, it feels like execution was, the changes you guys have made haven\u2019t sort of been enough in light of this changing landscape. So, I\u2019d love to hear sort of going forward from today how you manage the business differently. And, I\u2019m focused on two areas. A, execution wise, are there things you could do differently going forward to sort of stay ahead of the competition in this changing channel landscape more than you had previously? And B, do you think you might need at some point to reinvest significantly behind some of these areas and increase the level of spend to get the payback you desire from a top-line standpoint? Thanks. Ian Cook : Yes. Thanks for the question, Dara. I think in terms of the way we are advancing the business, we think we\u2019re focused on the right things. Innovation is clearly a way to reach today\u2019s consumers and tomorrow\u2019s consumers. And I think we have lots of examples of innovation that is connecting with those consumers. Interestingly, if we look at our market share data and household panel data we have, we see that our market shares with millennials are the same as our general market shares. In some geographies actually, they are higher and growing. So, we think innovation is a big part of what we need going forward. And we have stepped into now changing the shape of our portfolio as part of that innovation. And that may be the transfer of a global brand to a new geography or a new retail channel, as we have described or indeed the development of a local brand, either in response to a competitor, like Vedshakti in India now transferred under a name pronounced so well by John into Thailand. And I think that will continue. And we\u2019ve also experimented as we talked about the last time with a lot of new leading edge innovation, which will find its place in the world one day. We think advertising is an important piece of it. And we do believe in those geographies where we are now seeing a consistent rebound and correction from issues we faced earlier that it is the combination of the advertising and the innovation and indeed our go-to-market execution in the case of Hill\u2019s with e-commerce. So, that is making the difference and that is sustainable going forward. And finally, I would say, in changing the shape of the portfolio, think about the addition of PCA and Elta to our Personal Care offerings, much more in the skin health area, much more linking to the recommendation model that we know so well from our oral and pet nutrition businesses. So, we think we have quite an array of freshness in what we are bringing to the consumer and are focused on the right areas in terms of where those consumers are making their purchasing decisions. And that will continue. And again, I would like to stress the journey undertaken to get to the relaunch of Total next year, which will be a big shift in a core business in our overall portfolio. As regards for significant reinvestment, I think, given our commitment and our mindset towards growth, we certainly when we will give you our guidance on 2019, will reflect the stance that we have taken. But, I must say, our portfolio of activity coming into 2019, only of which Total is public right now is quite rich. And we will certainly invest at a level that we deem appropriate to drive the top-line of the Company, while making sure that we are taking the pricing and achieving the value necessary with the premiumization of our innovation to continue to build margin and offset commodity costs that we have certainly seen this year. So, simple summary, Dara, I would say, we will do what is right to continue our focus on recovering growth momentum in next year. Operator : Our next question is from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Thanks. I just want to get a better understanding of why you expect organic sales to get better in Q4? First, is it coming more from developed or emerging markets? Because the developed markets comp, it does get a fair bit more difficult. But, I\u2019m also not entirely sure what\u2019s going to drive emerging markets better because broader expectations for China to slow down, so the retailer really destocking are actually managing to a new lower level. And in Brazil, you had mentioned the market volatility and that seems unlikely to abate as well. So, while you\u2019re spending more, it doesn\u2019t seem to have really driven much volume at this point, at least for this course. So, just if you elaborate on Q4 that would be great. Thank you. Ian Cook : Thanks, Olivia. Lot of questions there. Now, of course, when you take pricing, depending on the competitive context, you often see volatility in volume. We have experienced that before. And I guess, the point we are articulating is that given the inflationary pressures, pricing will be necessary and we will continue to focus on that going forward. As to the fourth quarter, I mean John commented on it. We do expect to see less destocking, whether that is a China or Brazil. And that will of course be a factor. We do expect our developed market performance to continue, given we think the benefit of the innovation and the advertising driving that. And we see that continuing in the fourth quarter. So, I guess, in simple terms, it is improvement from where we are in the emerging and a continuation of the developed. In China specifically, we do believe it\u2019s destocking, not putting inventory to a new level. The category is still growing mid single digits in China. And although e-commerce generally, as other have said, has slowed in its compounding rate of growth as etailers take less inventory at the front end, it still continues to be a very high contributor to growth in China and other geographies. Operator : Our next question is from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Ali Dibadj : Hey, guys. So, two questions. The first one is easy. And I\u2019m just wondering what Argentina pricing contributed to you, it\u2019s about 2% of sales I think; inflation, we\u2019ve heard 30% to 50%. So, is that the right number to think about? That\u2019s the numbers to think about? It feels like there\u2019s this kind of brewing Venezuela helping artificially your organic pricing a little bit. So, just want to kind of put that one to rest a little bit? And then, more broadly [technical difficulty] Ian Cook : Ali, you disappeared. Ali Dibadj : Hello. Can you hear me? Ian Cook : You came back. You got to the second -- yes, I didn\u2019t hear anything on the second. So, start the second again. Ali Dibadj : Okay. Thank you. Thank you for that. So, the second one is, very helpful commentary at the outset, Ian, about externalities and clearly some really tough ones around packaging costs and transportation costs, FX, destocking all the sort of stuff. And I agree with that that, some of your peers as well. But I am still struggling to find, accepting all those externalities, is there anything you know Colgate didn\u2019t do right? Is there anything, as you look introspectively that you said gosh, we just didn\u2019t do this right? Are there mistakes? Because the environment is tough, it is tough for everybody, and we\u2019re seeing market share losses still for you and a lot of things that are kind of different than some of your peers. So, I am trying to understand, as you look at yourself, what did you do wrong? Thank you. I hope you heard those. Ian Cook : Yes, I did. I heard them very clearly. Thank you. So, Argentina, Argentina is not another Venezuela brewing. In Venezuela, as you well know Ali, you had an official exchange rate that was not the operating exchange rate. Argentina is a dollarized economy, and the exchange rate is the exchange rate and it will and is fixing itself. So, your stats are also wrong. Argentina last year was about 1% of our sales; those were the good old days. And the Argentina of today is more than half smaller than it was this time last year and is around 0.5% of our sales. So, basically, ex Argentina -- the Argentina contribution overall to our organic growth rounds to zero. But, I think the bigger answer to the question is, there is no issue brewing in Argentina. The exchange will take care of itself. Secondly, thank you for the constructive nature of the second question and -- I mean in terms of recognizing some of the issues that indeed one does face. But if you singularly say, what would we be self-critical of, the answer would be not moving as quickly on premiumization as we would want to. And we are now, as you know, fully engaged in that. But that requires, as I described for China, a bold move beyond simply changing the portfolio to move the pricing of our core businesses, and that brings with it some challenges, which we will work through. But, that focus now on premiumization is very well understood and being acted upon with good urgency across businesses and across geographies. And as we said, at Barclays, when we come with the Total relaunch, that is a terrific new technology, which brings additional benefits to the consumer and is a rich opportunity to deliver value and create value going forward. So, I think that\u2019s the way I would respond, Ali. Operator : Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Just reflecting on the fact that I think it\u2019s been around six years since you introduced Global Growth and Efficiency Program. And that -- one thing that I thought about that program was sort of expanding your productivity efforts pretty demonstrably beyond gross margin and into more SG&A. And so, over these ensuing six years, I know there\u2019s been macro dynamics, but top-line growth has also slowed, even as you were embarking on this broader productivity path. So, just thinking back on some of the savings that you\u2019ve been able to generate, the areas that you focused on. Are there things that maybe efficiencies had the wrong outcome, like maybe hubbing was detrimental in some way? I\u2019m just wondering in that, if it\u2019s purely coincidental, or as you look back at some of the areas where you\u2019ve tapped into savings over the last 5 or 6 years, if there\u2019s been sort of unintended repercussions from a growth standpoint? Thanks. Ian Cook : Thanks Lauren for the questions. When we started on this journey, we were in typical Colgate fashion, a little bit conservative. The two drivers that set us on the journey. One was having the SAP enterprise-wide system that linked us across the world, which centers down the path of pushing more the administrative back office services in locations to service multiple geographies, because everybody would be connected by the same technology therefore have the visibility, and that would allow us to be cheaper and more efficient at the same time. And those moves, they\u2019re never without their challenges in the implementation of them. But, we don\u2019t have any we believe structural difficulties with them once they\u2019re in place. And indeed what starts to happen is you see your way to bringing more services to those centers around the world. So, while we were cautious stepping into it, and we have built it up over the life of the plan, we think that was a correct decision, a good decision and one that is accruing benefit today and will too, for the future. Now, hubbing, we were particularly sensitive to. Because of course, and this may be the implication of the question, we are really focused on winning on the ground as a company, and that requires agility and focus and capability on the ground. And we -- and the way we do our financials and the way we incentivize people, we have been very, very careful to maintain both the passion and the economics in terms of compensation, focused against that winning on the ground. And when we started the hubbing, we did it with -- I think it was over a decade worth of experience in a couple of geographies, Nordic and Central America that we were building out from, where we had learned the pluses and the minuses. And what hubbing essentially allows you to do is yes, become more efficient, but it also allows you to have higher quality and higher cost talent on the strategic issues governing now multiple countries, while at the same time having adequate resources on the ground to manage what is managed on the ground, which is customers and consumers and brand building. And indeed, in some geographies, we have increased the resources we have on the ground to make sure we keep that contact with customers and consumers. So, I think from its inception, the thinking was sound, based on historical experience and learning. And of course, we have learned our way over the years, the program has been evolving, to make sure we executed a quite well. So, we think on both levels, this has been an appropriate and a wise choice for the Company. Operator : Our next question is from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, and good morning. So, I wanted to go back to the competitive environment, so in particular in the U.S. and Europe. So, for the U.S., what are you seeing across competitors in terms of couponing for oral care, specifically some of your and other major categories in oral care? And for Europe, are you finally cycling some of this -- a couple -- several quarters of pricing, negative pricing. So, do you believe you can finally take some pricing now to hopefully flat and pricing into 2019 or do you believe consumers are still price sensitive there? Thank you. Ian Cook : Well, thanks for the questions, Andrea. I think we\u2019ve been quite clear over the last couple of calls that we have seen elevated promotional activity, specifically in the United States. And as John commented this morning, with electronic couponing, as before, we have adjusted our plans for the balance of the year to be more competitive in that space. We obviously will be very attentive to what unfolds in the marketplace, going forward, as everybody I think now faces the commodity cost pressures that require some prudence in terms of pricing whether price increases or lower promotional activity. So, we haven\u2019t seen any change yet but we will be attentive.  From the European point of view, Europe has always been quite a challenged environment from a pricing point of view, and that has continued for several years. It is not a new phenomenon in Europe. And some of that has led to tensions with customers over the years. And we believe now we have our European business well-positioned in that European context. And as you intimate, obviously, our pricing negative was improving in the third quarter. And clearly, we will be very attentive to try and make sure, we can continue that trend as we go forward. Operator : Our next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead Bonnie Herzog : I had a question on growth. You described this morning the slow category growth and you\u2019ve mentioned this on the past few calls. But, I guess I\u2019d like to understand, if category growth has in fact been getting worse. Have you noticed any change in the rate of growth versus Q2 or even 1H? And then, given the slow category growth, have you seen any change in the competitive environment in either the U.S. or emerging markets? And just like to hear if the promotional environment is rationale. Thanks. Ian Cook : Thanks, Bonnie. If we look at our categories generally, I think one would say, if you take a global snapshot, Europe is flat to modestly up. The U.S. is probably between 2 and 3, if you include all channels. That is certainly an improvement from recent history. Latin America is choppy, given the economic volatility there. And as we discussed earlier in Brazil in particular, there has been, as the years has unfolded, a definite slowdown in categories, both value and volume, moving to negative in the third quarter as we said. And in the Africa/Eurasia and Asia parts of the world, I think that mid-single-digit you 4% to 6% category growth continues to be the case. I will say that -- and John talked about it this morning, that in Latin America, we have seen pockets of elevated promotional activity. I intimated to it when I talked about pricing that some competitors take advantage of a leader pricing to perhaps grab a little bit of volume in the short term. But, I think our assessment that inflation will is and will continue to come back; and secondly, the underlying foreign exchange and commodity cost pressures will demand that competitors and particularly the Latin geographies will need to take pricing to offset those headwinds, and that would be our thinking going forward. Operator : Our next question is from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Please go ahead. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. Two questions. So much of your commentary, Ian, is kind of what\u2019s wrong in the marketplace, what\u2019s changing with consumers et cetera, et cetera, and how difficult the external environment is. But I\u2019m just shocked by your market share performance. I mean, the number that you give, it\u2019s your own data for the oral care category, it\u2019s just so bad. And I just don\u2019t remember time it\u2019s ever been so bad. I mean year-to-date, last year this time, it was 43.5 in toothpaste; now, it\u2019s 41.9. I just don\u2019t understand why maybe that isn\u2019t more alarming to you because that doesn\u2019t strike me as it is an external issue. It seems to me very much this is an internal issue. So, I\u2019m surprised you are more kind of grabbing the bulls by the horns and saying holy crap, excuse me, holy moly, our market shares stink. So, that\u2019s question number one. And then, question number two is, I mean I listened to the webcast when you were at Barclays and I thought you pretty clearly said you had your arms around the issues in Brazil, you had your arms around the issues in China. I thought you sounded pretty upbeat. And so, I guess my question is, did I misunderstand that, were you telegraphing that the third quarter was going to be a big miss to consensus expectations or did this come as a surprise to you at the end of the quarter? That\u2019s it. Thanks. Ian Cook : Okay. Yes. Well, I guess, I\u2019m not surprised you\u2019re shocked. I\u2019m surprised, you\u2019re surprised by my reaction. Let me come back to the market shares. The share you see there on a roll-up basis, the 41.9, on a year-on-year basis is down something like 130 basis points. The challenge with that Wendy, and it\u2019s been a challenge for, frankly, over the last five years is that there is an enormous foreign exchange component in that. And as the U.S. dollar strengthens, our extremely strong, for example, Latin American market shares become down-weighted, as part of that mix. So, there is a foreign exchange mix effect and indeed year-on-year our market share is in fact down less than half of that 1.3. Secondly, our volume share is down again, less than half our volume share decline is about 0.3 on a comparable year-to-date basis. And indeed, from a volume point of view, 1 in 2 toothpaste tubes sold are under Colgate ownership around the world. Now that said, are we happy with any share deterioration? Answer, no, we are not. But, we have said a few things. Number one, that in some parts of the world, I think Mexico, we quoted up one-time earlier this year, when promotional activity, the point is being cash margin dilutive, we will not match. And when you don\u2019t match, you lose market share. The same in the United States. And in Asia, it was a different matter. In Asia, it was local brands that we have had to meet. And recovering against those local brands is taking sometime. But, we are encouraged by the progress in India. And if I look at some of our major markets now around the world as the year unfolds, John mentioned the UK back to positive share; we are seeing positive share progression in Russia. We\u2019re seeing recent shares up in Mexico. Because now the innovation that we are bringing, the consistent support of the advertising, frankly having to match some of the promotions to a certain extent are seeing us build back shares where we have been under share pressure. We are absolutely focused on that. And I don\u2019t know what else to say other than I take the point, we understand the point, we are all over the point country-by-country, tracking it literally month-by-month and much to the pleasure o some week-by-week, depending on the geography. And we think again that the relaunch of Total at the beginning of next year and all of the oral care activity, we have behind that is another step in maintaining that focus. So, I will promise to be more excitable when I talk about market share in the future. As for Boston, yes, you didn\u2019t hear right. And, maybe one needs to be a lot more emphatic in the delivery, but we were quite clear we thought in signaling. It was on the slides that foreign exchange was going to be a big headwind and that commodities were indeed ramping up aggressively, obviously influenced by the foreign exchange impact of transaction costs. So, my answer to your second part of the question is I guess I\u2019m surprised, you missed that. Operator : Our next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English : Hey. Good morning, folks. I\u2019m going to stay on the topic of market share, bring it -- zooming in a little bit more myopic in just one region. I think, you upfront for the discourse and discussion on what\u2019s going on in Brazil, what\u2019s going on in China? Europe was a bit of a surprise to me this quarter. I know that the headline numbers look fine but Brazil headline numbers looked fine earlier this year too, and we saw how it eroded fairly quickly. In your 10-Quarter, you\u2019ve highlighted Europe as a source of market share strength with gains throughout the first half of the year. Now, the year-to-date trajectory has stated to flat, suggesting you\u2019ve actually flipped into some market share donation in the third quarter. Can you delve into the little bit more and tell us? Clearly UK has pocket of strength; where are these pockets of weakness that have begun to weigh in your market share there? Ian Cook : It\u2019s a simple answer, Jason. It\u2019s predominantly Germany. And again, without going into too much detail, it is customer related. And again, if I were going to focus on the period shares, the most recent period is beginning to return. It\u2019s as simple as that. Operator : Our next question is from Caroline Levy Macquarie. Please go ahead. Caroline Levy : Thank you. And still good morning. Just a question on the cost side. I think that you mentioned that you expect similar cost pressures in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about any hedging strategies you have on costs, particularly in emerging markets? Which particular items are the issue? Is it PET or is it -- not PET but oil related, is it transports? Just a little more detail as to how long do you think this could go on? Ian Cook : Yes. Thanks Caroline. For the third quarter, the commodity costs were up just over 8% and our logistics costs were up just over 5%. And yes, you heard correctly, we expect that to continue. And frankly, foreign exchange could be more negative for the balance of the year and that would see transaction pressure on costs as well. So, we do expect the cost pressure for the balance of this year to continue. Yes. There is of course the effect of those materials that start life as oil. And we are seeing that as others are. Hedging, we tend to be light on hedging. Many of the raw materials we buy in categories where you can hedge, and we do hedge our Hill\u2019s business, materials against the formula on a rotational basis. But for most of the rest, we rely on our ability to price when we need to as the only logical and available offset to cost pressures. Operator : Our next question is from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Stephen Powers : Hey, thanks. So, I guess, maybe trying to tie a number of things that are running through my head together. I guess, last quarter, we talked a lot about the sense of urgency that\u2019s been underpinning the recent initiatives. I think you did a good job at the time communicating that sense of urgency and distinguishing it from panic because that was the word you used. But at the same time, I think we\u2019re now at least eight quarters into what has seemingly been a pattern of organic growth and gross margin pressures. So, I guess, the question is, if we strip away the macro challenges, which I acknowledge are severe, but is the message underneath at all that from here, you think Colgate needs to be more urgent, or is there a risk that recent urgency whether it\u2019s the push into e-commerce, the catch-up on premiumization et cetera. Could actually be compounding your problems? And I guess, if it\u2019s not compounding your problems, is there anything incremental in your power to truly fast-track improvement, acknowledging the total relaunch et cetera. But, is there anything significant in your power or is it more just the question of basic block and tackling over time, hopefully with a bit of macro relief? Thanks. Ian Cook : Wow, that\u2019s a very deep and philosophical question, Steve. It is -- one has to be careful about the language one uses, I think. I can remember and I have mentioned this before, there was a time when we were under pressure in a particular geography. I won\u2019t go into the specific details, but our first reaction was, we\u2019re not panicking, we\u2019re staying calm, and the market read that as you\u2019re not taking it seriously. And the next time one responded, one said boy, we\u2019re really focused on this and we\u2019re going to meet on the beaches. And the market reaction was well now you\u2019re panicking, does that mean we should be worried about something else? So, I think my answer, Steve would be, and again this combination of innovation and advertising, which is the heart of building brands and capabilities and going where the consumers are shopping to make those brands and that portfolio available to them is where we need to be focused. And we need to do everything in our power, and we truly are to accelerate the return we get from that focus. And I\u2019m afraid, sometimes it\u2019s not as quick as people would want; it\u2019s not as quick as we would want sometimes. But, I do think in the end, building the brand, so sustainable fix is the right way to go about it. And if we find ways of expanding our portfolio as we did with PCA and Elta that is on strategy, we clearly will bring that to bear. So, I would say a heck of a lot of internal urgency but linked to that urgency is focus, focus on what we believe to be the right things category-by-category, geography-by-geography, store-by-store, etailer-by-etailer. And again, I think the total relunch in the first quarter of next year is a very important part of our oral care business, will be a meaningful step under our control developed over many years to advance that business and with it, the company. Operator : Our next question is from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kevin Grundy : Question, Ian, I wanted to pivot to the U.S. pricing environment. Proctor said, they\u2019re much more optimistic on its ability to take price. And at high level, Proctor indicated U.S. retailers are now more receptive to pricing across categories. And that certainly wasn\u2019t the narrative among investors earlier in the year. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty, which called into question brand strength and economic, most of these businesses, et cetera. And Proctor also indicated plan to take price in oral care. So, the first part, can you comment on how you see the pricing environment shaping up across categories? Do you share Proctor\u2019s view that there is a much broader receptivity to pricing, it did not exist even a quarter or two ago, do you plan to follow Proctor\u2019s pricing in oral care? Maybe talk a little bit about opportunities take pricing elsewhere. Is it more conducive now as it seems to be? And then, lastly, I don\u2019t expect you to guide, Ian, but margins down in North America 200 basis points year-to-date or something close to it. Should we expect to see margins improve looking out the next year in North America? So, thanks for all that. Ian Cook : Thanks very much, Kevin. I guess, as far as one can responsibly go on a call like this, which is a public call, I think a fair way to answer it is, I think it is fair to say that everybody in the industry understands that there are cost pressures. And all players in the industry are going to have to find ways that are consistent with their strategy and their relationships with their retail partners to do that. And that can be a combination of a lot of things from efficiency, to revised promotional calendars, to premium innovation, to different promotional activity. And yes, indeed, to a price increase. And we obviously partner very closely with our key retailers here in United States. And we are very attentive in working with them to bring value to consumers that they see and they think it\u2019s good value to pay for. And that\u2019s what drives our thinking in this space including the total relaunch coming next year. And I think we were one of the ones earlier than many, saying this commodity cost trend was real and the industry would need to be responsive. So, you can rest assured we will be both attentive and responsive. Operator : Our next question is from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Bill Chappell : Two hopefully quick ones. One on China. The destock seems pretty identical to what happened last year. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand, is this kind of the way you see it going forward with e-commerce growing that we\u2019re going to have kind of a one destock per year, that\u2019s going to affect a given quarter. And then, the second, on Total, on the relaunch. Should we be thinking -- I know you\u2019re not giving guidance, but thinking about kind of a frontend loaded and a stepped up marketing and advertising spend behind that, or is that fairly kind of normal within the kind of normal plans in terms of the launch? Ian Cook : I think on China, a good question, Bill. No, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re talking about a once a year destock in China. I think, the emergence of online created turbulence and destocking and has now complicated the distribution channels in China, particularly the indirect distribution channels. Because candidly, some of the online players now have distribution systems themselves. So, retailers in the chain can buy from four or five different sources, which is very different than when the e-commerce phenomenon began in China last year. So, it\u2019s a different impact now, really driven by us taking pricing now into a more complicated distribution structure and needing the pricing to equivalize and work its way through the system before we can get the new pricing on shelf with indirect customers. So, that\u2019s a very different reason for the destocking. And as I said, this one is going to take a little bit of time in that indirect trade. But we expect it to get better from here. And when we talked about Total being the first quarter of next year, the way we signaled it at Barclays, Bill, was that the global rollout of this activity would begin in the first quarter of next year. So, that doesn\u2019t say that all of the activity is happening in the first quarter. But yes, of course, when we do bring such an important initiative with such technology and greater value, we will be investing very diligently to make sure all stakeholders are aware of and get a chance to try the product. Operator : And our final question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. I\u2019m going to try to ask the appropriate level of spend question in a different way. So, if we fast forward to 2019, I know you are not going to comment on sales guidance, but unless you say business accelerate towards even the low end of long-term target next year and if you extrapolate to your trends, perhaps that\u2019s where you end up. So, if you get there, given the period share loss you had or issues had in certain key markets, how would you think about the appropriate level of spend? I mean, what does that mean to you? Are you more likely to want to protect the share that you\u2019ve started to see improvement upon? Are you likely to think about things in a different way from an overall advertising spend. So, not necessarily that you need to rebase to get back to growth. But, let\u2019s just say, you do get back to growth, how do you feel about protecting that relative to where you\u2019ve come from? Ian Cook : Yes. Very good question, Mark. Look, we think about it, and what we\u2019ve been trying to telegraph is that advertising builds brands over time. And so, our thinking from a growth point of view is to continue to support our equities and the core and base businesses behind those equities, and of course, build the awareness to generate trial of innovation. So, we will be deploying advertising, our thinking, we haven\u2019t yet begun our budgeting process to what we can measure and regard as effective levels to do the job of maintaining the strength of the underlying equity and building awareness and trial for new products, including the shift to digital and not forgetting commitment to the consumption building programs that we have in the emerging markets, which deliver benefit over a longer period of time. So that\u2019s the way we tend to think about it. And I would venture to say, as we work our way through our budgeting process that will be the way we will think about it for 2019. So, thanks everybody for your questions. And I wish a good rest of the day. And we look forward to catching up with you the early part of next year. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call. And we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John. John Faucher : Thanks, Loren. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Joining me this morning are; Ian Cook, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Noel Wallace, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Henning Jakobsen, Chief Financial Officer. Ian and Noel will start off with their thoughts, while I will cover our Q4 results and 2019 guidance. Ian Cook : Good morning, everyone. It's Ian. Let me first wish you all a belated happy and healthy 2019. And let me start my introductory comments where we started the press release. We are pleased with the improvement in organic sales in the fourth quarter, plus 2% on top of plus 2% in the fourth quarter of 2017, and you will recall that the 2% in the fourth quarter of 2017 was the highest quarter that year. Said a different way, on a two-year stacked basis, we accelerated from 1% in the third quarter to 4% in the fourth quarter. So we entered 2019 with momentum. I think our intense focus on innovation, sustained advertising and product expansions in new channels and markets is beginning to pay off. You may recall that our biggest problem businesses 12 months ago are now the ones growing the fastest. Hill's, four quarters of accelerating growth, driven by Prescription Diet which is the backbone of the business and the line that creates the recommendations from the best, a strong U.S. business and our continued high growth in e-commerce. And as you will hear later from in Noel, there is big news coming on the other half of the Hill's business, Science Diet in 2019. Africa/Eurasia, we cycled through our distributor issues. We're focused back on driving distribution and advertising support and we're back to growth and India now posting continued healthy organic sales growth, driven by innovation, Vedshakti, which is building distribution and continuing to build market share. On a national basis Vedshakti is now up to 1.7 shares, seven months of continuous share growth. And in the modern trade where distribution obviously builds quicker; and trial, and therefore share growth is faster, Vedshakti is now up to 4.4% market share five months of share increase. And several other markets are on plan and expectation that we discussed in the third quarter are all generally doing better. Mexico and Brazil, we saw sequential improvement which helped drive Latin America to positive growth. We are taking pricing as we said we would and we are sticking with that strategy. In the case of Mexico, we have seen that market become somewhat less promotional and the category growth is coming back. In Brazil, the category growth is still modest and the heightened promotional activity we had mentioned before continues, so we balance our business in Brazil, responding where we need to but sticking to our underlying strategy of taking the necessary pricing. China; sequential improvement as we said, but still negative. Consumption continues to look fine and the pricing is working its way slowly to consumers. We expect to see continued sequential improvement in the first half and return to growth in the second half of this year. And finally a market often discussed in these calls, the U.K. where we are seeing strong growth driven by increasing market share which in turn is being driven by our premium business in the U.K. And that's before the impact of the Total re-launch in the U.K. And in the U.K. the Total brand is a 16-share substantial business. However life is not perfect and we have had two markets affected by specific issues. In Europe we had the disturbances called by the Gilets Jaunes or the yellow vests. And that in fact was a headwind to European organic growth of some 40 basis points. As you see yourselves in the news, while the disturbances are still there they are more subdued than they were during the fourth quarter. And here in the United States, we saw a little bit of slowing in terms of category growth. We were preparing to bring Total to the marketplace in the first quarter and therefore working shelf inventory down a little to make for an easy transition. But the biggest headwind in North America was onetime very specific and entirely mechanical and that was the shift of a major promotional activity from 2018 to 2019 from a shipments point of view and that happened later in the quarter and that was a 120 basis points shift from fourth quarter organic into the first quarter of 2019. And the final comment I'll make on 2018 is that, as we have been saying for awhile as planned, we laid on pricing. And we believe it is paying-off despite the expected volume impact. We are beginning to see some competitors follow the Mexico/Brazil contrast is relevant in that case, but as one has to say on pricing it is early days and we will see how the markets evolve and what the competitive reaction is. So let's turn to 2019. Our intense focus on innovation and bringing our products to new channels and markets supported by a meaningful increase in advertising continues. The innovation grid we have in 2019 is uniquely and especially strong, particularly on some scale core businesses in addition to many of the adjacencies that we have in our portfolio. This is the opportunity to accelerate our growth which is why we have guided to the 2% to 4% organic growth increase. And Noel will talk in some detail about the growth plans that we have in 2019. The area I want to talk about for 2019 is our continued focus on pricing and that is for two reasons. One is a continued focus on premiumizing our portfolio. And the second is offsetting underlying costs including the transactional impact of foreign exchange. So, if I take a step back and just give you a view on the underlying commodity cost trends on our business, for 2018 the overall increase in underlying commodity costs was 7%. In the third quarter as we told you, it was 8%. In the fourth quarter, it was 9% and for 2019, our plan calls for a 6% increase in underlying commodity costs. Now obviously given the shape of 2018 and as John will reaffirm in his prepared remarks. The cost headwinds will be higher in the first half of 2019. Foreign exchange for 2019 which brings the transactional costs on top of the underlying commodity costs for the year, we expect to be in the 2% to 2.5% range. Now importantly and pleasingly, over two-thirds of our 2019 pricing is either rollover pricing from 2018 or pricing already accepted as part of the significant re-launches of the Total business and the Hill's Science Diet business. In other words, already accepted and in place. And the net result of that scenario for 2019 is that we expect our gross profit to increase 30 and 50 basis points. So, those are the framing remarks I would like to put on 2019 and simply, we're pleased it is a unique opportunity to accelerate the growth of our organic topline. And as some of you may recall, in the second and third quarter calls in response to questions, we emphasized the fact that we were building a plan in 2019 that would reflect the quality and depth of activity we have. That's what we've done and we have confidence in that plan. So, here's Noel to give you a little bit more on growth. Noel Wallace : Thanks Ian and good morning everyone. As Ian mentioned in his opening remarks, our number one priority is to accelerate organic sales growth. So, this morning I'm going to discuss three key areas of focus to improve our organic sales performance for 2019 and beyond. You'll year from more from me on this at CAGNY, but I want to provide some initial thoughts to you today. First, we're driving the core of our business to innovation and improved brand building. Second, we're using innovation to grow in adjacent categories and product segments. And third, we're expanding the availability of our products to distribution to new markets and new channels. Let me start with growing the core. As you know we have big core businesses that represent the majority of our sales and are the key driver of Colgate status as one of the most penetrated consumer back brands in the world. It is important to keep these core businesses vital and growing to innovation, strong marketing support, and the right consumer messaging. You will see significant innovation against our core in 2019 including the Colgate Total relaunch which is the biggest news we've had this brand in its more than 20-year history. With this introduction, we are inventing the multi-benefit category that Colgate created. We're invigorating anchor brand and driving consumer engagement, trial, and market share. It's not easy taking a great formula and making [Indiscernible] so we're excited to bring this breakthrough technology to market this year. The new Colgate Total improves upon the previous version providing several new benefits; including a sensitivity benefit across all variants, instant neutralization of odors associated with bad breath, the ability to seek and fight bacteria for enamel protection, and new cooling agents for lasting freshness. Importantly, the added benefits allow us to take pricing which should help us drive our global value shares higher, particularly, in key markets like the U.S. and Brazil. And as you would expect, we would support this launch with a new increase in brand-building activity. In U.S. we expect to generate significant consumer awareness with a record number of in-store displays and advertising that we developed specifically for this year's Super Bowl. The rest of the world would also see a significant increase in advertising and trade activity. And Colgate Total is not the only core innovation you'll see from us this year. 2019 also marks the relaunch of our Hill's Science Diet business with new SKUs hitting the stores in the U.S. in the first quarter and rolling out globally over the next 12 months. Our Science Diet sales and market share performance has accelerated over the past several quarters behind improved advertising and higher spending levels, distribution gains and continued strength in e-commerce, the re-launch allow us to build on recent successes. The Science Diet re-launch includes upgrading the recipes and improving cable shakes. And for pet parents, we've completely redesigned our packaging graphics in a way that will enhance their shopping experience and give them a greater understanding on Hill's brand purpose. We believe this re-launch also provides us with the opportunity to increase pricing. We're very excited to build on Science Diet strong momentum from 2018. So it's vital to have a healthy core, which includes some of our most important brands. Still, we know we need to continue to innovate into faster growing adjacent categories and segments. You have heard us talk a lot about Naturals and by the end of 2018 we had Naturals offerings in toothpastes in 79 countries. We continue to expand our Natural offerings in toothpaste based on local insights with the launch of charcoal variant across many countries with encouraging early results. As Ian mentioned, our Colgate Vedshakti line in India continues to see solid share performance with seven straight quarters of sequential share improvement. In the modern trade, which is Vedshakti's strongest channel, the franchise achieved a 4.4 share in the fourth quarter. In Germany, we're excited about the launch of Meridol cure for this quarter. We developed a formula that allows us to combine Meridol strong therapeutic heritage with natural ingredients to improve gum health. Naturals is also a key area of focus in personal and home care. We continue to be pleased with the performance in the Sanex brand with a 0% line is a key factor in driving growth and we've expanded this line into the U.K. We're also expanding our Palmolive Vel Rosita\u00e4 Personal Care line across Latin America and are launching new body wash and handsoap lines including Palmolive Play in Europe. In Home Care, we're launching under the Ajax brand a number of household cleaner variance using natural ingredients like essential oils, baking soda and citronella. So we've covered how we're driving the core and expanding into adjacent growing segments. Now I want to focus on how we are pushing even more aggressively into faster growth channels and expanding geographic footprint of our brands. We are launching Elmex and Meridol in the pharmacy channel in new markets this year. We're also expanding the distribution of our professional skincare businesses PCA Skin and EltaMD in spas and dermatologists where we're seeing strong growth. One of the most exciting programs we have in place for this year is the launch of Hill\u2019s to home, a new e-commerce platform that allows pet parents to purchase prescription diet products directly from their veterinarian to arrive for home delivery. The pet parents initially signs up for their program through their vet, who enters the appropriate Prescription Diet food recommendation. This new system allows us to maintain the key relationship between Hill's, our vet partners and pet parents while still providing a convenient to that home delivery it is crucial in this category. By enrolling the pet parents in that subscription-based program we also increased compliance with prescriptions, which leads to better health outcomes for their pets and importantly a higher ROI for Hill's. Another areas of our business, we're looking on our e-commerce and direct consumer partners with Hubbell and bond based shave club to further build our capabilities in digital, e-commerce and direct-to-consumer which will allow us to expand our offerings and strengthen our consumer relationships. For example, in the fourth quarter we launched at-home whitening kits to our e-commerce platform in China. So this is our focus. Drive the core, growing adjacencies in new product segments and expand into new channels and markets. I hope this gives you a better understanding our plans and priorities to invest to accelerate organic sales growth in 2019 and beyond. Now I'll turn it over to John. John Faucher : Thanks, Noel. In order to leave time for some Q&A, I will forgo the normal divisional review and simply discuss the Q4 financials and then our 2019 guidance. Our net sales declined 2% in Q4. The 0.5% unit volume growth and 2.5% favorable pricing were offset by negative 5% impact from foreign exchange. Our recently acquired professional skincare businesses EltaMD and PCA Skin contributed 1% to net sales and unit volume growth in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, our gross profit margin was down 70 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, it was down 100 basis points year-over-year. For the quarter, our 250 basis points of pricing provided a 110 basis point benefit to gross margin. Raw material costs, including foreign exchange transaction costs, were a 490 basis point drag on gross margin year-over-year. Our productivity program, led by our Funding the Growth initiatives, provided a 280 basis point benefit to gross margin. On an absolute basis, advertising investment was up 2% year-over-year in Q4, with increases across every division except Latin America, which was impacted by foreign exchange and reductions in spending in Argentina related to the recent devaluation. On a percent to sales basis, advertising was up year-over-year in Q4. Excluding charges resulting from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program and advertising spending, our SG&A expenses were down year-over-year in Q4 on an absolute basis, but up as a percent of sales, driven by the continued increases in logistics costs. The remainder of our overhead costs were down on an absolute basis and flat as a percentage to sales, benefiting from our productivity programs. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share of $0.70 were up 89% year-over-year in Q4. Excluding charges resulting from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program and the charge related to U.S. tax reform in 2017, diluted earnings per share were down 1% at $0.74. Looking to 2019. As stated in the press release, based on current spot rates we expect net sales to be flat to up low single digits with organic sales growth of 2% to 4% and a negative impact from foreign exchange. Based on current spot rates, for the full year we expect gross margin to be up year-over-year on both the GAAP basis and excluding charges related to our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. We expect the benefits of pricing and our productivity programs to offset an overall increase in raw material costs, which includes the impact of transactional foreign exchange. We are assuming that raw material prices increase from current levels. In order to support innovation that Noel discussed, we plan that advertising will be up meaningfully in 2019, both on an absolute basis and as a percent of sales versus 2018. We will continue our efforts to drive greater effectiveness and efficiency in our advertising spending by improving the impact of our advertising, shifting advertising dollars into higher ROI media and reducing non-working media expenditures. We expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be between 25.5% and 26.5%, both on a GAAP basis and excluding charges related to our Global Growth and Efficiency Program in 2019 and 2018 and charges related to U.S. tax reform and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018. On a non-GAAP basis this is an increase versus our 2018 tax rate. Based on current spot rates, we expect GAAP earnings per share to be down low single-digits for the year. Excluding charges related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in 2019 and 2018 and charges related to the U.S. tax reform and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018, we expect earnings per share to decline mid-single digits for the year, which includes a negative impact of translational foreign exchange. While we feel good about the programs we had in place for 2019 as Noel discussed, we feel it is prudent to factor in uncertainty in global economies, exchange rates and the competitive environment. I would also highlight that we expect foreign exchange and raw material headwinds to be higher in the first half of the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ian for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hi, good morning guys. Ian Cook : Good morning, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So, Ian and Noel obviously highlighted the strong innovation pipeline on the call numerous times with Total and Science Diet as well as all the other products. Can you help quantify that for us, how much of the top line growth this year you're expecting to come from innovation? How different is that than a typical year? And obviously, you're assuming a large increase in A&P spending in 2019 in your guidance, can you give us a bit more detail on where exactly that's going to be focused? Is it mainly just the innovations or given such a large magnitude are there other base geographies or product categories your focused on? And then last, what gives you the confidence behind the payback from that? And we did see a big add increase in the back half of 2017 in organic sales growth that accelerated in 2018 and would imagine innovations a bigger part of the answer, but what's giving you confidence in the payback from higher spent in terms of top line growth? Thanks. Ian Cook : Thanks for the one question, Dara. So let me take them in turn. What is not typical about 2019 is the scale innovation on what Noel is calling the core businesses. Now we had mentioned Science Diet before. This is the first time we had mentioned Science Diet. We mentioned Total before which is a seven-share global brand. And Science Diet as I say is that nearly half of the Hill's business and these will not be the only scale businesses you'll be hearing about in 2019. That is different from traditional innovation cycles. On top of that, as Noel said, we have the adjacent work that is underway on Naturals across the portfolio and quite a broad array of what I would call normal innovation on the business. So the big difference -- and I'm not going to break out in a quantification sense, but the big difference is scale business -- scale core business, relaunches which by the way terrific technology, terrific consumer acceptance, and we know now with Total, terrific advertising vehicles that have tested extraordinarily well. To your second point -- and again, I think this is an important point to make. One of the reasons we talked over the last couple of years about sustaining advertising investment and is you need to do two things; you need to maintain the relevance of the equity of our brand which means maintaining continuous advertising support behind the brand in the world with lots of distractions and change. In 2019, the advertising at that we are putting behind these scaled innovations is incremental advertising. So, we're maintaining advertising support on the equity and we are adding advertising to drive awareness and trial which gets repeat and then builds into a virtual cycle of continuous growth. But we need to get trial of products that are new that are scaled products. So, that is the focus of the advertising. And within that you obviously have the continued shift to case of Hill's, it's all digital. So, you have those executional intricacies. But from a big picture point of view that is the approach. And we're confident in the payback in the sense of the expectation we have for growth and market share on those innovations which as we have said have taken a long time to bring together and we think will set change of the business going forward. In other words create an inflection point for the growth of the company that based on the quality of products, will continue beyond 2019. So, that's the confidence. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good morning folks and belated Happy New Year to you as well. Its early lots of ground I guess we could cover. But I'm just going to focus on Total, because clearly, it's a big focal point for you right now. As a step back and as we talk to investors, there's some degree of skepticism on whether or not this can really move the needle. New and improved propositions don't usually move the needle in a big way. It seems like many of the market share gainers in the key categories are winning a distinct benefit platforms rather than universal beneficial bundles such as Total. So, can you give us a sense of -- or could you give us little more specificity on what drives your enthusiasm and what maybe -- the investment community may not be appreciating? And then related to this, you haven't really mentioned the removal of triclosan from the formula as part of the upgrade platform benefit. Is that because it doesn't really matter? Or is there benefit that comes with that too, whether it be broadening aperture to call it consumers or markets, et cetera? Thank you. Ian Cook : Yes. Jason there is innovation every year and we see a barrage of labels that say new and improved. But frankly like most things in life there's new and improved and new and improved. And this we view as the biggest breakthrough since we came with the original Total product. It has been many years in the making in terms of delivering the claims that Noel has mentioned in delivering the flavors that have as much indeed better appeal than the existing flavor which in a taste business is something you have to be very focused on. And most importantly, the consumer has reactivated in all of our testing, interestingly not just consumer testing, but in market testing that we did if you will under the radar with no advertising, but at significantly higher pricing, because of the quality of the product and the consumer response is very good. And that is why I made the point about the quality of the advertising as well. So, we know we have a quality product. We do see it as breakthrough. We have been working with dental professionals since the fourth quarter of last year to convey the richness of studies we have behind the product. And we now have advertising that we know is persuasive and motivating and got through with customers. And on top of that, we are getting extraordinary support from our retail partners in terms of shelving and in terms off-shelf display to generate the trial of the product. And that's why I'm sort of distinguishing the scale of these core relaunches. This is not sort of couple of blue dots in and call it new and improved. So it's a big difference and it's why we are investing through all of the stakeholders involved in the brand that it is a breakthrough which is incremental investment, because trial bills over a two year period for a new product so the time is now. Now triclosan we are in different. We were quite clear when we spoke about this relaunch at Barclays last September that the new formula would replace the existing formula that contains triclosan that happens to be because we have a better product today than we had with the old product. And that was a great product and we stood behind that product all the time from a scientific point of view. This just happens to be a better product and that's where we are moving to. Operator : We'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks, good morning. Ian Cook : Good morning, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Good morning. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about drivers of toothpaste global category growth sort of comparing maybe the last five years versus what you see coming maybe over the next five sort of thinking about the units market penetration usage versus premiumization. Because it sounds like you've been talking consistently about premiumization that's been a biggest trend in some of your major markets. But I also feel like it's not that long ago that you were still highlighting sort of the actual market penetration usage opportunity. If you could talk a little bit about the balancing of the sort of last five years looking forward and how you're thinking about that as part of your strategy will be great? Ian Cook : Yes. Lauren good question. It's not an exclusive thing. One trend in the marketplace is that the value growth of the marketplace is accelerating because of premiumization. Premiumization happens in two ways; one is great businesses get better, creates more value for the consumer and receive more value as a brand which is the Total story. The second is we see many smaller brands at premium pricing in niche segments in the category. And I talked a little bit earlier about Vedshakti. We could talk about Tom's of Maine, which continues to grow quite nicely, which is a unique brand. We could talk about -- again about the charcoal variance what had been mention. So, when we talk about premiumization, it's both of those things. We're not just talking about Total. And we also are not forgetting the penetration opportunity in the world. I have said before on these calls that still our volume share is higher than our volume share; one out of two physical tubes of toothpaste on the planet are Colgate tubes of toothpaste. And yes, we want the premiumization. But we also want the users of our product -- and one of the reasons our volume share is higher is because when we entered markets, we made sure that we had the portfolio that had an entry price point that was available to the most rural market entry consumer we could find. And then behind that we have put the Bright Smiles, Bright Futures programs in those emerging markets. We have talked recently about the work we are doing across Africa which has been stepped-up substantially. And I would repeat when we talk about investment, yes, we're putting in investment behind the innovation, but we are also increasing the investment behind market penetration because we think that that is an important aspect of our sustainable growth over time just based on the average use of toothpaste and the users around the world. So, they're not mutually exclusive, I guess, is the point. We have focused on the innovation because that is a big driver for 2019. But by no means does that mean we are reducing our effort on building market penetration. Operator : We'll take our next question from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Ian Cook : Good morning Nik. Nik Modi : Good morning. I was just -- thanks Noel for those comments about kind of where you're focused. Maybe both Noel and Ian you can answer, when you think about the 2% to 4% for 2019, is there any way you can give us perspective on the waitings? Like how important would the relaunches be relative to perhaps some of the white space opportunities and the distribution opportunities? Just providing a little bit more clarity around the drivers of that 2% to 4% would be helpful. And then maybe what kind of what your expectation is for just general category growth for 2019? Thanks. Ian Cook : Yes, I think if we take the categories and you look around the world, we're in a place where you see Europe still flat to 1%, you see North America north of 2%, and you see the emerging markets in that 4% to 6% range. When you take it all together you're talking about 2%, 2.5% underlying category growth rates. Now if I come back to what's going to drive the shape of that 2% to 4%, I'm not going to break down the scale versus the underlying business is because we are doing a lot of smart things on all of the other businesses that we have. But it is the combination of those that give us the confidence in that 2% to 4% spread, particularly entering the year of the encouraging 2% in the fourth quarter. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Great. Thank you very much. A question on the implied reinvestment this year, I guess, I'm just looking for a little bit more clear specificity if I could. On how much of that is envisioned to go into A&P versus into new capabilities that may not be considered advertising but might touch up in base level SG&A things like as it relates to digital and e-commerce or the Naturals push? Because there's a fair amount of reinvestment implied in the guidance and I'm just trying to figure out if that is truly 100% A&P or there if it's spread across broader SG&A? Thank you. Ian Cook : Yeah. A good question, Steve. A large part of it is A&P \u2013 a large part of it is A&P. When you start breaking down SG&A you're also going to see that we have logistics in our SG&A and that has topped out reasonably high at the end of this year. And if it continuous at the same level when you look at the fourth quarter that will be a component of the increase \u2013 an in SG&A. And yes you're right to the extent that digital is requiring personnel and locations and capabilities that might get picked up elsewhere in SG&A. We have also been putting that in place and that underlies Noel's comment about extending into those areas. So you're going to see a bit of logistics predominantly A&P and then also a little bit in the overhead area supporting our continued push into the digital space. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Good morning. Ian Cook : Good morning, Bonnie. Bonnie Herzog : Hi. I had a few questions on your guidance. I was hoping you guys could help bridge the GAAP between your long-term EPS growth target and then your EPS guidance this year between I guess capital spending the higher tax rate and the FX headwinds? And also is this higher level spending a new norms for you and really what's necessary for you guys to drive faster growth in this environment? And finally you're forecasting operating margin contraction this year, but do you anticipate the contraction to be less than it was last year? Ian Cook : Yes. Again, thank you for the single question. I think the most important focus in 2019 is to continue progress on accelerating growth off an encouraging fourth quarter. And I think two things to say, you kind of really asked two questions; one is what happens longer term from a return point of view; and the other was is this cost of doing the business. So let me kind of break the two. And we're not going to get into discussions about 2020, because it's too much uncertainty between now and then in terms of what could happen with foreign exchange, raw materials and other factors. Our spending this year is dictated by the amount of activity that we have on our core businesses as well as the other opportunities that Noel talked about. And we believe that this level of support and the quality of the innovation should drive an improvement in our organic sales growth in that 2% to 4% range. That will of course leave us in a better position as we enter 2020 and beyond. And if our plan evolves the way we are expecting, raw material pressures will lessen in the second half as will foreign exchange which should lead to a sequential improvement in our earnings growth rate and bring us into 2020 with good momentum. And that will set us up for 2020 and beyond. Now if you flip it the other way and say is this investment behind growth or is this simply the cost of doing the business, you can kind of step back from that question as well. And I think it's been clear that for the past several years, one could say since the financial crises growth has been more challenging. And what can happen and we have observed does happen is that when growth is challenging that people are willing to pay more for it and you see that in our categories and you sometimes see and we have seen and we have commented about competitive activity that is more in the trade spending area to drive volume rather than build brands. So that said, we're not spending more because we have to but because we have innovation and marketing programs that are worth spending on now. Now one thing I would say and I should have said in response to an earlier question, one encouraging aspect at this time is that pricing appears to get better. I had talked about you have seen the pricing we got in the fourth quarter. I talked about the rollover pricing and the Total and Hill's pricing that is already set at over two-thirds of our pricing in 2019. So, if we move into an environment where pricing is positive and you're hearing similar commentary from many in our space and competition happens in the advertising line not above the net revenue line then marketing and innovation will win out not price promotion. And I think we view that as a good thing for the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ian Cook : Morning Ali. Ali Dibadj : Morning and Noel nice to hear you on the call. So, look I'm glad your filing increasing investments in 2019, but I do want to push a little bit more on whether it's enough. A second ago you said you're not doing it because you need to, but because you got stuff behind you -- innovation, et cetera, behind you. So, I want to push on whether you think is enough because you're still losing global market share, emerging markets, in particular, and you just mentioned a few questions ago, 4% to 6% EM category growth, you're 1.5%. If you look at your press release and kind of tradition of when there's a mission and market share gains means you're not gaining or you're, in fact, losing and that's Mexico, Brazil, Russia, India, China, maybe South Africa. And we like the strategy. We like that you're launching Elmex and Meridol and new channels in new geographies to help the Colgate brand out. We like the innovation, but usually that's kind of a long road. It's not a one-year type thing. And so with all that -- and to answer against a previous question tying it back together, it feels like there's maybe 100 basis points or so increase in ad spending in 2019. Do you expect that to just be a one-time increase in A&P? Do you think you'll have to continue raising your spend to maybe something north of 11% or 12% or 13%. We certainly believe that might be a possibility over the next few years. And that will continue win on growth because usually these -- you've been in the industry for a long time, we've observed this for a while. It's not a won and done typically, right? It's usually multi-year turnaround, multi-year investments. So, just push you on that is this enough? Is this all we're going to hear in terms of a reinvestment here? Ian Cook : Yes, as usual a very well-framed question. I think the answer has to be that we believe it is because that is the plan we have put together and the way I think I would frame it; I tried to capture it a little bit in the answer to the previous question. There is a difference between to your point innovation in niches that do take time to grow. We're very pleased with Vedshakti, but it's taking time to build. We know we have a winning product. We will be patient and we will be successful. So, again, I come back to the difference here is your taking scale businesses. You're making significant relaunches with better quality product perceivable to the consumer and you are focusing your investment on generating trial. When you generate the trial, our data says we will get elevated levels of repeat and that becomes a virtual cycle. If these businesses, as we plan and expect them to do, driver growth and market share, then as you progress through year, you come out of 2019 in a very good place, growth reestablished, scale businesses to your point about market share with growing market shares and then you enter 2020 in a very different place with an activity array that will be different, strong. Clearly 2020 has been worked upon for a while and we we\u2019ll decide based on that activity plate what is the necessary level of investment. But it'll be driven by the activity that we have and based on our planning it will be driven by activity on a 2019 that sees us get back to a stronger rate of growth. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Thanks good morning everyone. Ian Cook : Hi Kevin. Kevin Grundy : Hey good morning Ian. Question on cost structure, as we know it's not uncommon to see companies lean in a bit harder on cost savings in an effort to fund some of the stepped up reinvestment when we see the EPS reset kind of years, but that wasn\u2019t outlined this morning. We didn't see an expansion of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program or step-up and savings expected from funding the growth. So while I don't want to put words in your mouth, presumably there's a certain level of comfort with what the company has already outlined. So I can appreciate sensitivity on the topic, but one, was that a consideration as you were building the plan with what looks like it's going to be about 100 basis points of hurt to the P&L in the year? And then two on that topic maybe perhaps just provide an update on how you see opportunity on this front with respect to cost savings? Thank you for that. Ian Cook : Yes. No thank you and fair question. You can rest assured actually if I take funding the growth first, when you go through our gross margin role forward, I know John did it in general but our funding the growth savings in the fourth quarter were 280 basis points compared to 250 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017. So you can rest assured that internationally we have as challenging a goal in place for 2019 and suffice to say we tend to push a little beyond the goals we have established. So there is no lack of focus on trying to generate more from our funding the growth program. On the Global Growth and Efficiency Program you will remember way extended it one year. We have a variety of new initiatives already baked in that take advantage of the steps we've been making in the three major areas which is the hubbing, the shared service centers and the rationalization continuing on facilities. And of course, we are working very diligently to see if you can train the new, not yet in the plan opportunities that we can add to those initiatives. And if we find them we will certainly pursue them and we are certainly looking forward to them. So it was not absent. We have set a plan where we are, but we have not -- we are not stopping looking aggressively. Operator : Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : Thank you. My question is around your investments in e-commerce and direct-to-consumer. Because while it doesn't sound like there's a ton of incremental spend on the development here, I was curious how your thought process is changing to capture a greater share of our consumers. So like on regular online, how much is focused on changing formulations packaging et cetera versus a change in potentially the messaging around post side bars things like that? And then, can you elaborate a little bit more on your direct-to-consumers initiatives, you mentioned Hill's to Home. But you're already big in Hill's here, so is that -- where's sort of the incremental in that? And what are you taking from the Hill's lowering capabilities into the other parts of your business? Thank you. Ian Cook : Okay, well let me -- from an e-commerce point of view, one of the reasons and indeed it was Noel that brought the partnerships in one of the reasons we are pondering with Hubble and with Bombay Shave is to give us some external insight into these areas, techniques that we can experiment with. And so yeah, we are exploring all of the different ways you can go-to-market from an e-commerce point of view and will continue to broaden what we experiment with going forward. And the Hill's direct-to-consumer, the importance of that is that there are certain group of consumers but for further convenience of shopping online. And yet for a prescription product, you need a vet recommendation and indeed they often seek of that recommendation. So if you're a dyed in the wool online shopper, right now you can't get that from your local vet online. You have to get it physically from that local vet. So this provides the capability to maintain the engagement of the vet and yet give the recipient of the product, the product delivered in the way they want and we have found with our subscription modeling, but of course at that gives the Pats actually better quality health in the sense that they will stay on the diet and get the full benefit of the product. Noel Wallace : Olivia, maybe I'll jump in and just add a couple -- a little bit of flavor to that. Obviously, we're increasing our spending in digital. We see a pretty substantive acceleration in digital moving into 2019 as we saw in 2018 which we think is certainly having an impact on our e-commerce shares. As you may have seen our e-commerce shares in the U.S. are up 60 basis points. In toothpaste, we are clearly the number one player in that category with a delta of about five share points to our nearest competitor. Our shares in highly competitive China market are flat this year and in our view generate a significant amount of learning and we'll be looking to bring new innovations specifically to that channel in China in 2019 to accelerate that growth. And then our biggest e-commerce business as you're well aware of is our Hill's business which had a terrific year in e-commerce, up 50 basis points. And we're very, very happy with what the progress that team is making in terms of how they are using digital which as you may recall is their only medium of advertising. They spend a 100% in that area behind the business. And we certainly see that paying off both in our e-commerce shares as well as our brick-and-mortar shares. The success of the Hill's business throughout the year was sequential and the shares are supporting that coming back to that question our vet channel shares which are Prescription Diet were up 60 basis points. And our pet superstore business which is Science Diet were up 60 basis points. So, again, we think the focus and the learning that we're getting behind digital spending and how that interacts and plays into our e-commerce business is well constructed. Operator : We'll take our next question from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. Wondering if you could give us some more insights into your business and commercial moment in China. I think in the opening comments you said you expect to see improvement in the second half. So, maybe some -- what are the drivers for that? And then perhaps touch on how Dare to Love program is going with Alibaba? What are you seeing from that? Anymore progress or initiatives with Alibaba? And also touch on premiumization in China and Elmex? Thank you. Ian Cook : Yes. Well, thanks Robert. China, as we said, made sequential improvement, but continued to be down as we work through the very complicated destocking areas to get the pricing -- substantial pricing that has been taken to the shelf. And yes, you're right, as we said earlier, we expect that to be a journey and whilst we expect to see sequential improvement in the first half of the year, we don't expect to return to positive growth and will the second half. Share is a holding in okay. Consumption is holding in okay. Dare to Love was repeated with Alibaba this year, but the important new news was Elmex. And that product started on team with Alibaba and it's up to over one share point. So, a reasonably good start for a slow-build therapeutic product. And we're quite pleased with that. And as Noel mentioned, we'll be going with an at-home whitening offering in China online the same way that happens to be a high-growth area as well in China. So, a lot of plans in place. And we are just going to have the have the patience to work through it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is actually [Indiscernible] on for Bill. Thanks for taking the question. Our question was just on the balance between volume and pricing, particularly, in emerging markets this coming year. I think we kind of understand that the volume drag was due to that pricing in the back half of this past year, but kind of working forward, any thoughts on the timing based on competitive pricing actions that be able to start to see volume growth in the emerging markets coming middle of this year, back half of this year, kind of, any color around that would be great? Thank you. Ian Cook : Yes, as you said we were pleased with the pricing that we have taken. And as you rightly say, there is always an impact on volume. So, as we think about it for next year, the plan we have is a balanced between pricing and volume. And it would be fair to say that the recovery of volume at least in the emerging markets as you say is spread across the year. Said from a big picture point of view, it is pricing-lead growth for the year, but there's a volume component. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Yeah, thanks, and good afternoon everybody. One quick follow-up and then just another question. On the China piece I was surprised pricing wasn't higher in Asia PAC given the degree of pricing that you're taking in China. So it sounds like maybe there's some timing some inventory work through still to come so that may explain it. But if you could you just help on that that would be great? And then secondly, just I wanted to know explore learnings from the professional skincare acquisitions from beginning of last year. And if you look at the numbers, it seems like they've actually been pretty successful obviously on a small base. But curious what learnings you've had from that? And whether you could take the professional skincare into -- or would take the professional skincare into retail skincare or other channels. Is that something potentially you'd look to focus on? And kind of related to that given all that we've heard today a lot going on so is that even something with a priority at this point? Ian Cook : Yes. Well thanks for the questions. Frankly, Mark, you answered your own first question. And that was what I was trying to imply by that these stocks are working through, so we are working the pricing to the consumer, but it is delayed as we work through the complicated inventory destocking. But I didn't know where you were going to go with the professional skincare business in terms of our learning. I think one thing we would say is that we obviously as Noel said expanding the portfolio in the geographies that we have which we think will continue to drive the strong growth of that business. The other thing I would comment at this stage in terms of the top line for North America you will remember that effective 2019 that PCA and Elta will now be incremental to the organic growth of North America which is a nice uptick for that business. As to the idea of retail, I think our thinking is we are likely to take the model and expand more products in the portfolio to other locations as a first step, but I wouldn't rule out retail at a point in time. But I don't think given all of the other things as you suggested we are focus on this year that 2019 would be the year that we would consider that. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning. Thanks very much. So, how much\u2026 Ian Cook : Hi, Jonathan. Jonathan Feeney : Hi. So, how much do you think a below average microenvironment if roughly the way to think about restrained emerging market growth in 2018 because in light of what at least look like similar FOREX and macro trends in 2009 or even 2015 when your own numbers were a little bit better? There's anyway you can share it or maybe parse what's secular from what's cyclical in emerging markets would be helpful? Thank you. Ian Cook : Well, I'm not a macroeconomist. So, what we tend to focus on is consumer behavior. Obviously, we -- the one where the lines crossed, if you will, was what we saw in Latin America with the lack of customary inflation which we think given the underlying commodity price pressures is beginning to come back. I guess the other conclusion we have grown is that Mexico seems to be six months ahead of Brazil. And while we stay very vigilant on Brazil, an optimistic view would see that perhaps follow the same curve. Beyond that, I wouldn't make any significant predictions. These are products that tend to be more fundamental usage products and we have enough bandwidth in our portfolio to scale down and scale up depending the way the market grows. And even in Brazil where the category has suffered, our market share has held up surprisingly well. Those are the only comments I think I'm informed enough to make. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, thank you. Ian my question is a follow-up on China. So, you sounded optimistic that the high-teens price increase in China is working its way there. But can you break down the performance between direct and indirect channels? Are the volumes still declining in both direct and indirect? And if inventory has normalized in the indirect channel? And also more like fundamental question about that could you also just explain a little bit more what's driving the indirect channel to be actively seeking out the lower price Colgate products considering the commentary about China generally premiumizing. So, any color on that would be helpful? Thank you. Ian Cook : Yes, interesting question Andrea. I think pricing generally moves to the direct trade more quickly than it does the indirect trade and we had made that point on the last call. And then when we talked about the destocking, I think, we laid out quite clearly the fact that the distribution go-to-market now has become enormously complicated in terms of the multiple ways people can buy a product whether it's a direct, whether it's indirect, whether it's online, whether it's offline. And that is what created the complication compounded by the fact you have less visibility with the indirect channel than you do with the direct channel. So, it is the indirect channel, but remember the indirect channel in China still goes to modern trade outlets, supermarkets. So, it's that that's going to have to work its way through. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Steve Strycula with UBS. Steven Strycula : Hi, good afternoon. Ian you referenced a few times in the call so far that two-thirds of the price increases have already been secured. So my question is, if you by chance do not secure the other third of the intended price increases where would that place within the spectrum of your 30 to 50 basis points of gross margin expansion this year? And then John for guardrail purposes, how do you think about operating profit dollar transfer the full year since EPS will be down mid-single digits? Thanks. Ian Cook : Yes. I'll speak for John. In terms of -- actually the point of making the comment on the pricing was to suggest confidence that we will indeed realize all of the pricing, given that more than two-thirds of it is already in place now. And given what we know is the first half headwind in terms of raw materials and foreign exchange and given what we see and hear from competitors operating in similar spaces. So unless you hear otherwise, our intention was to convey confidence in our ability to deliver the pricing. And in terms of operating profit as you know, we don't guide operating profit. We guide to the gross margin and the EPS. And to your point on gross margin, if we realize the pricing and our funding the growth ambitions of the year, we are comfortable with our 30 to 50 basis points guide on gross margin. So I believe those are all of the questions. I thank you for joining the call and we look forward to talking with you in April. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Please standby. Good day. And welcome to today\u2019s Colgate-Palmolive Company First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgate-palmolive.com. Now, for opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, sir. John Faucher : Thanks, Vickie. Good morning. And welcome to our first quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC including our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings all available on Colgate\u2019s website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Table 6 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Joining me this morning are Noel Wallace, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Henning Jakobsen, Chief Financial Officer. I will start off with a review of the quarter and our full year 2019 outlook. Noel will then provide a few quick thoughts before we open it up to Q&A. Our net sales declined 3% in Q1. We delivered 3% organic sales growth with 1% unit volume growth and 2% favorable pricing. This was offset by negative foreign exchange impact of 6%. We know that there is still work to do, but we are pleased with the further improvement in organic sales growth in the quarter, as we believe our strategies to reaccelerate growth are beginning to bear fruit. Importantly, the composition of the growth gives us comfort that we are returning to a more sustainable trajectory. On an organic basis, we delivered both volume and pricing growth for the first time in over two years, with volume and pricing growth in all four of our categories, Oral Care, Pet Nutrition, Personal Care and Home Care. We delivered geographically balanced organic sales growth with emerging markets and developed markets both up 3% and we delivered breadth in our organic sales growth with more than 75% of our hubs delivering organic sales growth in the quarter. Our focus on driving the core through innovation, attacking adjacent segments and expanding the availability of our brands in newer and higher growth channels and markets is beginning to pay off. Coupled with our increased brand support, we are optimistic that we can continue to deliver against the expectations for 2019 that we laid out on the fourth quarter earnings call. On a GAAP basis, our gross profit margin was down 130 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, it was down 110 basis points year-over-year. For the quarter, our 200 basis points of pricing provided a 70-basis-point benefit to gross margin. Raw materials costs, including foreign exchange transaction costs were a 320-basis-point drag on gross margin year-over-year. Our productivity programs led by our Funding the Growth initiatives provided a 150-basis-point benefit to gross margin. Other was a 10-basis-point drag. On an absolute basis, advertising investment was up 3% year-over-year. On a percent to sales basis, advertising was up 60 basis points year-over-year with increases on a percent to sale basis in every division. Excluding charges resulting from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program and advertising spending, our SG&A expenses were down year-over-year in the first quarter on an absolute basis and as a percent to sales, benefiting from our productivity programs. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share of $0.65 were down 10% year-over-year in Q1. Excluding charges resulting from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program diluted earnings per share were down 10% to $0.67. Our free cash flow in the quarter was $534 million, which was up 7% versus Q1 2018. Taking a look at the divisional results. North America delivered 3% net sales growth and 3.5% organic sales growth in the quarter, with 2% volume growth and 1.5% pricing growth. We saw strong sales growth in toothpaste in the quarter driven by Colgate Total SF, Colgate Optic White, Colgate Essentials and Tom\u2019s of Maine. Cloud and e-commerce delivered particularly strong toothpaste growth this quarter. The Colgate Total re-launch is proceeding in-line with our expectations, as Total\u2019s market share is up year-over-year since the launch. In the U.S., we took pricing through a downsizing, and this should lead to a shorter repurchase cycle, which should accelerate unit growth going forward as consumers come back more quickly. North America also benefited from the strong growth in the Elta MD and PCA Skin care businesses we acquired during Q1 of 2018. These brands are delivering very strong growth across a number of channels, including Professional, DTC and e-commerce. Europe\u2019s net sales were down 7% in Q1, driven by negative foreign exchange. Organic sales were up 0.5% in the quarter, as volume growth of 1.5% was mostly offset by negative pricing of 1%. While categories in Europe remain sluggish, our market shares were up or flat in seven of 10 categories. We delivered strong volume growth in Northern Europe with the U.K. and Scandinavia both up on the back of the Colgate Total re-launch. We have reintroduced Colgate Total in Scandinavia and it is driving strong incremental market share gains in that region. We also launched our meridol Pur in several markets in Europe in Q1, which brings our top therapeutic gum offering into the natural space at a premium price. In Personal Care, we continue to drive significant share gains behind the Sanex body wash business. In France, Sanex\u2019s body wash share is up more than 100 basis points year-to-date behind Sanex zero percent and the Sanex Physiologic brand. Latin America, we are pleased with our acceleration in organic sales growth in Latin America in Q1. Net sales declined 4.5% in the quarter, as 10.5% negative foreign exchange more than offset 2.5% volume growth and 3.5% pricing growth in the quarter. Importantly, the growth was broad-based as we delivered organic sales growth in every hub. We are particularly pleased with the sequential improvement we saw in Brazil in the quarter versus Q4 2018 as we delivered both pricing and volume growth. Encouragingly, category trends in Brazil do seem to be better although the market remains very promotional. Our recent innovations in Oral Care are paying off nicely as we are seeing market share gains for our Colgate Natural Extracts toothpaste line, our Colgate Guard franchise in pharmacies in Brazil, and the Colgate Slim Soft Advanced toothbrush. Net sales in Asia-Pacific were down 8%, driven by negative foreign exchange of 5.5%, a 2.5% decline in volume, and flat pricing. Our results in China remain challenged by the difficult steps we are taking to reorient our portfolio in an Oral Care category that is rapidly premiumizing and shifting into e-commerce. As we indicated in January, we still expect trends to improve in the second half of the year. Encouragingly, we saw strong growth in both volume and pricing in India, with growth coming on both, the Colgate MaxFresh and Colgate Vedshakti franchises. In order to drive penetration of Vedshakti, we recently gave away 30 million samples at the Ardh Kumbh Mela festival in India. Our Africa/Eurasia business showed solid underlying business momentum in Q1, despite the negative impact of foreign exchange. FX was a 13% drag on sales growth in the quarter, offsetting 7% pricing growth and flat volume. Our Eurasia hub delivered a strong mixture of pricing and volume growth in the quarter driven by Russia. Our North Africa, Middle East, Turkey hub also delivered volume growth in the quarter, despite significant pricing to offset foreign exchange. In order to help continue this momentum, we launched the full Meridol regimen, toothpaste, toothbrushes and mouth rinse in the pharmacy channel in Turkey in the first quarter. We also launched Palmolive Micellar Care shower gel in Russia this past quarter taking advantage of a big personal care trend. And finally, Hills, our strong growth at Hills continued in Q1. Growth was led by the United States with particularly strong growth in e-commerce, pet specialty, and farm and feed. Internationally, our growth was very broad-based, we delivered both volume and pricing growth in Canada, Europe, Australia, Asia and Latin America. As we discussed at CAGNY, Q1 marked the beginning of our re-launch of our Science Diet brand with the new packaging on-shelf as we speak. Initial response has been positive as Science Diet market share trends continue to increase year-over-year in Q1. The re-launch will continue across the globe through the first half of 2020. We have also significantly exceeded our subscription targets for our Hill's to home service which allows pet parents to realize the benefits of home delivery, while maintaining contact with the veterinarian. Moving on to full year guidance, we continue to expect net sales to be flat to up low-single digits. We continue to expect organic sales to be up to 2% to 4% based on current spot rates. For the full year we still expect gross margin to be up year-over-year on both, a GAAP basis and excluding charges related to our global growth and efficiency program. We expect the benefits of pricing and our productivity programs to offset an overall increase in raw material costs which includes the impact of transnational foreign exchange. We expect our advertising spending to be up notably, year-over-year on both, an absolute basis and as a percent of sales. We would expect advertising as a percent of sales for the full year to be fairly consistent with the Q1 level. We continue to expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be between 25.5% and 26.5%, both on a GAAP basis and excluding charges related to our Global Growth and Efficiency Program in 2019 and 2018, and the charge related to U.S. tax reform and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018. Based on current spot rates, we expect GAAP earnings per share to be down low-single digits for the year. Excluding the charges related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in 2019 and 2018, and the charge related to U.S. tax reform and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018, based on current spot rates we expect earnings per share to decline mid-single digits for the year. We would note that the consensus EPS estimate is in the middle of that range. And with that I will turn it over to Noel for his thoughts before the Q&A. Noel Wallace : Thanks, John and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. I thought it appropriate to begin by framing three strategic areas of focus for our company that I believe will be critical to our ongoing success, and we certainly started to see transpire in the first quarter. The first area of focus is how we are thinking about organic sales growth. No question that to deliver long-term revenue growth that's sustainable, we need to be more aggressive about going after growth, and we are going after growth differently. As you recall in the fourth quarter call and at CAGNY, I spoke about some of our growth mindset, specifically we are driving the Colgate brands like Total and Science Diet, remember these are big brands, big brands with a global penetration in many countries around the world, and we are bringing that to market through significant new innovation and superior product and formulations. We would also bringing that alongside significant brand building along those businesses with real brand purpose that resonates with consumers in the different way. Second, we are going after adjacent categories and product segments like naturals which is doing very well for us, therapeutics by expanding Elmex and Meridol to select markets, and importantly, expanding skincare and continuing to focus our investment on opening new doors and channels with that category. Third, we are expanding the availability of our products through distribution and new markets, being very thoughtful in that regard but we see opportunities in new channels, particularly in channels like e-commerce which is key to our continued growth moving forward. We were very pleased with the growth in e-commerce in the first quarter which was up 28% versus the year ago period. So, more to do and more to come and we are certainly focused on those areas. Our second key area of focus is to simplify our processes and our structures around the world. We recognize that we need to change in order to respond to a rapidly changing marketplace in terms of our ease and how consumers are shopping. For example, we have revamping our innovation process to dramatically reduce the time to market. You heard my dear fellows speak about that at CAGNY and those changes are underway beginning in Latin America, and we will begin to roll those out around the world as we move into the balance of the year. Third area of focus for us is using data and looking to digitize the organization very differently. We know that data can enable faster growth and faster decision-making. We know that data drives further ROI in media, and we know that data-driven marketing is far better return-on-investment than the way we are spending today. We also know that we can use data to improve our assortment in e-commerce. In the area of digitization some exciting thing is coming down the pipeline for us to drive productivity across the organization. We are going to change from our SAP system that we have had in - that we started in 1994 to the upgraded SAP S/4HANA which we think is going to simplify our processes significantly around the world, drive more standardization and better reporting and decision-making from all of that. So you begin to see a lot of this unfold as we move into the balance of the year. We are pleased to see some of that taking hold in the first quarter of this year. So, before I jump into Q&A I wanted to take a moment to thank the 35,000 Colgate people for supporting me during this important transition over the last year. I am extremely proud to lead, to listen and to learn from that extraordinary team, and I know with their drive and continued commitment, and our focus on growth, we will build a future to smile about. And it's those people that I want to extend a special thanks to Ian Cook for the past 12 years of his extraordinary leadership as CEO of this company. He has transformed this organization in many ways and we will be forever grateful for his leadership. I especially want to thank him for his wise counsel and mentorship over the last six months as he has prepared me for this new role. So with that let me turn it over to the questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question today from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Noel, I was curious if we could you talk a little bit about market shares. Just - you know, market shares in oral care have been an important metric for the business, like health of the business and so on, and like a badge of honor, frankly. And this quarter, topline certainly improved sequentially but shares are down versus I think where we talked about them at the end of January, both globally and in some key markets like Brazil, Mexico, India. So can you just talk a little bit about that, how you are thinking about market share in particular? When you would expect that to turn as you think about the path forward and some to the greater growth mindset you are putting in play? Noel Wallace : Overall, we have seen significant growth first of all, on untracked channels, particularly in U.S. where we saw double-digit growth in a lot of those untracked channels, which we are very encouraged about. If I stay within North America, the toothpaste shares are flat, we obviously introduce Colgate Total in the middle of February, we saw a significant competitive response and we have responded accordingly but we weren't going to deal overly aggressive in order to drive share. Bear in mind, that we are in this for the long-term, this is a marathon not a sprint with the launch of Colgate Total, it's not like introducing a new product, we have existing shelf space and existing penetration, it's a big brand and we are looking to continue the drive trial and repeat throughout the year. So the way we have structured and strategized our media spending over the year is to continue with high investments quarter-on-quarter through the balance of the year, and we think in the end that would generate sustained growth for the business. Moving on to some of the other markets, our value shares and volume shares in Mexico are actually flat, we are slightly down in Brazil and that was due to some aggressive promotion from the competitive environment, recognize that the Colgate Total launch which will have a significant premium in both those markets, which - where it has a sizeable share will launched in the second quarter. Our volume shares on balance are only down 30 basis points, so we feel quite comfortable with where we are, particularly, given the activity in most of the total spending coming in the year to go. Operator : We will take the next question from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : So, I had a question on your pricing in the quarter. I guess I am wondering why it slowed sequentially. And then I am also curious about this - for your emerging markets where I assume you would have been taking more pricing for FX. And then could you update us on your plan to any future pricing? Or essentially do you expect pricing to accelerate in the future or remain constant at current levels? Thanks. Noel Wallace : We were actually very pleased with the balance of organic growth in the first quarter, obviously both volume and pricing up, we had good pricing in the fourth quarter as you have pointed out, and likewise, good pricing in the first quarter, so coming off of that, we are quite pleased. Some of the pricing still yet to come, we talked about in the fourth quarter, the two-thirds would roll through from 2018 to 2019, we have a third to go, and we are quite confident that we will generate the pricing that we set out for ourselves on the year. Certainly at the current spot rates, if spot rates change, we certainly have to look to take more pricing but we are quite comfortable with where we are and how that's flowed through. Specifically on Total, we are very pleased from the fact that we have seen pricing stick everywhere we have launched Colgate Total. Coming back to the U.S., our equivalized shares - as John mentioned, we downsized, the price per ounce is up about 16% in the Total toothpaste franchise and the U.S. is up 8%, so price is holding and more to come as we move through the balance of the year. Operator : And the next question will come from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Just following up on China specifically, could you tell us exactly how much volumes were down in China? And I know you are going through a big repositioning of the brand and product assortment in that market but can you sort of give us some timing on that, when should we expect to see stronger numbers? Are there specific new products coming out or new advertising or anything like that? So, when do you think we turn positive in China? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. So China came in as we expected in the quarter, we had - I think communicated in the fourth quarter call that we expected China to turn in the back half and that's exactly the timing that we are still looking for. Some significant changes in investment going into China as we speak, we are looking at obviously to get the portfolio structured appropriately, we are getting the structure in the organization and putting resources where we think the growth will come in that business moving forward. So we are making some investments in the business in the short-term that we believe would drive sustainable growth in the long-term for our business which will be - we will start to see that turn in the back half of the year. Operator : And we will go to Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : So my question is on North America organic volumes, and a follow-up on the Colgate Total re-launch. So on North America, you called out on the prepared remarks that the benefit from EltaMD and PCA Skin now included in organic growth. Can you give us like, kind of a sort of magnitude - not a magnitude of that launch \u00fb not launch and the inclusion on the organic growth? And also on the Colgate Total re-launch, thinking about specifically, Latin America with Brazil in terms of the timing of the launch will all the volume of the re-launch be shipped during the second quarter? You had some of that done in the first quarter, so I am trying to see if there is any lumpiness on the volume as we progress through the quarters. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Thanks, Andrea. Again, a good growth in the first quarter out of North America, we are not going to break it out but suffice to say, all of the key elements of the North America business grew in the first quarter. We were particularly pleased with Tom's of Maine which had another significant growth following a sequential growth over the last three quarters, so that's doing well, the sell-in on Total performed well. Obviously as you have pointed out, PCA and Elta were added into the organic growth, not a significant portion, but we are very pleased with the progress on that business that we have seen thus far. So overall, a good performance in North America across a well balanced organic growth in all of their categories and their core businesses. In terms of the re-launch of our Colgate Total in Latin America, we just started shipping at the end of the first quarter with most of the activity and all of the investment to come in the second quarter. So I would say a portion in the first, most to come in the second as we move forward. Operator : We will go to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : I am just trying to contextualize some of the discussions so far in the quarterly results in a little bit more broad, and you have done that a couple of times but I want to continue on that theme. The big debate I think is, are you spending enough, that's the one I hear the most. And so, if you look at the quarter's results, you could argue that they are consistent with that concerning narrative, right, we are not spending enough to turn the ship. The sequential pricing, i.e. probably more create spend, more promo this quarter to get more shelf space, there was clearly a lot of the inventory load, right, so that pricing that you guys talked about on Colgate Total, for example, in North America, a lot of inventory loaded in Elmex and others. AMP was up, maybe not quite as much as I thought it might be but it's up which I guess is good. But all this activity so far, and we still see those market share issues in the U.S. and in Mexico, Brazil, Russia, India, China, I mean U.K. looks little bit better but still some pressure - and by the way, do you wonder in the U.S. what the sell-out was versus the sell-in - so it doesn't look great on the tracked channels. So, I guess I am just trying to get underneath this idea of - should we just be more patient to see those terms? I think that's your messaging, but should we just be more patient to see this upturn? And so you are 100% confident that you are actually spending enough? And so this concern about another rebase to happen around the corner or not spending enough that view is just so far what you are seeing going to be wrong. Noel Wallace : Thanks, Ali. A lot in that question. So let me try to step back for a moment, talk a little bit about our strategy. We realized to drive long-term sustainable growth that we do things very thoughtfully and in a measured way. We have taken the advertising up, as you well pointed out, quite significantly in our view, up in the first quarter, we will hold those levels through the balance of the year and everything that we know about building brands, particularly brands as big and as scalable as Colgate Total, it's that continuity that really pays off in the long run. We don't look to a percent to sales, we look for what do we need to do to create the right impressions and the right engagement behind a significant innovation like Colgate Total, and that's exactly what we are doing. We are going to continue to plot away with the plan that we have, we were very strategic in not making - and not necessarily spending all of our money in the first quarter, we want to balance out over the year, we are not buying shelf space, I heard you mention that. And a brand like Colgate Total, which is an existing brand in the U.S. at 10-share, that's a successful brand already. So what we are doing is basically trying to drive more velocity off-the-shelf, we are not necessarily increasing shelf and we didn't necessarily see any of that in terms of shelf increases in the first quarter. So we have got strong shares, strong shelf space, and we are going to continue to build on that. I will give you a little bit about consumption on Colgate Total. Obviously, as we move through some of the high competitive reactions in February and March, the last four weeks on Colgate Total, the consumption is up 40% and our share is up 1 point. So we are in a good position relative to what we are seeing there and obviously a lot of the work to come as we move through the balance of the year. And in terms of advertising, we will likewise see those increases come to bear as we roll it out, particularly, in big markets like Latin America. Operator : And the next question is from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : So as you talked about in the open, you are arguably managing a larger number of growth priorities today versus history. And I guess what - I am wondering as we you can talk more about how you are prioritizing them relative to one other. I am sure the first order of business is ensuring the Colgate - the core Colgate Oral Care franchise returns to market-leading growth, but around that, as you talked about, you got the expansion into naturals, you are broadening the reach of brands like Elmex, investing in e-commerce, stepping up support for professional skincare, and obviously driving Hill's as well. And - obviously, not all of those initiatives are mutually exclusive but again, how are you thinking about allocating relative investment dollars to each of them? If you had an extra dollar, which bucket are you most likely to add to? And any thoughts if you can do it all organically or are you increasingly opened to M&A in support of those initiatives? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Thanks, Steve. So let me go back to a little bit about - with regards to my upfront comments around how we are framing growth. As I talked about at CAGNY, we are really looking at three specific priorities and in many respects that would kind of prioritize how we are spending, that will unfold through the balance of the year. Historically, we were very focused on line extensions and to a certain extent growing in the adjacencies, and we quickly recognized that we have to have a real balance. Colgate has big core businesses that are in many countries around the world that had significant leakage relative to share and were not driving the growth that we needed, hence our need to put real superior bundles behind the core in order to shore up the core, so when we balance that with increased innovation behind adjacencies like naturals, like therapeutics, that we get the incremental growth moving forward and that's exactly how we are going to prioritize it. Relative to M&A, certainly there is a lot of activity out there, we are still going to be extremely thoughtful on how we approach M&A. We have obviously done some great M&A over the last couple of years, specifically PCA and Elta which we are very excited about, as those assets become available we will think through them very carefully relative to their strategic fit in the business and what they bring, and if we find the right value we will certainly go after them. Operator : And we will go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Thanks, good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about the balance. You talked a lot about the balance between developed markets versus emerging market performance, volume versus price, so as you progress through the year how do you think about that because I would assume that there, you talked about some of the pricing that you are planning to do in some of the markets, you know, a third of it still hasn't rolled through so I would assume that price becomes a bigger component of that. Do you think that volume then sort of turns a little bit and just your overview on the balance between all those different factors? Noel Wallace : Sure. I think at the heart of a lot of that good balance this year, particularly between emerging and the developed world was the fact that we are starting to see some of the categories turn in the emerging markets which is particularly encouraging for us given our footprint. So moving forward, we would continue to see that balance of pricing and volume moving through the balance of the year. The innovation will support the volume that the innovation will support the premiumization that we are going after, particularly as we see total and the Science Diet business, which is just now going into the U.S. and the roll out through the balance of the year start to take hold. So we will continue to see the right balance as we move forward keeping the investment there will help drive that. Operator : Next is Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. Good morning. Noel Wallace : Hi, Kevin. Kevin Grundy : So, Noel, my question is on industry growth rates relative to your organic sales growth guidance at 2% to 4%. So at this point where would you peg industry growth in Total as you roll up your business and your geographies relative to the 3% organic growth in the quarter? How has that changed if at all since 4Q, you sound more upbeat on emerging markets, which is obviously a good thing. And then, for us, is it fair that we should expect an acceleration in your organic sales growth over the next couple of quarters as year-over-year comps seasons more spending goes into the marketplace and it seems like the emerging markets are in a better place? So thank you for that. Noel Wallace : Sure. The categories as you mentioned, we have seen a tick-up particularly in emerging. We are modeling organic, excuse me, we are modeling category growth rates in that 3% to 5.5% depending on the market around the world. In the developed world, somewhere between flat to around 2.5%, we seen a little bit of tick-up in the U.S., Europe continues to move sideways, but the U.S. we are seeing a little bit of acceleration there. So we think we are relative to our guidance on the 2% to 4%. We are well-positioned where the categories are and if Latin America and particularly Africa continued to accelerate or hold at the current levels that would bode well for us. But we said that before, let\u2019s get a couple more quarters underneath us relative to those categories and we will go from there. Operator : We will now go to Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Thanks. Good morning. Noel Wallace : Hey, Bill. Bill Chappell : Noel, first a clarification you had said to Bonnie\u2019s question you came into the year two-thirds of pricing and still a third to go. Are we still a third to go or did you do a fair amount during first quarter? And then, the second just on Hill\u2019s, can you give us a little more color on the strength and maybe from a market share perspective we don\u2019t get to see so much of the channels are untracked it\u2019s kind of hard to understand exactly where you are getting it. Is it from emphasis from the specialty channel coming back or is it just the vet channel is doing well or just help us give more color why it\u2019s doing better? Noel Wallace : Sure. Well, let me take the pricing question first. Yeah, we are about right. We are right where we thought we would be about two-thirds of the business. We are seeing a roll through and a third to go and we have got some pricing that\u2019s going into place starting the second quarter. So we are quite comfortable with that in terms of how that\u2019s going to roll through the balance of the quarters in \u201819. Hill\u2019s is a great story. I come back to a lot of the fundamentals of our strategy, which is driving the core working on adjacencies and particularly expanding into new segments and new retail environments, and Hill\u2019s ticks those boxes extraordinarily well. We obviously had great growth in the fourth quarter, really strong start to the year, relative to what we are seeing Science Diet re-launch and just now going into the market as I mentioned in terms of the full impact of the new packaging and the new formulations, which as I mentioned at CAGNY will be coupled with increased pricing and the media investment behind that business particularly in North America will now start to go into the market in the second quarter. U.S. had a very strong first quarter, and, again, I think it\u2019s driven by great market share gains particularly in pet specialty. We obviously continue to have a very strong e-commerce business and holding shares there and we -- in terms of expanding into new channels, we have gone aggressively the farm and feed channel, which was growing and we were under indexed and we have seen incremental distribution and sales growth come from that. So, all-in-all, really pleased with where Hill\u2019s is right now and particularly pleased given a lot of the Science Diet stuff is still to come in the U.S. and we will start to roll that out in the balance of the world as we move into the second half. Operator : We will go to Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much and nice start to the year. Noel Wallace : Thanks, Robert. Robert Ottenstein : Wondering if we could drill down a little bit more into what\u2019s going on in Brazil and so a couple of sub points, perhaps, if you can talk a little bit more about the competitive situation you mentioned still very tough promo environment. Is there any visibility on that changing and how do you expect to deal with that? Second, the rollout of the therapeutics, elmex, meridol in Brazil. How that\u2019s going? Do you need more investment there? Is it going to be kind of self-funding at this point, and I guess tied to that, how you are doing in the pharmacy channel? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Great. Thanks, Robert. So again good results coming out of Brazil. We were pleased particularly given that we generated both volume and pricing in Brazil in the quarter, which was terrific to see. Relative to the promotion environment yeah we saw some of our competitors go quite aggressive in the first quarter. We decided not to chase that with our business. It was interesting the share loss that we saw in the first quarter, which is roughly about 1 point on the business. We are still at a 72 share, came out [inaudible], our Sorriso brand, which is our secondary brand because of the deep discount and we saw some from our competitors. That being said our instinct is that that particularly be driven by a high promotional activity that we always see in the first quarter do we often not chase given some of the foreign exchange headwinds that we have seen in that market and we think that will balance itself out through the remainder of the year. Early days on elmex. We have rolled it into the pharmacy channel. The pharmacy channel is roughly 15% to 20% of the ACV in Brazil. Early news is really good on elmex in terms of driving incremental share in the pharmacy channel we are up about a point so far in the channel but lots more to go. The investments there we ring fenced it it\u2019s an important strategic initiative for us and we are optimistic that we will continue to see particularly that channel grow as you move through the balance of the year. Operator : Next is Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking my question. Noel Wallace : Hey, Jason. Jason English : Sticking on the topic of going a little bit deeper and into the markets. Can you take us a little bit deeper into China, give us a beat on where you think the consumption is tracking and whether or not your net sales are still lagging on inventory reduction or whether or not that\u2019s been flushed out? And then a second and sorry for following on, thinking about your gross margin trajectory for the year, cost inflation headwinds stepped down fairly sizable 4Q to 1Q. How should we expect that to trend through the remainder of the year? Noel Wallace : Thanks, Jason. So quickly coming back to China. Not a lot more to add there. We are obviously it came in in-line with our expectations. The inventory de-stocking continues. We made good progress in the fourth quarter, continued progress in the first. We are rebalancing, as I mentioned some of our go-to-market structures and how we take the product to market, particularly as it results around the portfolio specifically, and that will unfold as we move through the balance of the year. So as I said we expect to see sequential improvement moving through the back half of the year and that is on schedule as we speak. Relative to gross margin, so your question around cost, yeah, we saw significant elevation of cost in the fourth quarter, a little bit better in the first quarter, in the range of 4% to 6% commodity in terms of increases moving through the gross profit line and we expect that to abate as we move through and lapse some of the foreign exchange transaction impact that we had last year that occurred in the first half and will get better as we move through the balance of the year. So the answer to your question is, yes, we expect that to abate, which has given us confidence that we can continue to hold and increase gross margins moving forward. Operator : We will go to Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hey. Good morning, guys. Noel, you mentioned e-commerce in various parts of your prepared remarks. Can you perhaps provide us a little more context what your share looks like online versus elsewhere maybe what your margins look like online versus elsewhere? And then, I think, you said, e-commerce was up 28%, are you able to give some context on how much that contributed to organic growth? Noel Wallace : Sure. So, listen, first of all, we are very pleased. Again, coming back to those growth strategies that I outlined earlier, expanding in new retail environments and getting our fair share so to speak is a real strategic focus for us. And e-commerce is an important area of that. As I mentioned, we were up just shy of 29% in the first quarter, and importantly, that was driven with a strong North America performance. Their shares were up 1.7 points on the Colgate franchise alone, which was terrific and likewise driven by a continued strong growth on the Hill\u2019s business. The softness we have is to a certain extent in Asia, while the e-commerce shares are flat we didn\u2019t see the growth that we are expecting there and that\u2019s part of the turnaround strategy that we are looking to execute as we move through the back half of this year. Operator : Next is Steven Strycula with UBS. Steven Strycula : Hi. Good morning and congratulations on the new seat. Noel Wallace : Thanks, Steve. Steven Strycula : So, Noel, my question is as you look across the portfolio after the work you guys have done the last few years, which three countries and category combinations do you think are the biggest revenue and profit dollar opportunity for an incrementality standpoint as we look forward the next few years? And the quick second part of that would be, is there any reason you guys haven\u2019t given anymore defined parameter around your gross margin outlook for the year relative to what you did last quarter? Thanks. Noel Wallace : So listen on the categories we love all our children equally in this case, obviously, Oral Care continues to be a real focus for us. The first quarter organic that we delivered was largely driven by toothpaste and by Hill\u2019s, and so we are very encouraged. But as John mentioned in his opening remarks, we had positive organic across all the categories which in our view is the quality and the composition that we are ultimately looking for. But from a prioritization, certainly, Oral Care, Personal Care, and our Pet Food have always been our top three priorities and we will continue to focus on growth in that regard. In terms of your second question, it was around gross margins. Listen, we -- as I have mentioned not much more to add. We expect gross margins to be up on the year. We expect some of the cost environment that we saw in the fourth quarter and the first quarter to abate as we move through the balance of the year. We have got more pricing to come and we obviously have the Total re-launch and Science Diet re-launch rolling out around the world. So we are comfortable with where we are now at the current spot rates and we will see how that unfolds, but comfortable in terms of the outlook that we have given. Operator : And we will go to Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Thanks, and good morning, everybody. Wanted to ask about specific learning from PCA and Elta. And I am curious do you think you can take those brands into other channels. How do you think about differences of selling into specific specialty type channels, Doctors\u2019 offices and the like versus mass or other channels, and perhaps indulge me kind of to take it a step further what gives confidence that you can have success in skincare more broadly just given competitive dynamics in the market and I am kind of alluding to your comment about expanding on skincare going forward? Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Let me step back for a minute and give you a little bit of insight in terms of how we look at M&A. Not just simply from the economics and the growth aspects of those categories or businesses that we acquire. But more importantly what are the core competencies and learning that they can bring into the larger enterprise across the company, and Elta and PCA fit those parameters just perfectly. Obviously, we love business with strong endorsement levels. Elta at the dermatology level and PCA at the aesthetician level and we have learned from what we have done obviously at Oral Care and our Vet business on how to successfully monetize that going forward. Both those businesses have unique aspects to them. Elta has an incredible e-commerce business, and an influencer model, particularly as they have digital very effectively. Likewise, PCA has a wonderful in-office strategy in terms of how they go-to-market there, particularly around their data driven marketing that they use. So some great insights that we will bring into the business and certainly leverage across other categories and we continue to dial up the investment in those businesses given the great growth that we are seeing coming out of them at least initially in the first quarter. Moving forward, Skincare is interesting to us. We have got two businesses that we are focused on right now. We will continue to drive those moving forward. If we see other things come available that we think we are interested in and will bring real value to the Colgate Company, we will certainly go after those. But we are very focused on what we have right now and that\u2019s how we are going to lay it out for the balance of the year. Noel Wallace : So, again, let me extend my thanks to the entire Colgate team, obviously, a good quarter that we should be proud of. We all know there\u2019s a lot of work to do. We are very focused on growth and let\u2019s get after it. We are in the second quarter as they say and we will be in touch with everyone on the call as we move through the balance of the quarter and into the third quarter. Thanks so much. Operator : And thank you very much. That does conclude our call for today. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to today\u2019s Colgate-Palmolive Company Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgate-palmolive.com. Now, for opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John. John Faucher : Thanks Ebony. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC including our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings all available on Colgate\u2019s website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in table 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Joining me this morning are Noel Wallace, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Henning Jakobsen, Chief Financial Officer. I will start off with some thoughts on our progress halfway through the year. I'll then provide some details on Q2 and our full year outlook. I will then turn it over to Noel for his thoughts and he'll open it up for your questions. Halfway through 2019, we\u2019re pleased but not satisfied with the acceleration in organic sales growth. As Noel discussed earlier in the year, delivering on our organic sales growth target is our number one priority for 2019. We continue to focus on executing against three key areas to accelerate growth : using innovation to drive the core, pushing into adjacent higher growth segments and expanding our availability in faster growth channels. These strategies have helped us to deliver broad-based improvement in organic sales growth over the past few quarters with a healthy balance between price and volume growth. For both the first and second quarters we've delivered organic sales growth across all four product categories : Oral Care, Personal Care, Home Care and Pet Nutrition and in both developed and emerging markets. Our first area of focus is driving the core through innovation like Colgate Total and Hill's Science Diet re-launches. We\u2019ve seen Colgate Total's global market share improved sequentially since the re-launch and we're seeing significant increases in pricing across key markets. For Science Diet we\u2019re seeing share gains in brick and mortar, as well as in e-commerce in the U.S. We\u2019re just at the beginning of the international rollout of this re-launch and the initial retailer response has been positive. Secondly, we are pushing into adjacent higher-growth segments like Naturals and Therapeutics. We are very pleased with the progress that our Charcoal launches are making around the world and we continue to expand elmex and meridol to new markets. Our third focus is to expand the availability of our products around the world by focusing on faster growth channels like e-commerce and discounters which are driving much of the category growth. Our U.S. e-commerce business continues to deliver growth well in excess of the category driving significant toothpaste market share gains in the second quarter and year-to-date. Next we're pleased to share progress in gross margin expansion in the second quarter as our gross margin was up for the first time in five quarters. Our focus on delivering pricing through premiumization and revenue growth management is paying off both in terms of organic sales growth and at the gross margin line, and our funding the growth initiatives are having a strong year so far. We are also very excited about the transaction we announced two weeks ago. We\u2019ve spoken over the past few years about our focus on skin health. The completion of our acquisition of the Laboratoires Filorga Cosm\u00e9tiques Skin Care business will provide us with a high margin, very high-growth brand with a focus on the anti-ageing segment. Filorga had net sales of approximately $250 million for the latest 12 months ending June 2019. The business is also nicely profitable as it has growth in operating margins that are above our overall Personal Care margins. As we said in the press release announcing the transaction, we expect no impact to EPS this year from Filorga, that excludes $0.01 of transaction costs. We expect roughly $0.01 of earnings accretion in 2020. We plan to finance the acquisition with a combination of cash and debt. In order to pay down the additional debt more quickly, we intend to reduce our share repurchase activity after the close of the transaction. We expect this will reduce our 2019 growth share repurchase by around 10% from last year's total of $1.24 billion. Finally, we made some real progress on enhancing our leadership on sustainability. As part of our 2025 target to make all of our packaging recyclable, we received the first-ever approval for recyclable toothpaste tube in The United States from the Association of plastic recyclers. This is a big step in our sustainability journey. Moving to our Q2 results. Our net sales declined 0.5% in the second quarter. We delivered 4% organic sales growth with 1% unit volume growth and 3% favorable pricing. This was more than offset by negative foreign exchange impact of 4.5%. On a GAAP basis, our gross margin was up 50 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, it was up 30 basis points year-over-year. Pricing was a positive 100 basis point impact to gross margin in the second quarter, while strong productivity performance drove a 220 basis point benefit. This was mostly offset by a minus 300 basis point drag from raw materials inflation, which includes foreign exchange transaction cost and other was favorable by 10 basis points. On an absolute basis, advertising investment was up 3% year-over-year. On a percent of sales basis advertising was up 40 basis points year-over-year with increases on a percent of sales basis in every division. We still expect the greater increase in advertising spending on both an absolute basis and as a percent of sales in the second half of the year. Excluding charges resulting from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program and advertising spending, our SG&A expenses were up year-over-year in the second quarter on an absolute basis and as a percent of sales. As higher compensation, logistics costs and the cycling of some one time benefits in the year-ago period more than offset savings from our productivity programs. On a GAAP basis diluting earnings per share of $0.68 were down 7% year-over-year in Q2. Excluding charges resulting from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program in 2019 and 2018 and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018 diluted earnings per share were down 6% to $0.72. Our free cash flow through the first half was $1.1 billion which was up 2% versus prior year. Now taking a quick look at the divisions. North America net sales grew 2.5% in the quarter as 2% volume growth and 1% pricing growth were partially offset by minus 0.5% foreign exchange. North America Oral Care growth was led by our toothpaste business where the Colgate Total relaunch help drive significant positive pricing. Our Personal Care growth was led by our PCA Skin and Elta MD professional skin care businesses, which continued to deliver a very strong growth. On the Home Care business Fabuloso continued its strong performance reaching its highest ever market share in the US. Europe posted a 5% decline in net sales with organic sales up 1% and foreign exchange minus 6%. We\u2019re seeing sequential market share implement following the Colgate Total relaunch in key markets like the UK, Spain and Italy. On the Personal Care side, our Sanex physiological line, which brings pharmacy trends into mass channels, is driving incremental share and body cleansing. Latin America net sales were down 0.5% as 1.5% volume and 5.5% pricing were offset by 7.5% negative foreign exchange. For the second quarter in a row, we saw organic sales growth in every hub, including Mexico and Brazil. The underlying category growth rates in Latin America remain modestly positive, which is an improvement versus 2018. Our focus on premiumizing our portfolio through the Colgate Total relaunch, additional Oral Care and Personal Care premium innovation and revenue growth management, drove the strong pricing growth across the division. Net sales in Asia Pacific were down 4%, driven by negative foreign exchange of 3%, a 1.5% decline in volume and positive pricing of 0.5%. We showed improvement in organic sales growth in the quarter, led by better pricing growth. As expected, China remained drag on our results, with all of the other hubs showing organic sales growth. We\u2019re encouraged by the performance of the natural toothpaste brands in India and Thailand, while our South Pacific business benefited from strong pricing for the Colgate Total relaunch. Our results in China improved sequentially in the quarter, but remained negative, as we continue to focus on optimizing our distribution network. As we indicated last quarter, we expect more significant improvement in the second half of the year. The Africa, Eurasia division delivered robust underlying performance in the quarter, with net sales up 0.5%, volume plus 3.5%, pricing up 6% and foreign exchange of minus 9%. The division delivered organic sales growth across every hub, driven by strong pricing. Significant investment in advertising spending over the past few years is paying off in improved growth across the division. Our Eurasia hub continued its improved performance, led by Russia, with solid volume and pricing growth, aided by the Colgate Total re-launch. Our strong volume and pricing performance in Turkey allowed the Colgate brand to achieve all-time highs in market share and establish market share leadership. Our Sub-Saharan Africa business also delivered a nice combination of volume and pricing growth in the quarter. Hill's continued to deliver in Q2, with net sales growth of 3.5%, volume growth of 2% and pricing growth of 4%, were partially offset by negative foreign exchange of minus 2.5%. The turnaround at Hill's over the last 2 years shows that a combination of increased marketing support and strong innovation, behind a compelling brand purpose narrative, can drive growth. While growth was led by North America, every hub delivered positive pricing and every hub, but one, delivered volume growth in the quarter. The international results are encouraging, since they do not yet reflect any impact from the Science Diet re-launch outside of North America. Europe grew both volume and pricing in the quarter, behind our new Prescription Diet Stews business and e-commerce growth. Moving on to full year guidance, which excludes the impact of the Florida transaction. We continue to expect net sales to be flat to up low single digits and organic sales to be up 2% to 4%. Given our performance year-to-date, we would expect organic sales to be towards the higher end of that 2% to 4% range. Based on current spot rates for the full year, we still expect gross margin to be up year-over-year on both a GAAP basis and excluding charges related to our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. We expect the benefits of pricing and our productivity programs to offset an overall increase in raw material costs which include foreign exchange transaction cost. We would expect advertising as a percent of sales for the full year to be fairly consistent with the first half level. We now expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be between 25% and 26% both on a GAAP basis and excluding charges related to our Global Growth and Efficiency Program in 2019 and 2018 and the charge related to U.S. tax reform and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018. Our previous guidance was for 25.5% to 26.5%.  Based on current spot rates, we expect GAAP earnings per share to be down low single digits for the year. Excluding charges related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in 2019 and 2018 and the charge related to U.S. tax reform and the benefit from a foreign tax matter in 2018 based on current spot rates, we expect earnings per share to decline mid-single digits for the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Noel. Noel Wallace : Great. Thanks John and good morning everyone. I thought I'd open up with a few thoughts before we jump into the Q&A. Solid quarter to be sure. We're pleased with the broad-based acceleration in organic sales growth, particularly for geographic and category level and more sharply around emerging markets as we've continued to focus on accelerating that part of the world. As we\u2019ve said in the past and you've heard me talk about we're really trying to drive faster growth differently and that really begins with a clear understanding of our categories, clear understanding of our consumers in our retail environments and how they are changing and how it shapes our efforts, how it allocates our investments differently, how we decide to innovate differently against those changes and informs the investment choices that we make so far through the first half of the year and moving through the back of the year as well. Happily, you are seeing us pay off to our increased investments in our focus on driving the core through to better utilization as John mentioned. We\u2019re very selective on the adjacent segments that we're going after, Naturals particularly is important; the Premium Therapeutic is an area of opportunity for us; and most recently the focus that we have on Skin Health behind Elta PCA and soon as we integrate the Filorga acquisition that we recently announced. Lastly on the channel acceleration and specifically our go to market approach and we're going after e-commerce where we've seen significant acceleration in the first half of the year as well as in pharmacy and discount stores. Now while the shares in track channels are not where they -- where we like them to be, the first step is obviously accelerating growth across our business on a broad-based perspective and you're going to start to see the shares improve in the back half, but first we need to get the top line moving. And as you well know generating significant share growth and organic growth in non-track channels which is obviously not picked up in the share results that you're looking at. But we know we need to drive profitable growth and to do that we need to change how we think about driving productivity across the organization as well. Of course, we remain focused on those traditional efforts that we've done so well. Our focus on finding the cost which is off to a great start in the first half of the year in particular an accelerated in the second half of the quarter. The due jab which is come to end in the balance of this year, but we are well focused on fully maximizing that as we move through the next six months of the year. And our productivity lens really needs to move beyond just the cost-cutting efforts. We need to think about productivity, and how we really maximize and fully realize the capacity of all the Colgate people around the Colgate world. And to do that, we need to change how we work : eliminating and streamlining processes getting to quicker decisions through the use of data and analytics, using technology across the enterprise to support our business more effectively. You heard me talk about a little bit in the past on SAP, and how we're \u2013 now upgrading S/4HANA and we're now looking to build global capabilities once again that will make us far more productive with a single global standard far more simplified and automated system, to allow us to get their decisions quicker, and allow us to find efficiency faster. All of these changes were importantly free up capacity of Colgate people to drive growth and do that on a more sustainable basis moving forward. So excited about the progress we're making, but as I said earlier, more work to do. With that, I'll turn it over to you for the Q&A please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hi. Good morning, guys. Noel Wallace : Hey, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So this is now your third skin care deal in the last couple of years here in the segment for a company that generally has been pretty to judicious with M&A in the past. And you mentioned skin care expansion is a priority last quarter. So I was just hoping, if you could give us a better state of the union around your interest in skin care, is gaining a lot more scale in the segment of priority as you look out over the next 5 to 10 years? And just help us better understand the strategy to succeed in the segment from a Colgate perspective particularly relative to some of the larger established competitors that seemingly you are spending a lot of money and effort already in this segment? What gives you the confidence that Colgate can prosper in Skin Care? Thanks. Noel Wallace : All right, Dara. Thanks. Obviously, we're - let's start off with Elta and PCA which we talked about know a couple of times. We love the capabilities they're bringing to the organization, but underscoring that is the category itself. I mean, Skin Care is a significant category. It's growing at a cliff of about 5% to 6% globally. We know, it's highly margin accretive to us and we feel like the spaces that we are very thoughtfully selected to participate in are spaces that we can do well. So we talked about Elta particularly as we relate to the fact that they're very derm recommended and the capabilities and that we can bring to that on PCA statistician driven and the endorsements that we can continue to drive there. And more recently with Filorga, obviously they are very strong in the pharmacy channel, which we think we can obviously bring significant value to. We\u2019re being selective on the space as we go into, but continue to be very judicious on the acquisition front. These things kind of happen in stream so to speak and we're obviously building out a very strong skin care portfolio, but will continue to be very, very mindful moving forward, and how we continue to build that. If I look at Filorga very specifically, we really love the brand. It's positioned extraordinarily well demographically, when you look around the world. 90% of its business is in anti-ageing and certainly the demographic trends that we see both here in North America and all around the world bode well for that business moving forward. Antiaging within the Skin Care segment is the fastest-growing sub-segment within Skin Care. It's highly profitable to the business and accretive on a gross margin basis. Importantly, they got a really well-balanced management team with significant experience in Skin Care that we think will add real value to us. And as I mentioned earlier, we like the profile of the channels, particularly the pharmacy growth where their premium price within pharmacy, which we think will add a lot of value to our pharmacy business around the world and they've got new expansion opportunities and emerging channels in the world. And last, I'd say geographically, obviously strengthen in Europe, but more importantly emerging strength in Asia, and particularly China. So those are the reasons, we like Skin Care. We\u2019re going to be continued to answer your question to be very judicious and thoughtful about M&A. We feel we got really good one here and it's going to round out the Skin Care portfolio quite nicely. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Andrea Teixeira, JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. Noel Wallace : Good morning. Andrea Teixeira : Good morning. So can you please elaborate a little bit more on the funding for growth. I think you came in well in the gross margin level. And usually it's back loaded in the balance of the year. So my question is, if we should be seeing that probably slightly ahead of expectation and that funding bit of your overhead expenses on that one if you can tell us, I think its part of your SG&A came in a little stronger, because you're investing in these emerging channels that you just described for Skin Care? r is there anything that may have been heavier in the quarter? And if we have time - if I can just squeeze in China if you could update us on the changes there and the distribution that'll be great? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Thanks, Andrea. So let me quickly go through the margin forward which I think you heard John take you through. But in summary, we\u2019re obviously pleased with the pricing that we generate in the quarter up one point and funding the growth as you mentioned a little bit outpacing where we where at this time last year. And I think that's a result of more sharpened focused on the cost lines, specifically moving to the first half of this year. And that bodes well obviously for the back of this year, particularly as we see hopefully lower transaction costs are coming through the P&L given we\u2019re lapping some of the significant deval that we had in the second half of last year, material prices were up about 300 basis points, so those are obviously offset with the strong pricing and a strong funding growth that we had. So the outlook for the balance as John mentioned that, we expect to see our gross margin is up and we'll continue to be very sharply focused on funding the growth. And I think the efforts that we have around revenue growth management and premiumization of our bundles, particularly around the core bode well for the back of the year. On the SG&A line, the biggest impact on SG&A in the quarter were result of the following : higher logistics cost, which we've seen as you know creeping into the P&L over the last six to nine months, a swinging compensation this year versus last year, where obviously the results were weaker in the quarter, and last year we had some one-time benefits that we're now lapping through the P&L. Looking ahead, we obviously do not feel we got an issue of cost at SG&A line. We're very focused on maximizing the GGEP programs through the last six months of the year. More importantly, setting up some of the significant changes we've made around the company both structurally and operationally to ensure that they continues to yield savings for us as we move into 2020. The other element of that is looking at what we're going to do with S/4HANA, as I mentioned upfront significant structural change for us over the next 18 months, where we anticipate that will generate significant savings for us as we look to standardize, processes and systems around the world and find ways to drive more agility to the systems. So, all in all, we think we're in a good place. The growth in SG&A was more one time. We think, we feel we got good control of that moving forward. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Hey, great. Thanks. Good morning all. So, as John highlighted, you've been hard at regaining traction in Asia and China specifically over the past several quarters. And it sounds like, you still feel optimistic about those efforts beginning to take greater hold in the second half. But can you maybe help frame your expectations for us in a bit more detail, just in terms of what success would look like over the balance of the year in that region for you? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. It\u2019s progress specifically. Obviously, we've seen progress sequentially in the quarter from first or second. Asia came in slightly ahead of plan, but not enough to change the outlook that we have guided for the back of the year. Importantly, on Asia, all hubs were up very nicely in the quarter outside of China. And China was sequentially up in the quarter. And so, as we've guided before, we anticipated that we'll continue to see that improvement through the back half of this year. And that's the plan that we're executing as we speak. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Ali Dibadj : Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess, I'm probably just trying to understand whether you think you're hitting the right balance investments versus topline and bottom line delivery. You guys see it much more granularity, but kind of from the outside -- certainly looks like SG&A expenses were up 195 basis points you just said that short term. We could tell A&P was only up about 40 basis points on a percent of sales year-on-year which is below what we had thought and certainly below we thought for the year. And then meanwhile, you mentioned the global toothpaste share was down 40 basis points year-on-year, manual toothpaste share was down 40 basis points year-on-year become to continues to loose share in North America, I guess the U.S.; Mexico; Brazil; Russia; India; China. And to be clear, this is not tracked or untracked out of. This is just by our numbers in the release. And then, you're getting to the EPS by better taxes, lowering the increase in A&P for the year and now seeing you're in a curtailed buybacks by 10% for these acquisitions in Skin care. So it's - you put this mosaic together and I guess I'm struggling to see the clear vector that suggests that you're getting the right balance in terms of investment for the long term. So, or do you need to make more dramatic actions on cost savings or spend back or something else. So, I'm just trying to get a sense of which of those mosaic pieces I should overemphasize versus are underemphasize to feel comfortable that the balance in investments is the right one? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Thanks, Ali. So let's start with the story that we've been communicating externally which is that is to get an acceleration of topline growth back into the P&L. And the investment strategy to do that as you've seen, we've accelerated our investments and to be sure that acceleration is paid off in the first quarter and then acceleration in the second quarter. And specifically in the second quarter you've see an acceleration across all of our categories relative to that investment. You've seen acceleration across all of our geographies ex-Asia with that investment. So we're pleased by frankly with the focus that we put in a story that we\u2019re building throughout the organization, which is to accelerate top line growth through an accelerated Investment Strategy, you're certainly seeing that payoff. We haven't seen the shares move, as you mentioned we started to see some of the accelerate as we move through the back half of the quarter. The total which is received a decent amount investment in the first half and will continue to receive investment through the balance of the year. Our shares are up globally on that basis. And remember a big part of that was ensuring the investment help us generate the price increase that we executed behind that relaunch, which is on average we are seeing about 10% come through on total globally. So the Investment Strategy to ensure that they had a successful launch we think is playing out. And as you heard from John, likewise on Science Diet where we've accelerated investment we've seen growth across all areas of the P&L and all areas of the business. So again, from an investment standpoint, the story was more investment to generate top line growth and we\u2019re seeing that we take on a balance basis throughout the world. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English : Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for sorting me in. We\u2019ve obviously covered a reasonable ground already. I guess, I'd like drill in a bit deeper on Latin America. As already referenced in money to your market share by country Brazil and Mexico are two areas are excluded from your market share growth figures, yet Latin America has been sort of held up as the area where you reach to your innovation process. It's got perhaps the fastest speed to market a lot going on, you've been expanded channels. Can you update us on the progress of that? And how\u2019s it maybe sequentially market share maybe building in these markets? And also still sticking Latin America, sorry really is a still long winded, this is also the area where going to your segment bridges you're seeing more sequential increase in overhead expenses and the increases is pricing in context of the FX pressure there. Can you give us a little more color on where that money is going in that market? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Okay. A lot there. So let me step back on Latin America. Again, the focus strategy around core adjacencies and segments we think is really playing out in the quarter. And again, sequentially up on the first quarter, they've now seen two strong quarters of growth and very balanced growth at that relative to pricing and volume. Good pricing coming through in the quarter as well, which is obviously driven by some changes that we made on Colgate Total, as well as our reacting to some of the inflationary pressures that we saw coming through the P&L in the back half of 2018. Looking specifically at Mexico and Brazil, I think we're quite pleased and what we're seeing there. On Brazil, obviously, the categories look okay, slightly down in the second quarter, but on the half still up versus where we were last year. We've seen some promotional pricing on the lower end of the franchise particularly around the Sorriso brand, which we talked about in the first quarter. That continued in the second quarter obviously a bigger dip in February on shares, but starting to see that slowly come back. But more pleasingly was the launch of Colgate Total in both those markets has done very, very well, just getting out of the gates about a month and half of real clear readings on it in Brazil the share is up about 0.5 points on Colgate Total to at least from what I'm seeing a record high share for quite some time at $17.5. And likewise in Mexico, we're up over a point on Colgate Total, where overall shares are flat. So I think the strategy that we're putting in place particularly on Oral Care and driving the core paying off, as I mentioned I think previously, they are pushing aggressively into new channel expansion in pharmacy with the launch of elmex that is driving incremental share in pharmacy as we speak. And we're happy to see what elmex is doing and continues to grow month end and month out. And the launching into some new adjacencies as well across the division which is doing well. What I was particularly excited about in the quarter was every single operating hub group across Latin America. We haven't see that for quite some time at least consistently. So again, I think the strategies there that we're deploying around the core adjacencies and segments are playing well. Good pricing in the second quarter, which will play out obviously with our Investment Strategy in the back half. And we're seeing more and more investment go in. Coming back to certain extent to Ali's question, as we see Latin America accelerate, our Latin America has a lower advertising to sales given some of the cost of media in those businesses and that obviously moved its way through the overall company P&L. But again good plants in the back half with accelerated investment in that region. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks so much. Noel Wallace : Hi, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : I wanted first to just follow-up on Brazil. I was actually focused a little bit more on volume just to comparisons, because I know that last year we had the Brazil trucking strike notwithstanding efforts is that a market share question. But I was just curious about volume trajectory in Brazil. If there was any impact there from some of the pricing you've taken in terms of the slower build back on volumes specifically? And then I do have a second bigger-picture question. Thanks. Noel Wallace : Okay. Sure. So yes, we did take pretty significant pricing in the quarter. And I'll remind everyone that the cadence volume and pricing that we had last year as you may recall most of the truckers strike out the impact of that hit us in the third quarter. So the comparisons get much easier for us going forward. We didn't have - while we did have a small hit in the second quarter last year, it wasn't to the extent that we saw it in the third quarter, which is where most of the impact came through the P&L. In this quarter, our volume was slightly down, but pricing was strong. And largely driven by some of the price changes that we made based on some of the inflationary pressures that we faced in the back half of the year. Categories continue to be okay as I mentioned earlier and we got a strong innovation pipeline in the balance of the year and investment to support that. So we feel we are in a good position to see continued acceleration, particularly given the comparisons get easier in the year to go. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Bonnie Herzog : Hi, thank you. Good morning. Actually, I wanted to circle back to some of your comments on your top line. I guess, I'm trying to understand your ability to sustain the improvements you've seen, especially as you head into next year and you have to let the innovation of the re-launches that you put into the market. And I know you're not going to give guidance for 2020, but could you touch on your ability to lap the innovation from this year? And then, maybe how full year innovation pipeline is for next year? Also as we think about your spending levels that did increase things continue to improve will you continue to reinvest in your business a long-term or should we start to see some of these potential upside sort of the bottom line? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Thanks. Specifically on the topline next year is no different than any year in the sense of that we continue to be focused on ensuring that we have won the right level of innovation to continue to drive incremental value in the market that we're focused on driving category value which is extremely important. You heard John talk a little bit about the success we're having behind revenue growth management and the discipline that we're deploying across the world to ensure that teams are thinking very differently about how to drive value back into the category which ultimately drives better topline growth for us and our trade customers. And then likewise as we look at some of the adjacencies geographic expansion opportunities we have each year being very deliberate about how we go after those. And so next year we'll be looking at some category expansion opportunities into new markets, we'll be looking into new agencies, and we'll be looking to support new core businesses as we mentioned which is going to be important part of our growth strategy moving forward to ensure every 12 to 18 months, we have a significant core business that we're putting investment behind to ensure that the incremental innovation we're getting behind adjacencies and channel expansion indeed comes on top. In terms of getting gross margins up and our focus there, I think we're starting - we're really happy with the fact that we've seen gross margin acceleration this quarter. That is the function I think of again sharpened focus on finding the growth, but more importantly, the pricing that we have taken on the revenue growth management aspects that are coming more a day in and day out in terms of how we manage the business. As we look at the back half as we see more benign inflation environment, particularly around foreign exchange, we expect that to continue to bode well for the gross margin line which will all of the investment that we need in the business to continue to accelerate that topline growth on a sustainable basis. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Please go ahead. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, thanks very much. A couple of things. First of all can you disclose how much the distribution expansion for Elta and PCA contributed to your organic sales growth? Second quick thing just in terms of the comments you made, Noel, about how the channel market share data hasn't looked as good as you expected to, but actually the North American shipments looks pretty good this quarter. So, my question is do you have sense or is there any there could be excess inventory in the trade? In other North American growth have to slow as the market share is kind of catch up with your shipments? And then my last question is with Justin having left the company as you kind of look at the management structure as you settle as new CEO, do you think is there going to be a new Chief Growth Officer? Are there other changes in sort of the management structure contemplated or is this just a typical Colgate succession planning all that kind of good step rolling through? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Great, Wendy. Thanks. Let me go one by one. Specifically, we don't disclose and break out obviously PCA and Elta within the context of the U.S. I'd say the growth was balanced. We had growth across all of our core segments in the quarter in the U.S. specifically Oral Care, Personal Care, and Home Care, as well as on the Hill's business as John mentioned, and obviously PCA and Elta continue to have a good quarter in that regard. Relative to the management structure question, obviously, as you well know as well as anyone we have a deep bench of tremendous leaders across the organization. With Justin's departure, we\u2019re looking to obviously continue to develop our organization for people in new roles and responsibilities and we're in the process of making that happen. We've made some recent changes, which I'm really excited about, which elevated the responsibility of [indiscernible] specifically and move some new people into new roles across the organization and all that I think bodes well for practically the strategy that we're trying to execute moving forward. So in that case all good moves and very qualified bench of people to choose from in that regard. Relative to your question on inventories, I know that came up last time as well, I think from Ali, there is no inventory issues in the U. S. And we've had nice growth and untrack channels as you know particularly around the toothpaste business, Colgate Total way over in indexes and club, had a good quarter on club, having a good growth in some of other track channels e-commerce specifically. We saw significant share growth on the toothpaste business in the quarter, so all that obviously rolling up to a stronger organic delivery in the quarter for the North American business. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Strycula with UBS. Please go ahead. Steve Strycula : Hi, good morning. My question is after three recent acquisitions, it appears that you're slowly stitching together a global premium skincare business with the clinical focus. So how do we think about the leadership and integration strategy of these businesses and one is in primarily France and China versus other assets in the U.S. How it is being integrated? What\u2019s the leadership structure? And then if you could give us any more texture separately on the oral care business in China, you mentioned some improvement sequentially. But where are we in terms of milestones and repairing that business, maybe some qualitative talking points? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. So listen as we have learned in many of the successful acquisitions that we\u2019ve made and we've been very prudent in approaching these acquisitions in this way and that is to ensure that we respect and admire the independence of these organizations. And from that perspective we will continue to run independently as we learn the business and more importantly understand how we can leverage some of the best practices across our entire skin care portfolio. So today Elta, PCA and Filorga are run independently, but that being we have a team of people here in New York as we\u2019ve done through our other categories, ensuring that we are looking holistically at the business, leveraging the synergies that we see across the three different businesses. And more importantly from a growth opportunity ensuring that we\u2019re sharing best practices across the three businesses to sustain accelerated growth moving forward. And as we go through the due diligence of each of those acquisitions, we very much put that in the back of our mind, how are these going to help the other businesses that we have. Not only on the skin care side, but obviously on the Colgate portfolio side as well in terms of transferring best practices. And that's something historically and culturally that we've done really well across the company. And that is to share the learning. And there's a tremendous sense of humility when we go in and make an acquisition to respect the depth of the management team what they've accomplished and to ensure that we listen and learn, but provide the scale and the efficiencies to them, so they can continue to drive top line growth. On the China question, it is moving exactly as anticipated. It is slightly ahead of schedule relative to some of the pickup that was on the quarter, but a lot of work to do. And we\u2019ll continue to see momentum build in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter this year based on the plans that we're executing as we speak. Operator : Our next question will come from Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Javier Escalante : Back to China again. So basically this improvement if you can basically split it between acceptance of the price increases as you took last year versus if is it elmex that is gaining traction online or is it that the destocking that is [indiscernible] And I have a more longer-term question after that. Noel Wallace : Thanks Javier. It's all of the above. Obviously as the go-to-market shifts happen so dramatically across specifically China over the last nine months, we needed to rebalance the inventory in the market and that is well underway and we've seen improvements in that respect. The elmex launch continues to do well and -- as it widen its distribution both across different e-commerce platforms and a rollout in Watson as well. So all in all, it's all those elements, the pricing likewise holding particularly on the 360 franchise that we took in the back half of last year, but it's all really trying to get the portfolio right the go to market strategies changes, right, the distributors strategies implemented as well. And all that is on schedule as I mentioned. Operator : Our next question will come from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kevin Grundy : Thanks, good morning. Noel two-part question, if I can. First one just gauging the success of the Colgate Total rollout in the U. S.. Some of the Neilson data we see, suggest the brand is down about 0.5 point. I think the hope was to take some share from Sensodyne. Sensodyne seems like the market share trends are accelerating there. Maybe talk a little bit about of your gauging success so far with the product rollout to date? And then I hope, I can throw another one here. John spoke to the company superior results in the online channel where you're gaining share. And of course we've seen skin channels with the company is probably not where it hopes to be at this point from a market share perspective and bleeding little bit of share in Oral Care. Why do think that is? And maybe you can speak tactically what you need to do to address that? Thanks for those. Noel Wallace : Sure. So again on Colgate Total, if you look globally where we are right now, the share is up, close to 0.5 point on the business. And that obviously considers the fact that we're down about 20 basis points in the U.S. which is on a weighted basis weighs very heavily into that 0.5 points growth that we have globally. So we're very pleased with where we are. Specifically on the U.S. recognized that we took a 16% downsizing on that product. So we're looking for the purchase - the recycle - excuse me, the purchase frequency of the brand to accelerate share moving forward. You're not going to get the price acquisition immediately moving through the consumption and therefore the share that will over time accelerate as we get the frequency of repurchased to accelerate. So all in all, we\u2019re pleased with where we are particularly pleased with the fact that we generated about a 10% increase globally on that business which is one of the more significant increases that we've seen on that franchise and over a decade. And that bodes well, given that we have a sustainable spending on that business in the back of and we continue to rollout and some of our bigger baskets, particularly Latin America we just got under way towards the back end of the quarter. So all in all we are pleased. Not pleased with the track channels and despite the fact that we are growing in un-track channels really well, we need to get track channels growing again. So a lot of coupon activity in the first half of the year. We saw some share erosion on the base business in the first quarter which we're obviously trying to play a little bit of catch-up, but we're not going to chase some of this coupon driven activity that we're seeing. We want to ensure that we continue to move the franchise towards the premium end both on Colgate, Total with the launch of the Naturals and with the launch of some of the Whitening SKUs that we're putting into the market which will hopefully drive more incrementality moving forward. So more work to be done to be sure, but pleased over where we are with total re-launch. Operator : And our next question will come from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Bill Chappell : Good morning. Thanks. Hey, Noel just kind of big picture on emerging markets it certainly sounds more optimistic about kind of how things are trending. And I guess, the question is we saw the similar type optimism 18, 24 months ago, and then it went south for not just you but for everyone. I mean, is there a way to kind of talk about how this time is different? Or if it's not different so far are you just kind of cautiously optimistic in kind of what you see on the horizon? Noel Wallace : Sure, Bill. So I'll let me - again we talked about Asia quite extensively, so I won't get into more specifics, obviously a good growth outside of China and the plans in place to see China continue to make progress in the back half of the year. I haven't talked a lot about Africa as you remembered that was a real headwind for us over the last couple of years, a completely focused on the fundamentals in those markets and some terrific execution by the team on the ground. We've seen a real acceleration in that business moving forward pleasingly Russia doing quite well Eurasia, Turkey likewise doing quite well where we achieved market leadership very recently in the toothpaste category in that market. So again Africa we think doing quite well and the fundamentals will bode well moving forward. Latin America, largely driven by some of the economic and political changes that we saw over the last 18 months and we'll be cautious on Latin America moving forward. So particularly in Brazil and Mexico, where you've seen political change, and new leaders in their first year of their administration we'll see how that unfolds. There's always uncertainty associated with that. But the categories was slightly down in the second quarter on the first half as I mentioned earlier up versus where they were last year. But the fundamentals I think we have in Latin America around again the core, the adjacencies and the channel work that we are doing we think will continue to bode well through the back half of this year and the comparisons particularly Latin America \u2013 America favor us as we look to the back half. Bill Chappell : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Nik Modi : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So just two little quick ones. Noel Wallace : Hey, Nik. Nik Modi :  Noel, maybe you can - hey, how are you? Good morning. Maybe you can just talk about your definition of skin health? And I'm just curious, if your definition longer term would extend outside of Queens [ph]? So that's the first question. And on the second question is really on FX. I mean, obviously its created tons of havoc over the years for all multinational companies. Coca-Cola provided some thoughts about how they expected to be a benign year in 2020 and I was hoping maybe you have some thoughts from your treasury group on have you guys are thinking about FX as you think about the next 12 months? Noel Wallace : Sure. Let me take that FX question first. Obviously, we saw an acceleration of FX in the back half particularly Latin America and Eurasia. And we're expecting a slightly more benign environment obviously given those comparisons, but we can't be certain. There's obviously a lot of political instability and lot of rhetoric going on around the world. So I would hate to sit here and tried to predict exactly where FX is going to go. I'll remain cautious but we think it will be certainly better than what we experienced in the back half of last year. Specifically, as it relates to skin health, it's a big category. Obviously, there's a lot of different spaces to it. We like Elta and the sun care business. It's got a great skin cleansing business which is close into what we understand. PCA is uniquely positioned in the categories in which they compete. We like those. And the recent acquisition of Filorga obviously on the antiaging, we like that space a lot specifically one because of the economics of the space and the premium nature of it, but more importantly, as you look at the aging consumer everywhere in the world that will continue to be an expanding category for skin health. So, while we're being selective on where we go in. We want to ensure that we have great brands with great go-to-market and great management teams and that's kind of how we've looked at skin health, but obviously, the three are we believe are well-positioned where they compete and complement each other the longer term really well. Operator : We'll take the next question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks. I wanted to talk about the U.S. You alluded to a couple of efforts to improve performance in track channels, so little bit more detail there on how these initiatives help specifically in track channels? But also you continued to do significantly better in non-track, so is there any reason to expect that that relationship will change as you put more focus on track channels, presumably you're not driving growth in track by shifting between the two? And then just one quick thing on SG&A. Obviously, higher comp logistics you talked about, but some of it, it sounds like restoring sort of more normalized levels of comp, but is there anything in terms of like the investments that you're making hiring more people building out capabilities and systems and things like that? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Okay. So, let me try to address the first question there which is on track channels and untrack channels and how we think about that. First, we take a step back and ensure that as I mentioned upfront that we're really understanding the changes in the omnichannel environment and those changes happen very quickly relative to where the growth is coming from and how consumers are shopping. So, we\u2019ve invested a lot more time and effort to ensure that we have a much sharper strategies around our go-to-market for ensure that we are putting resources, spending, and innovation against of the standards that we think are going to continue to accelerate. Particularly as it relates to the U.S., obviously, great growth in the first half of the year on e-commerce, our share up about 140 basis points, split between both Colgate and Palms and that's a function of one understanding the route-to-market and the route-to-purchase from consumer and getting innovation and the execution right in that channel. We talked about pharmacy channel around the world being one of the faster-growing channels that we see globally and we put plans in place to execute that both from a resource standpoint. And what I mean specifically by that is how we allocate our sales organization to growing opportunities and likewise from an innovation standpoint and from a portfolio standpoint where we've launched elmex, particularly in the very select geographies where the pharmacy channel is outpacing the market and where we're under-indexed in terms of share. So again, Olivia, we look at it very holistically and our channel strategies are allocated based on where we see the best growth opportunities. And when I talked a little bit upfront about how we're thinking about growth differently and how we are driving growth differently, it's ensuring that we're looking at each of those channels very exclusively in terms of our go to market, specifically as it relates to the innovation required to be successful. And we're starting to see that play off as we see the acceleration, particularly in non-track channels moving forward. On the SG&A, I think you hit it all already, but the last point you made is an interesting one in the sense of as we look at allocating resources and driving productivity across the organization, it really is ensuring that we are putting people in places that want to go to drive more accelerated growth for the company. So let's take their of digital and analytics and predictive analytics and making sure that we are putting resources in those areas because, we believe that will bode well and drive more sustainable growth and efficiency across the P&L moving forward. So, it's a shifting of resources in that line. The SG&A acceleration you saw in the quarter was not a result of adding more people, it was a result of the specific areas that I articulated earlier. Operator : And our final question will come from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Thanks and good morning everybody. Noel Wallace : Hi Mark. Mark Astrachan : Two questions. One on Filorga. If you can just comment on what the growth rates have looked like trailing 12 months may be expectations on a go-forward basis. And on Pet Nutrition, so a large competitor reported similarly strong topline results this morning. I guess it seems like category growth rates not to take anything away from your performance have accelerated. So I guess I'm curious, what you think is driving the acceleration? How much is it priced versus underling category demand and what do you think a reasonable long-term growth rate would be from a category perspective? Noel Wallace : Thanks, Mark. So back on Filorga, obviously, all I can disclose at this point, the acquisition hasn't closed is that we're very attracted by not only the growth rates of the category itself, but the growth rates of Filorga and the potential for continued growth in geographic expansion moving forward. And will disclose more information as we bring that under the Colgate family. Specifically, as it relates to the premiumization and the dog food category and the pet food category, I mean good growth we've seen a bit more stability in pet retail especially among PetSmart and PETCO, but still somewhat challenged that continued acceleration of e-commerce where we\u2019re seeing nice growth in that business. And I think importantly, as we are seeing share growth around -- in the U.S. around the signs diet relaunch, which again included obviously significant packaging changes, significant reformulations, new campaigns and accelerated investment which will all intended to help support and drive trial, but more importantly justify the price increase that we took on the business which we had done in quite some time. So, all in all, we think the plans we have in place on hills. The fact that we've expanded distribution into some new channels and we got a terrific piece of advertising working for the business will bode well as we look to expand the Science Diet relaunch internationally in the back half. Operator : And this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to John Faucher for any additional or closing remarks. John Faucher : So let me quickly close, as always, let me thank the entire Colgate family of people out there that have done such a terrific job again delivering sequential growth in the quarter. I remind everyone we\u2019re in the third quarter, get back to work. And thanks everyone, have a great weekend. Operator : Again ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded, and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John. John Faucher : Thanks, Paula. Good Morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me this morning are Noel Wallace, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Henning Jakobsen, Chief Financial Officer. I will begin with some thoughts on our performance before discussing our updated 2019 guidance. We'll then open it up for Noel's Q&A session. The third quarter marked a further step in our plan to return to sustainable organic sales growth. Throughout 2019, we are focused on innovating around the core of our business, driving growth in adjacent segments and expanding our availability in faster growth markets and channels. Along with higher levels of consumer-facing spending, these strategies are paying off in broad-based growth across our businesses. Q3 marked the third quarter in a row where we delivered a combination of both volume and pricing growth on an organic basis. Volume was up in every division, and pricing was positive in every division, except for one. Our revenue growth management strategies are driving pricing growth as we focus on premium innovation. On a geographic basis, we saw organic sales growth in five of our six divisions. Importantly, we returned to organic sales growth in Asia Pacific, including delivering organic sales growth in the Greater China region. We drove a good combination of developed market growth, plus 3.5%; and emerging market growth, plus 6%. And from a category standpoint, we again delivered organic sales growth across all four of our businesses : Oral Care, Personal Care, Home Care and Pet Nutrition. In order to drive this growth, we continue to invest behind our businesses. Total advertising spending was up nicely in the quarter. In particular, I would point to Hill's where a significant increase in spending over the past few years behind our purpose-driven marketing has been a key driver of the organic sales growth. We were also pleased to close the Filorga transaction on September 19th, continuing the expansion of our Personal Care portfolio into skin health, although we point out that Filorga's results from the acquisition date through quarter end were immaterial to our results of operations and were not included in our Q3 results. On the sustainability front, we received recognition from the Dow Jones Worldwide Sustainability Index, taking the lead in our industry sector for the first time. Back in September, Noel discussed our new recyclable toothpaste tube. We are currently in production and it will be on shelf under the Tom's brand in November. Moving to our Q3 results. Our net sales grew 2% in the quarter. We delivered 4.5% organic sales growth, with 3% unit volume growth and 1.5% favorable pricing. This was partially offset by foreign exchange impact of minus 2.5%. On a GAAP basis, our gross margin was even with Q3 2018. Excluding the impact of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, it was down 20 basis points year-over-year. Pricing was a positive 70 basis point impact to gross margin in the third quarter, while our productivity programs drove a 240 basis point benefit. This was offset by a 310 basis point drag from raw materials inflation, which included foreign trend -- foreign exchange transaction costs. Other, primarily mix was unfavorable by 20 basis points. Our stronger growth in emerging markets relative to our developed markets business put some slight pressure on our gross margin. On an absolute basis, advertising investment was up 7% year-over-year. On a percent of sales basis, advertising was up 50 basis points year-over-year. Excluding charges resulting from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program and advertising spending, our SG&A expenses were up year-over-year in the third quarter on an absolute basis, but down as a percent of sales, as we were able to offset higher compensation and other costs with savings from our productivity programs. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share of $0.67 were up 12% year-over-year in Q3. Excluding charges resulting from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program in 2019 and 2018, acquisition costs in 2019 and a charge related to U.S. tax reform in 2018, diluted earnings per share were down 1.5% to $0.71. Our free cash flow through the first nine months of 2019 was $1.9 billion, which was up 3% versus prior year. Taking a quick look at the divisions. North America net sales grew 1.5% in the quarter, driven by 1% pricing growth and 0.5% volume growth. There was no FX impact in the quarter. Our performance in e-commerce where we continue to see strong share growth and other non-measured channels, was partially offset by declines in food retail. We also remain very pleased with the performance of our skin health businesses, Elta MD and PCA Skin. Our focus in North America continues to be on the premiumization of our Oral Care portfolio through innovation. Colgate Total SF and Colgate Optic White drove pricing growth in the quarter, and we have further innovation to come in the next few quarters, particularly on Optic White. Europe posted a 5% decline in net sales, with organic sales flat and foreign exchange minus 5%. Growth in Northern Europe behind the relaunch of Colgate Total and our whitening brands, was offset by weakness in Western Europe, where the retail environment continues to be difficult. As with North America, we expect significant premium innovation to drive improved price mix going forward, as we have a full calendar of naturals innovation in the first half of 2020. Latin America net sales were up 3%, as 4.5% volume and 3.5% pricing were only partially offset by 5% negative foreign exchange. Our 8% organic sales growth was broad-based, as we saw organic sales growth in every hub for the third quarter in a row. While Brazil benefited from the year ago comparison, which included some impact from the trucker strike, the underlying business remains solid and pricing was up nicely, driven by premium products like Protex Face and Colgate Total 12. Net sales in Asia Pacific were up 2.5%. Volume growth was 2%. Pricing grew 1%, while foreign exchange was minus 0.5%. Organic sales growth of 3% was our first positive result in six quarters. Importantly, we delivered organic sales growth in the Greater China region in the quarter, driven by improvements in both volume and pricing. While the China improvement in the third quarter was ahead of our expectations, we remain laser-focused on executing our plan to return the business to sustainable profitable growth through improved go-to-market capabilities, China-specific innovation and improved brand marketing. Asia-Pacific growth was led by toothpaste, particularly our naturals portfolio and Colgate anti-cavity toothpaste. The Africa/Eurasia division delivered 5% net sales growth in the quarter, its best result in several years. Organic sales growth of 6% consisted of 4% pricing growth and 2% organic volume growth. FX was a 2% drag on net sales growth, while our newly established joint venture in Nigeria was a 1% benefit to net sales and volume growth. The organic sales growth in Africa/Eurasia was consistent across all hubs and we are particularly pleased with our strong performance in Eurasia in the quarter where our focus on faster growth channels like discounters is paying off. Momentum on our pet food business continued in Q3, as Hill's delivered 8.5% net sales growth and 10% organic sales growth. Hill\u2019s' 6.5% volume growth was their best results since 2006. Pricing was positive at 3.5%, while foreign exchange was negative at minus 1.5%. Our core innovation strategy continues to deliver robust growth in North America and is now beginning to pay off internationally as we rollout the Science Diet relaunch around the globe. In August, Hill's partnered on NBCUniversal's annual Clear the Shelters Pet adoption campaign in the U.S. This year's campaign was its most successful ever, with over 160,000 pets adopted over the course of the campaign, an increase of 57% versus last year's program. Hill's earned over 9,000 displays, which helped drive the strong U.S. volume growth in the quarter. Moving on to guidance. We continue to expect net sales to be flat to up low-single-digits. We have raised our organic sales growth target to plus 3% to 4%, with the full-year growth rate roughly in line with year-to-date growth. We now expect our full-year gross margin to be down slightly on both a GAAP basis and excluding the items referenced in the earnings press release. We do expect gross margin to be up year-over-year on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter. We would expect advertising as a percent of sales for the full year to be fairly consistent with the year-to-date level. We now expect our full-year 2019 tax rate to be between 24% and 24.5%, both on a GAAP basis and excluding the items referenced in the earnings press release. Our previous guidance was for 25% to 26%. This change includes the recent reduction in corporate taxes in India. As mentioned on the Q2 call, we will moderate our share repurchase activity for the next several quarters in order to return to a leverage ratio more in line with our ratio before the Filorga transaction. Based on current spot rates, we expect the GAAP earnings per share to be down low-single-digits for the year. Excluding the items referenced in the earnings press release, we still expect earnings per share to decline mid-single-digits for the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Noel for the Q&A. Paula? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. First, we'll go to Steve Strycula with UBS. Steve Strycula : So, Noel, question on the gross margin and for John as well. How do we think about what caused the weakness in Q3 in gross margin sequentially from the last quarter and what changes, if anything, to drive the positive inflection in Q4 and into next year? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Steve. So yes, we're disappointed with the gross margin in the third quarter. A couple things that happened that we weren't expecting. Obviously, the sales mix, as John outlined, with more growth coming with emerging markets had a softening impact on the margin line. This significant growth we saw on the Hill's business, which quite frankly was extraordinary. We're very pleased about that. Obviously, the mix more toward Science Diet versus prescription diet, obviously, compressed the margin a bit. Raw materials were slightly worse than we were expecting as we went into the quarter, as was foreign exchange, slightly worse than we were expecting as we went into the quarter. So overall, a couple surprises that came through. We're focused on the premiumization. We're focused on accelerating, funding the growth through the back half -- through the fourth quarter, excuse me. And obviously, getting the mix right across the regions and that's where we'll focus our attention going into the fourth quarter. So, we're confident we'll see fourth quarter margins rebound as we finish out the year. Operator : And next, we'll go to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Thank you. I was curious if you could talk a little bit about trends in North America. And I know Nielsen data clearly does not tell the full picture of your Oral Care business. But then seeing the results this quarter, it feels like we're still very much more price-mix heavy than volume heavy. So if you can talk a little bit about how that Total relaunch is progressing? What you're now seeing in terms of repeat, and if it -- maybe a thought that the pricing has gone possibly a little bit too far on that brand? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Thanks, Lauren. Yeah, let me talk broadly on Colgate Total. Obviously, we're really pleased with the relaunch. Our shares are up on a global basis versus where they were pre-launch. As you know, we took a 10% price increase on that business globally. Particularly as it relates to the U.S., we took a 20% price increase on that business. There has been some elasticity that we've seen come through. Our share is down about three-tenths of a share point versus where we were before we started the relaunch. A little bit disappointing, we expected it to be flat to up. We're in the midst of looking at our messaging and ensure we get that corrected as we continue to accelerate investment behind that business moving forward. But pleased given the significance of the price increase that were slightly down, but more importantly, we'd like to see that turn around as we get some of the go-to-market and some of the marketing plans more sharp in the balance of the year. But globally, pleased, as I mentioned, the fact that we've gotten a 10% increase and we're growing share is a real progress for us. And we'll continue to put the investment behind that business as we move through the balance of this year and into the first half of next year. It's consistent with our -- with our strategy to get the core businesses moving and we'll look to relaunch some other core businesses in 2020. We will start to outline that as we move into the first quarter press release. Some of the excitement that we have on some of the innovation coming down that, that will come with more pricing as you would expect and more premiumizations. All-in-all, I think we're pleased with Colgate Total overall. The U.S. was a bump this quarter for sure. We were expecting a little bit more. It's been a tough promotional environment in the U.S. Other channels, non-tracked channels continue to do well, but not as well as we had in the second quarter, so a bit lumpy in that regard. We're very focused in the U.S., specifically on premium innovation and getting that right as we move into 2020. Our revenue growth management principles that we're starting to embed across the entire commercial organization, we see the discipline coming behind that. And we're quite optimistic that we'll see gross margins continue to improve as we move through the balance of 2020 and we'll see the shares come back as we start to put the premiumization strategy in place. Operator : And moving on, we'll go to Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : So tremendous top line performance in pet again this quarter. I guess the question for me is how does that compare to -- how does that compare to your plan coming in and how does it influence your thinking, if at all, going forward? Relatedly, when do you think you might see more of a profit inflection in that business, commensurate with the top-line momentum? And then if I could tack on a follow-on to Steve's Strycula question at the open. And I hear you on the puts and takes on gross margin in the quarter. But just as a follow-up on that, how might this quarter influence your thinking about realistic gross margin objectives looking into 2020? Because your 2019 represents, I think, the fourth time in about -- fourth time in five years that Colgate has come into the year targeting material gross margin improvement only to finish effectively flattish or down on the year. And I get the macro pressures. But I also see there is a recurring trend. So just how do you protect against being kind of overreaching again in 2020 and having to course correct midyear? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Thanks, Steve. Let me get -- address Hill's first. Obviously, an extraordinary quarter for the Hill's business. The Science Diet relaunch, which is largely driven by the U.S. right now, we're in the midst of rolling that out through the rest of the world. So, we're quite excited about what that will bring moving forward. But the U.S. had just an exceptional quarter, particularly behind Science Diet. I think everything that we've been talking about in terms of driving the core, increase in the advertising, getting the pricing right on that business, getting the go-to-market and new channel distribution right. In fact, we were up 14% in farm and feed in the quarter and that just is a result of increased focus on some of these emerging channels. Our e-commerce shares grew eight-tenths of a share point. Our pet specialty share grew eight-tenths of a share point. So, all of this bodes well for sustainable growth moving forward. We see the continued growth in the pet category. Prescription diet has a significant amount of innovation coming in 2020, and we'll see that continue to play through the business. That obviously plays out in a much higher margin for the business. So the gross margins will improve as we move forward. We were surprised a bit, again, on the gross margin and the raw material increases that we saw on vitamins and other agricultural products in the quarter. The business has taken price increases at the beginning of the quarter, behind both the Science Diet business and the prescription diet business in order to recover that and build gross margins moving forward. So on Hill's, very pleased. It's sustainable. It's broad-based. And we've got the good news coming in terms of international expansion of SD and some good innovation coming on prescription diet. So all bodes well there. On your margin question, obviously, coming back to the core of our strategy, which is driving the core businesses with price increases in innovation, getting adjacencies right. Obviously, we're very pleased with how the portfolio is shaping up around skin health and the significant margin accretion over the long-term that will bring to our business and the growth that will bring to our business. The adjacent segments that we're going into, particularly around products with natural ingredients, particularly around sensitivity and gum around the world will bode well, channel expansion into pharmacies where we under index. Likewise, we have significant expansion opportunities in that channel, which will drive improved gross margin moving forward. So listen, we're disappointed. We know our history has been about consistent gross margin improvement. We are laser-focused on delivering the productivity through the P&L to make that happen moving forward. And I think as you see, the top-line continue to grow, which we've been focused on throughout this year. You're going to see the gross margins come behind that as we move through 2020. Operator : And Jason English with Goldman Sachs has our next question. Jason English : Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in. I appreciate it. I'm going to build off of both of those points, real quick on pet. I see your incredibly strong numbers and congrats on that. I also see Nestle strong numbers on its legacy premium brand coming out the U.S. It does beg the question of whether or not we're seeing a broader market movement, pivoting back away from grain-free to some of the products you're offering and Nestle is offerings as well. I'd love it, if you could comment on that, particularly in the wake of the DCM concerns out there? And then coming back to gross margin real quick. I hear you on the mix components, but I'm nonetheless really surprised when we delve into North America and see 220 basis points of gross margin compression. Despite sort of an easy comp, sequentially your margins eroded a lot more in that market. Inflation pressure stepped up a lot, which seems to defy the broader cost curves we're looking at. And frankly, it leaves me a bit confounded. And I love it, if you could delve deeper there and just to illuminate what's happening there so we can better understand it? Noel Wallace : Sure. Jason. Let me take the Hill's question first. Obviously, DCM has had an impact. I mean, I think there has been a return particularly to products like ours, which are very science-based and there\u2019s tremendous trust that we built over the years behind our brand. And as John mentioned, really moving a lot more advertising to our purpose-driven advertising I think has created great credibility and resonates with the consumer and the pet owners. And you've seen that translate into growth. Obviously, we're very premium priced. The broader market, which is, obviously, you see some of the competitors move into grocery. We think that's also afforded an opportunity for us to continue to differentiate ourselves, which I think talks to more long-term sustainability for that business moving forward. And the innovation pipeline, as I mentioned, is rich and robust. And they're bold on the pricing. So, I expect that business will continue to be -- perform very well for us. Now specifically on North America margins, obviously, very disappointed with what happened in the quarter. Both volume and pricing was a little below our expectations. Mix worked really against us in the quarter, both from a channel standpoint, from a sizing standpoint and from a category standpoint. So, we had all three moving against us in the quarter and we need to address that. And the team has put plans in place for the fourth quarter to get that turned around and ensuring as we move into the budget plans for 2020, that we address that. Manufacturing costs, likewise, were a little bit higher. That was the surprise. We're all over that, and we'll address that as we move into 2020. We expect Q4 to be up in North America. There will be some continued headwinds as we get the channels and the sizes are sorted out in terms of where we see the business. But likewise, I think, as we've seen across the total business that we'll see margins improve in the fourth quarter. The other areas, we're seeing lifts on promotion are not delivering what we expected. Obviously, a slightly more competitive environment with some of the smaller brands in the category. And I think as we continue to accelerate our spending, particularly in digital where we can gain, I believe an advantage, we're going to see that, hopefully, translate back to bigger brands growing faster. So, those are the components. We're on it. We're not pleased at all with it. And likewise, as we go into North America as we continue to accelerate the skin business, that will bode well for margins over the longer term. Operator : And moving on, we'll go to Wendy Nicholson of Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. Just following up on that. First, on the skin care business, you've got three acquisitions. It sounds like you're pleased with each of them. It sounds like that each kind of fell a different niche. But can you comment on sort of any further appetite there? Do you feel like you kind of are where you want to be in skin with those three different businesses? But then my bigger question first, really just a follow-up. My bigger question is, you talked about maybe expanding the sort of relaunch initiative or program like you have with Total and Hill's this year, into some new categories next year. So bottom line, I'm wondering will operating margin go up next year? I care less about gross margin. I care more about how much you plan to spend on marketing? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Thanks, Wendy. Yes, on your second question, we're not going to guide yet on 2020 as we get into the first quarter. We will give you deep transparency in terms of how we're thinking about margins and operating margins. But overall, if you take where we've been historically, I think you can interpret that we would obviously like to see all those moving in the right direction. Specifically, on the skincare, as you said, we're really pleased. I just returned from a two-week trip around the world meeting with some of the Filorga people, welcoming them into the Colgate family both in Europe and in China. And I was deeply excited from what I saw from a quality of talent standpoint, from the plans they have in place, from the growth they are delivering and the significant gross margins that they have on those businesses. The plans are solid. They're focused in terms of areas that we believe we can win in and where they believe they can win in on the Filorga business. So, I'm pleased they\u2019re not trying to stretch themselves into different areas. They're very focused on the pharmacy channel. They are very focused on online and obviously building their travel retail business out, which is exciting. On Elta and PCA, again, terrific growth in the quarter for the business and we're now looking at the 2020 plans in terms of how we want to expand those businesses, which will be exciting. Obviously, the margins allow us to have a lot more flexibility as we move forward and the growth in the category looks terrific. So overall, we're quite pleased with what we have. Never say never, but our focus is to continue to accelerate the growth on those businesses from a top-line and a bottom-line standpoint. Operator : And next, we'll go to Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. I was wondering if we can return to Oral Care. You mentioned that you were very pleased with the Colgate Total relaunch. I was wondering, first, if you can give us a sense of how much kind of global sales are up for that franchise? And then perhaps go into a little bit more detail globally on how you're doing with therapeutics? How are Elmex and Meridol doing? What markets they've been gaining traction in and maybe how much those are up? And then touch on naturals, particularly in countries that there have been issues and opportunities in China, Russia, and India? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes, we won't comment specifically on the sales numbers. I will tell you that the toothpaste organic growth in the quarter was the highest we've had in six quarters, which is terrific for us. We saw the growth obviously accelerate as we roll Total across Latin America. Mexico and Brazil, our two largest markets, we've had significant success on the rollout of Colgate Total in those markets. Our premium share of the toothpaste segment in both Mexico and Brazil is up. The shares on Colgate Total in Brazil are up about 1.5, in Mexico about 0.5. So, they look terrific and driving, obviously, more of our business into the premium space. Overall, the shares look good on Colgate Total and we're pleased with what we're seeing. Relative to the second part of your question on pricing, the pricing -- I can't remember what you asked me, Robert? Robert Ottenstein : On Elmex and Meridol, and then also on the naturals? Noel Wallace : Thank you. Thank you. Yes, Elmex, as you've heard previously, we launched it in Latin America, specifically in Brazil. That business is doing well. We launched it in the pharmacy channel across both toothpaste, toothbrushes and mouth washes, are seeing great growth on toothpaste, seeing really good growth on toothbrushes. Mouthwash has been a bit soft. Likewise, we launched in China online. We've generated about a six-tenths of a share point in China on that business, which given the number of brands online, that is a good result for us. And we launched it in the NAMET region, the Northern Africa region. And that continues to do well. The other area was in Turkey with Meridol, which I think we talked about a little bit in the second quarter call how pleased we are with the performance of that business in Turkey that is taking us -- taking the business to market leadership with the success we've had behind both Meridol and Colgate. So overall, we're pleased with that and we're in the midst of thinking about the key markets we'll expand in 2020. Operator : Next, we'll go to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hey, guys. So, I just have one kind of broad question, taking a step back a little bit. And we see kind of among your peers the kind of the anomaly with a little bit of difficulty -- certainly relative difficulty taking pricing, particularly with such a big innovation rollout with Total and commodities should have been allowing you to take prices. But it was tougher for you than others. Why do you think that is? Is there particularly different category competitive dynamic? For example, Sensodyne's parent company going public in the next couple of years. And I guess related to that, you've in the past have been pretty adamant about saying that you are investing enough and 2019 is kind of one year, reinvestment year rather than a multi-year investment year. Does anything you've seen so far -- again, the category competitive dynamic, ROIs done on the promotional spend, you mentioned a moment ago. Anything at all that gives you pause on the assertion previously that this isn't a multi-year reinvestment phase for Colgate? And I guess, underlying that whether you're going to have to increase reinvestment even further into 2020? Thanks. Noel Wallace : So, let me take the pricing question first, Ali. We are really pleased with the pricing on a -- we've had -- on a two-year stack, we've had four quarters of sequential growth on pricing, so it looks terrific for us. And I think in an environment that we compete in today, which is certainly very competitive around the world to get that pricing through not only on Colgate Total but across our franchises is terrific. The focus on the core business, bringing real value to consumers into the trade and delivering increased prices through that, we believe is working and that will be the continued strategy moving forward. Your second point on advertising and investment, listen, we need to continue to investing behind our business and we need to continue to accelerate share growth across the world. We've got a robust pipeline of innovation coming. We're going to continue to support that. We've got big core relaunches coming that we will support. But obviously, getting the gross margin going and continued productivity across the P&L is where we are laser-focused on right now. And that's how we'll construct the P&L for 2020 in terms of how we look at using operating margin, both from a gross margin and the [BO] standpoint to help fund the advertising that we'll need to drive the top-line. Operator : Moving on, we'll go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks. Good morning. First, just on the Optic White innovation North America. I would imagine that that's smaller than the Total relaunch. So, can you talk about other things that you're planning to do in the market to help offset the higher base? And then just a follow-up on the advertising. You've been increasing advertising spend for four consecutive quarters now. Organic growth has been steadily improving. But -- like where or how are you going to improve return on your spend because you have some markets and brands that have really taken off like Hill's and you said you were going to improve in China and you did, but then North American growth has now decelerated. So, is there a need to potentially increase investment even more aggressively from here or what's going to improve the ROI on that? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Olivia. So on the North America question, they've got a great pipeline behind Optic White in terms of some of the innovation coming, which will include premiumization. As you can imagine that, likewise, we'll be looking at premiumization around the world on Optic White. In fact, we have introduced a 20-pound toothpaste behind Optic White in UK to give you a sense of the boldness of how we're thinking about some of the premiumization strategies. Likewise, when you take the trend towards natural ingredients in the U.S., you'll see expansions across the Colgate portfolio as obviously a step up on our Tom's of Maine business as well, which we think will be important in terms of driving more premiumization in the North America business and driving more share growth. Relative to pricing and what we need in advertising around the world, listen, let me come back to revenue growth management and how we're trying to embed that across the world, across the commercial organization. We talked about it a bit. But as I travel, I'm getting more encouraged by the fact that it's taking on deep commercial ownership. So historically, we would take pricing and the directive for that came out of the marketing organization. Now, we're taking our GM across the entire commercial enterprise and holding everyone accountable for delivering pricing opportunities moving forward, not just the marketing folks. So, this is going to be shared responsibility to really go after how we drive ASP, which will ultimately bode well, I think, for the margin. And the spending that we'll need around the world to continue to fund the opportunities that we have. So, on the advertising and the P&L dynamics for 2020, we will come back to you in the first quarter and give you a lot more clarity on how we're thinking about things. The return on investment, we'll see really coming through as we continue to focus on these big core businesses, which we need to get turned around. And that's where we're going to get the best return on investment, putting a lot more support behind data analytics, particularly in the digital space where we have the ability to really cultivate learning in terms of what's working, what's not. And that will obviously improve our ROI as we move forward. Operator : And Kevin Grundy with Jefferies, has our next question. Kevin Grundy : Noel, question on North America and specifically the competitive environment currently and looking forward. So in a context overall, there is a consensus view that industry participants have been relatively rational from a pricing and promotion perspective over the past 12 months with pricing that was put into place in the fall. But as the industry starts to cycle this pricing and with commodity headwinds now less onerous than they have been, it would be great to get your updated thoughts on the promotional environment and specifically the potential for competitive intensity to pick up your, potentially, the detriment of the profit pool. So, any thoughts there would be helpful? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes, I think the environment has been more rational, to be sure, around the world, particularly in North America. I would say the one exception would be Brazil where we've seen some odd pricing in some of the categories, which just doesn't make any sense. But specifically, as it relates to North America, we've seen -- obviously, a lot of our competitors are working together with the trade, everyone is looking to drive category value. And that's what we need to do. We need to ensure that our innovation is premium. We need to ensure that it is driving category dollars and that's where everyone wins in that regard. We've seen certainly over the last six months to nine months a little bit of pickup in some of the smaller brands, the trade picking up some of those and pushing those. So in the long-term, my view is the big brands, as they get more dialed in on digital, they get more dialed in on how they do data-driven marketing, you'll see opportunities for the big brands to continue to increase the residents and the relatability that we have with consumers. And that's what's key as we compete against some of these smaller brands. So overall, a rational competitive environment, a little bit more competition from smaller brands. You see a -- the promotional lifts, not as high as they used to be. But I don't see sales on promotion increasing, which is a good news. So, we need to get the innovation right and the premiumization right in North America and we'll be off to the races. Operator : Moving on, we'll go to Bill Chappell with SunTrust . Bill Chappell : Just a little bit follow-up on Mexico in particular, but all of LatAm. We've certainly heard from some of your peers and multinationals that there is some slowing there. And so, I guess, maybe what you're seeing for the key market? And then also your ability to -- in line with all the rest of the questions today -- take price as we go into next year with that in mind? Noel Wallace : Sure. So, let me take the two big markets, Brazil and Mexico. I'll take Brazil first. Brazil, obviously, up versus where we were last year, a little slowdown in the third quarter but the consumer continues to be a pretty robust there. Our business was up double digits in the third quarter. Obviously, a slightly easier comp versus where we were with the trucker strike, which partially hit us in the third quarter last year. But again, as I look at Brazil, and quite frankly, Latin America, good pricing, good volume, following good pricing that we took in the second quarter of 2019. So after aggressive pricing, we saw volume come back very nicely across the region. And we think that really bodes well for the underlying health of Latin America, specifically Brazil looks pretty good. Mexico, on the other hand, a little softer. We saw a little softness in the quarter versus what we've seen in the first half of the year. I think there is some uncertainty in terms of politically and economically where things are going there. Our strategy is the same. We're focused on premiumization. As I mentioned earlier, the total business is performing exceptionally well in that market. We're pushing naturals, natural ingredients into the portfolio as well. We've seen that as a significant ASP premium to the market. We are pushing sensitivity in that market. We have seen some nice growth on that as well. So overall, it's a premiumization strategy across the region. But as we see some of the markets slow, specifically Mexico, we will dial that up. Operator : And next, we'll go to Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi. Thank you for squeezing me in. If you can speak a little bit on Asia Pac, it showed the sequential improvement on the headline but not on a two-year stack. But particularly on the volumes, I think you kind of -- you inflected volumes there and you accelerated. Is that related to the -- can we read into the China destocking and improvement that you called about in the second half? Is that how you see? Is that according to plan? Anything you'd call out on China or Asia Pac in particular? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Andrea. Yes, we're pleased. Obviously, as John mentioned, with Asia, it's a little ahead of our expectations. We saw growth across every one of our hubs. It was broad-based and strong in terms of volume and price. And we feel that the momentum we have across Asia will continue. The particular call out was China. Obviously, a journey to get here, and we feel the strategies we've put in place in terms of our go-to-market changes, our portfolio changes, how we're working across the different retail environments, particularly online and the structural changes that we made in that organization are all starting to pay off, as we saw China deliver its first positive organic since Q4 of 2017. So again, it's been a while to get there, but we feel we're in a very good place and we'll continue to see that growth accelerate as we move into the fourth quarter and as we look at the 2020 plans, we would certainly hope to see that business continuing to grow. We realize that a lot of our competitors are getting significant growth out of China, so this bodes well that we continue to see our business accelerate and the strategies that we've put in place are starting to work. Operator : Moving on, we'll go to Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Two questions, I guess. One is just on Hill's. Maybe talk about how you're thinking about sustainability? Maybe was there any benefit from incremental channel fill from some of the new product launches in the U.S. in particular and just kind of how you're thinking about that? And then back to gross margin, I guess I'm a little surprised. You're surprised at what happened in the quarter. You talked about taking pricing on Hill's early in the quarter, so you had some idea there. It seems that there was going to be some pressure. North America was the category that had the -- geography that had the most pressure kind of in your backyard. So, when we were on the phone at the end of July, I mean, how much of this did you know at that point? What kind of visibility, then do you have at this point to tell us that you expect improvement in 4Q and going forward? Noel Wallace : So, let me talk about the sustainability in the Hill's business first, then we'll talk about pricing and margins again. Obviously, on Hill's, that business is hitting on all cylinders right now. They're expanding our presence in store, I think because the trade sees the sell-ins of the brand and how important it is to consumers in terms of how we're positioning the brand itself, and the messaging and the benefits that come with that. The pricing has stuck. The pricing you mentioned, Mark, was not in the second quarter. We've just taken pricing in the fourth quarter. So at the end of September, we took additional round of pricing on both our Hill's Science Diet business as well as the prescription diet business. So, that will hit us more in the fourth quarter, as we see the benefits of that coming through the P&L. We're in the midst of rolling out the Science Diet business globally. We've started in Latin America. It's moving into Asia in Japan, as well as Europe. And we've seen the early indications are like we've seen in U.S., so that bodes well for the sustainability of that business moving forward. What I also mentioned earlier is that we have really dialed up our innovation and are focused on the prescription diet part of the business, which is, you'll start to see those plans unfold in 2020. And we're certainly confident that, that business is going to continue to drive good results. Obviously, the quarter was exceptional. I'm not suggesting we're going to see double-digit growth in the fourth quarter or 2020 but we will see good strong growth as well as margin expansion as we move into 2020. Listen, on the mix issue, it was surprise for us, Mark. If you look back historically, we've always had positive or no impact on mix relative to our business. We saw some geographic issues. We saw some category issues in the quarter and we didn't anticipate that as we moved in -- as we moved through the second quarter discussion. As we moved into the quarter, it looked fine. As we went through the balance of the quarter, it got a little bit more challenging. And so we're on that. We are addressing that and have the right discussions with the teams moving forward. We, obviously, are a little bit more FX-ed that came through the P&L, than expected as well. That was a surprise to us. We were all hopeful that given the strong FX hits that we had last year, that we would see a more benign environment that picked up in the quarter. The good news is that's dropped back and we see spot rates coming back today. And we're hopeful that those spot rates will hold. But the surprise there was both mix and FX, and as I mentioned earlier, some of the raw packing materials that we saw come through the P&L as well. Operator : And I'd like to turn it back to our presenters for any additional or closing comments. Noel Wallace : No, thanks. Again, I appreciate the questions. We're on the gross margin discussion. 90 days through the quarter, we'll get that addressed moving forward. Obviously, the top-line sequential growth looks terrific for the business. It's broad-based across all of our categories, as well as both emerging and developed markets. As we look to the first quarter, we will come back to you with, obviously, a lot more specificity in terms of guidance for 2020. Let me again thank the 35,000 Colgate people who have worked so hard to deliver that sequential growth in the P&L, which looks terrific. And we look forward to continue discussions as we move into the fourth quarter and first quarter call. Thanks so much. Operator : And it does conclude today\u2019s conference. We would like to thank everyone for their participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to today's Colgate-Palmolive Company Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, John Faucher. Please go ahead John. John Faucher : Thanks, Aaron. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings all available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me this morning are Noel Wallace, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Henning Jakobsen Chief Financial Officer. I will begin with some thoughts on our performance in 2019, before moving to our 2020 guidance. We made meaningful progress in 2019 on our path to returning to sustainable profitable growth. As we said at the beginning of 2019, we increased investment behind our brands and in the capabilities that are required to deliver growth in our changing global markets. We also implemented changes in how we work to streamline our processes and drive empowerment to make us faster. Those strategic choices have started to pay off. As in 2019, we delivered net sales growth in excess of our initial guidance and organic sales growth at the high-end of our initial 2019 guidance range of 2% to 4% and within our long-term target range of 3% to 5%. On a non-GAAP basis, we delivered earnings per share within the guidance range we gave you at the beginning of the year, while our GAAP earnings per share were in excess of initial guidance. Our free cash flow was up 7% in 2019, due to improved working capital performance and discipline on capital spending. We delivered this performance despite some headwinds from economic uncertainty in markets like Mexico, Brazil and India. And importantly, we delivered on our commitment to return to growth in China, delivering organic sales growth in both the third and fourth quarters. So how do we drive better growth in 2019? Our continued focus on innovating around the core of our business, driving growth in adjacent segments, and expanding our availability in faster growth markets and channels is paying off. We successfully re-launched several of our core franchises. On Colgate Total, we delivered that brand's fastest organic sales growth in several years led by key markets like the U.S., Brazil and Mexico. Sales continues to deliver strong growth with major contributions coming from the Science Diet re-launch. In North America, Hill's delivered double-digit growth in Q4, while cycling a double-digit comparison in the year-ago period. We have more core innovation to come in 2020, especially on key oral care and personal care brands. Our performance in faster-growing adjacencies has been a significant contributor to our improvement in 2019. We delivered growth with new products that appeal to consumers' preferences for products that are more natural and sustainable. We have driven sales and market share growth with our charcoal toothpaste and bamboo toothbrush launches around the world and Sanex Zero% continues to grow as well. In skin health, EltaMD and PCA skin both achieved double-digit sales growth for the year. We acquired Filorga in Q3 and we are excited to announce that earlier today we closed our acquisition of the Hello Oral Care brand. These acquisitions should also contribute to growth going forward. A quick note on Filorga, we are currently reporting Filorga on a one-month lag. So the fourth quarter includes Filorga results only from the closing of the deal in mid-September through the end of November. When we transition Filorga to SAP, we will line up our reporting calendars. Our focus on availability in the faster-growth markets and channels has seen us deliver very strong growth in pharmacy, club, cash and carry and especially e-commerce. Our e-commerce organic sales grew 30% in 2019, and we established a new direct-to-consumer business with Hill's to Home, which provides a fast and easy way for veterinarians to sign patients up for prescription diet. It's a new subscription model that increases compliance. We're leveraging the learning's from Hill's new venture into our direct-to-consumer efforts across the rest of our business. We also made significant inroads on sustainability during the year. We launched the first of its kind recyclable toothpaste tube certified by the Association of Plastic Recyclers, which is now available in both Europe and North America. As of 2019, we have received TRUE Zero Waste certification on 16 facilities and we earned our highest recognition ever from the Dow Jones Worldwide Sustainability Index taking the lead in our industry sector for the first time. Our fourth quarter performance reinforces the progress that I just laid out. We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential acceleration in organic sales growth and we returned to gross margin expansion and delivered leverage on our overheads. On a GAAP basis, our gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was up 100 basis points. Excluding the impact of charges from our global growth and efficiency program and acquisition-related costs, our gross profit margin was up 80 basis points. For the fourth quarter, pricing was favorable to our gross margin by 60 basis points. Raw materials were unfavorable by 270 basis points, almost entirely offset by productivity from our funding the growth initiatives of 260 basis points. Other, primarily mix from Filorga was favorable by 30 basis points. Our advertising spending was up 13% for the fourth quarter, finishing up 6.5% for the full year. In the fourth quarter, excluding the charges from our global growth and efficiency program and advertising, our SG&A was down 70 basis points year-over-year as we benefited from operating leverage, productivity savings and lower logistics costs. So as we close the door on 2019, our focus is to advance on this progress through 2020. For 2020, we expect net sales growth of 4% to 6%, driven by organic sales growth in the 3% to 5% range, consistent with our long-term targets, a 1% to 2% benefit from the acquisitions of Filorga and Hello and a modest negative impact from foreign exchange. We expect gross profit margin expansion in 2020 driven by the underlying business as well as the mix benefits from Filorga. We expect positive pricing and the continued strength of our productivity initiatives to more than offset modest raw materials inflation. We will continue to invest behind our brands to maintain organic sales growth, not just in terms of advertising, which we expect to be up year-over-year, but also in building key growth capabilities in areas like innovation and data and analytics. We expect to drive leverage through the rest of our cost base through a combination of topline growth, cost discipline, productivity and mix. These investments are crucial not only to sustain organic sales growth, but also to get our market shares growing again. Our growth in non-measured channels is very strong and this is a key part of the strategy we've talked about all through 2019. And we are focused on improving our overall share performance. This is particularly true in North America, where we think a share turnaround in track channels is still a few quarters away. Accelerating our innovation efforts, particularly in premium segments will be the key factor in delivering better market shares. Interest expense should be up slightly in the year due to the increased debt from Filorga and the Hello transactions. We expect our tax rate to be between 24.5% and 25.5% on both a GAAP basis and excluding acquisition costs. On a GAAP basis, based on current spot rates, we are planning for a mid to high single-digit increase in earnings per share. Excluding charges resulting from the global growth and efficiency program, acquisition-related costs, the benefit from a value-added tax matter in Brazil and the benefit from Swiss income tax reform in 2019, based on current spot rates, we are planning for a low to mid single-digit increase in earnings per share. At this point, it seems certain that there will be a negative impact from the coronavirus on our businesses in China and the total company for at least the first quarter. While we expect it to be temporary, it is still too early to quantify the impact. And therefore, this has not been included in our guidance. We expect to be in a position to provide an update at CAGNY as well as on our first quarter call. We believe our plan for this year appropriately balances our improved performance, our need to sustain organic sales growth, our focus on driving cost out of our P&L and the uncertainties that exist in a fairly volatile world. And here to give you his thoughts on 2020 is Noel. Noel Wallace : Thanks, John, and Happy New Year, everyone. As John discussed, we made meaningful progress in 2019. We grew volume in organic sales in every division. We delivered organic sales growth in all four of our categories, Oral Care, Personal Care, Home Care and Pet Nutrition. In our Oral Care, business we grew organic sales mid-single digits in the year, led by our toothpaste business. And we closed out the year with our highest quarterly rate of organic sales growth in more than three years. But we know we're in 2020 now and we have more work to do. So here are my thoughts on our top three priorities for this year. The first is premium innovation to drive growth. We delivered successful innovation last year by focusing on our core adjacencies and new channels, but markets, categories, consumer preferences are changing and premium is winning, still a lot of opportunity for us in whitening, lifestyle, therapeutic, new forms in pet like wet and importantly in products that are more sustainable and more natural. We're deeply excited about the Hello acquisition given the potential we see for that brand on top of our core business. And obviously skin health is a big area of opportunity for us. Lastly, while we've improved our speed of innovation, we need to get faster. We are aggressively cutting the time it takes innovation to reach the market and you'll see that play out over 2020. Our second priority is becoming more digital and data-driven in everything we do commercially. Continuing on innovation to get faster, we need to use digital tools to replace our traditional testing methods in order to speed up our innovation. We're using analytics to more effectively target our digital spending and drive a higher ROI. We're accelerating our e-commerce business by becoming more data-driven. We're sharing learning across our businesses and geographies and we're co-locating Colgate and Hill's businesses to share best practices and drive efficiencies. And finally, delivering productivity across the P&L through new ways of working. Digital plays a part here as well. Projects like our global move to S/4HANA will allow us to simplify and standardize processes and move resources toward areas that drive real growth. In our supply chain, we have opportunities for more automation and robotics to drive more savings and we're enhancing our productivity culture, so our Colgate employees can continue to deliver our best-in-class funding the growth program, along with tackling other cost opportunities to drive efficiencies. So, those are our top three priorities we're focused on for 2020, more premium innovation to drive our growth, digital and data to make us faster and smarter, productivity to drive our margins. And now I'll be happy to take any questions. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, today\u2019s question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically for the telephone audience. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Steve Strycula with UBS. Steve Strycula : Hi, good morning. So my first question would be is how should we think about with the inclusion of new brands such as Hello, how do we think about your ability to manage category assortment within oral care as you kind of build this forward? I think John mentioned a desire to premiumize some of the North American business in his prepared remarks. So how do we think about names say Colgate returning to growth in the United States and balancing that with growth platforms such as Hello and Tom\u2019s? Noel Wallace : Yeah, Steve thanks, and good morning. So, clearly as you look at our portfolio around the world, we have had a history of managing multiple brands and doing it quite successfully. Obviously the Tom's brand here in the U.S. has been a successful growth driver over the last couple of years. And what's so exciting about the Hello brand is given its positioning it really complements our entire portfolio extraordinarily well. It's obviously on a lifestyle type brand and a free form type positioning SKUs are very high amongst millennials and Gen Z where some of our other brands don't perform now. So as we look to manage this brand particularly in North America and around the world, we think it's uniquely positioned in terms of delivering incremental growth to the core franchise. As we saw in 2019, we continue to accelerate oral care growth across the business. And last year it was one of the better years we've had on oral care particularly in toothpaste. And so we're very excited about what Hello is going to bring to the business. We've shown historically we know how to integrate acquisitions and run brands and portfolios with multiple brands in them and that will be the case for us in 2020 with Hello. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks. Good morning. So very interesting that you did not give a gross margin target for 2020. So I wanted to know if you could just address that change if we should think about that as maybe being a bit of a different approach at Colgate, whereas, gross margins has always been held up as a must have. So if you can just talk a little bit about that that would be great. Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. Good morning, Lauren. Listen, there's a lot of unpredictability in the world we live in today, a lot of volatility whether it be raw and packed materials, whether it be foreign exchange, a lot of mix play, a lot of geography mix play as well. And while we still have laser focus on driving gross margin and as John outlined in his commentary, we plan to grow gross margins in 2020, we felt it was important to really focus on the continued priority, which is driving top line growth and delivering the EPS guidance that we provided to The Street this morning. As far as gross margins go, we believe the mix opportunities that we have, obviously, bringing brands like Hello into the business, the skin care focus we have, all of those complementing our productivity, funding the growth initiatives will allow us to continue to accelerate gross margins. Operator : We'll take our next question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hi, good morning guys. Noel Wallace : Good Morning. Dara Mohsenian : So we've seen a clear rebound in organic sales growth of the company. But so far it's been a bit uneven with pet and emerging markets businesses accelerating substantially both for the full year but also in Q4, but not a strong results in North America and Europe. So I was just hoping you could compare and contrast the impact from your strategy changes on those two separate areas. Is there anything you've learned in emerging markets and pet you can apply to North America and Europe? And any green shoots there in North America, Europe or when at least should we expect to see improvement particularly in light of the comments that the track channels in North America may take some time to turn? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Thanks Dara. So let's take a step back on the overarching strategy that we've been deploying over the last 12 to 18 months, which is obviously focused on our core, driving adjacencies and exploring and operating differently with our new -- with different channels. And you've seen that obviously play out in the acceleration of organic growth. And as we said in the upfront statements, we accelerated growth across all of our geographies, all of our divisions in that regard and obviously all of our categories. So we think the underlying strategy on how we're executing that around the world is doing quite well. Now, obviously, as you pull out different geographies, Europe categories are a bit slower, different competitive base. Obviously we've got a very strong business there with both the Colgate franchise and the all mix franchise. And the strategy that we just articulated we are executing really well there. Shares are pretty good across Europe on our business. And as we talked about earlier, Total performed very, very well particularly in the U.K., which is one of our largest markets. So overall we're optimistic on where we see Europe going relative to some of the strategies we're deploying. But bear in mind, the categories aren't growing nearly as fast in Europe as they are in the rest of the world. Categories in emerging markets are basically in our categories growing at about 2 times to the developed part of the world. So again, you would expect both North America and Europe to be at a slower pace in terms of top line growth. Relative to North America, obviously there's a lot of work being done from the team on how we're turning around that business. We're currently not at the potential that we see for that business as we speak. We're very, very focused on transforming how we think about innovation. There'll be a lot more focus on premium as we go throughout the year. Most of that will be back-half weighted. The team under John looks leadership is really rethinking on how we look at innovation from a structure standpoint, how we look at it from a premium standpoint and we have some good R&D technologies coming down the pipeline that we think will continue to accelerate growth. But we're going to fix North America the right way. Obviously, we're disappointed with the progress that we made in the fourth quarter, but I have to say based on the plans I've seen, we're really encouraged on where they're going. We're not going to buy our share back. We're going to do things in terms of making sure that we have long-term sustainable growth in that business and driving the premium piece of the business is the key focus. Operator : We'll move next to Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good morning folks and happy belated new year. Noel Wallace : Hi, Jason. Jason English : I guess, I want to come back to one of the pieces that Dara highlighted that's performed well and that's pet food. Really impressive growth. I guess the key question is one of durability because it's been -- it's been a long time since we've seen this type of growth. We are hearing from tractor supply yesterday and I know they're not the hugest retailer, but they're one of the more vocal ones that they're looking to reset their shelves and give some brands that have turned positive more space, give some of the legacy grain-free brands less space. Are you seeing that same shift? And do you expect it to bet at you? And is it a reason to believe that we can continue to see this type of momentum as we track to 2020? Noel Wallace : Yes. Listen, we're obviously very pleased as you've seen in the numbers with Hill's. And this harkens back to kind of the cornerstone of our strategy across the company which is focusing on the core, which we've seen terrific growth on Science Diet as we rolled out across North America. We will be rolling the Science Diet relaunch, we started in the late 2019 in Europe and that will expand to the rest of the world in 2020. We looked at adjacencies obviously, as we're getting into the core. And the channel expansion that we had both in farm and feed as well as e-commerce, really sits well with how confident we are with the strategy that we're executing around the world. Now specifically on the durability of that business aside from the fact that they continue to have a strong pipeline of innovation coming the Science Diet rollout will go throughout the rest of the world in 2020. Take the U.S. as an example. We delivered double-digit growth in the fourth quarter on the Hill's business last year and we delivered another double-digit growth this year in fourth quarter, so given the size of that business, I think a clear indication that the durability is there. Now there's no question the comps will get more difficult as we move forward. So we need to continue to focus on the things that we do really well which is the innovation piece of the business, executing against new channels and exploring new adjacencies, which I mentioned in some of my up growth comments about the opportunities we see in wet moving forward. Operator : We'll move next to Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, good morning everyone. So I wanted to know if you can explore more -- you took us through Europe in a bit of North America. But as embedded in your guidance, you're thinking of a more balanced growth in between North America and developing markets. And if you can also elaborate a little bit more obviously we've got the coronavirus impact, but the Asia Pacific volumes have been coming back since March quarter since the third quarter and then the fourth quarter. And if you continue to see momentum there. And in LatAm, if you can still see a more balanced volume pricing growth as you roll out the more premium products there? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Thanks. So let's talk a little bit about emerging markets. As you well know, we do 70% more or less 70% of our revenues outside the U.S. So we're very focused on emerging markets. And as I mentioned earlier, the emerging market growth rates at least in our core categories are growing at a healthy pace above where we see the developed part of the world moving. So organic growth of 5% in emerging on the year versus 3% in developing obviously is consistent with what we'd like to see the profile of our organic growth moving forward given the strength that we have in emerging markets. Latin America specifically doing well, Mexico doing well in Brazil. Categories are in the 4% to 5% rate there. We should -- obviously there's some uncertainty on where Mexico is going given the fact that they are technically in a recession. And macroeconomics in Brazil seem to be improving. We'll see how that unfolds over time. But the business is quite solid in Latin America and the category seem to be holding up pretty well. Moving on to Asia. Obviously very pleased with another quarter of organic growth and we seem to be getting on track. But as we've said, the turnaround in Asia is going to be -- is going to take some time. While we saw good growth in the back half of the year, this is a long-term strategy that we're executing in Asia to get the portfolio right, to get the go-to-market right and get the innovation structure right, particularly as we look at how we innovate on the growing e-commerce channel. The coronavirus there's not much more to add on that. First and foremost, we're very pleased that all of our employees are safe. We are very focused on that. We have mobilized the supply chain to look at all contingency planning relative to production should the implications of the virus extend beyond the current dates. And we're intending to come back to everyone with more information at CAGNY. Africa is one we don't talk about a lot. Obviously, we had issues in that business 18 to 24 months ago. You've seen I think the durability of the strategy play out in the Africa numbers, where we've seen consistent growth. Importantly, one of our largest markets South Africa had a good back half. And so the categories as well as our business in that important geography seem to be performing quite well. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Great. Thanks. Maybe first just to clean up on North America. I know you said, you wouldn't buy your way back to share strength. But the pricing and profitability there this quarter just came in below our expectations. So maybe you could help unpack what happened in the quarter and whether that will carry over until at least the first half of 2020? My main question more broadly, just if you could maybe just the play across your skin care businesses and that category has been accelerating. Just would love a little bit more context from you about how your various brands are performing against expectations. And then also just a comment on your appetite to do more in skin care, whether prioritizing organic investment maybe expanding brands like Tom's or even Hello in that direction? Or obviously pursuing additional M&A? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. Sure, Steve. On the pricing bear in mind that in the fourth quarter of last year we were not promoting quite frankly at all across most of our toothpaste franchise given the preparation for the launch of Total. So the comps were obviously very difficult for us in the fourth quarter this year versus where they were in the fourth quarter last year. We also had a bit of mix both in the category and the channel mix that impacted the margins in the quarter. Moving forward, as John mentioned in his comments, the work that we're doing to prepare for long-term sustainable growth in the U.S. consistent with our strategy and very focused particularly in the U.S. around premium innovation, most of that will kick in, in the back half of 2020. Relative to skin care, we're very pleased. You heard in the upfront comments those businesses are growing double-digits and we intend to continue to focus and accelerate our investment in those categories as we move through the balance of 2020. And they've got a good innovation pipeline and we're obviously very carefully thinking about our expansion into new geographies. What we do see is significant upside in the geographies in which we currently compete. Obviously, China is a big piece of the skin care business both for Elta and for Filorga, so we'll have to \u2013 we're on a wait and see in terms of the impact of the coronavirus on our business there. Filorga, specifically has a good travel retail business, so we'll see how that unfolds moving forward. And as it relates to M&A, listen we've got between Elta PCA and Filorga, we think the right skin care assets right now. Obviously, if something came across that really got our attention then we would consider it. And with the acquisition of Hello, we're tremendously excited in terms of the growth potential there. We think we're right where we need to be in terms of M&A but never say never. Operator : We'll take our next question from Nik Modi with RBC. Nik Modi : Yes, good morning, everyone. I was hoping you can provide some compare and contrast. I mean, Hill's has been doing very well after struggling for a bit. And so I just wanted to hear your thoughts on what happened to Hill's and kind of how you think about the core Oral Care business in terms of kind of the progression and evolution of some of the strategies that you've been putting in place? Noel Wallace : Sure. Again relative to the strategy that we're deploying across the world which is core adjacencies and channels, Hill's is hitting on all cylinders in that regard. The other important area that we see that they have a unique advantage in is how they're thinking about the business digitally and how we're focused very much on now embracing analytics to use to drive our e-commerce business, which was incidentally up almost 40% in the quarter. So they're hitting on all the right things right now and they've got obviously good growth plans moving forward. But as I've said, the comps get more difficult. The good news is obviously the prescription diet business, which is an important part of that business. We have strong innovation coming down in 2020 and we think we're well positioned, obviously given some of the impacts of the recall that we had in 2019 to recover from that moving forward. Obviously relative to the learnings we have on Hill's, as I mentioned, likewise in my upfront comments, we're seeing great benefits by combining our teams, particularly around digital and e-commerce on the ground to share learnings and really maximize efficiencies in terms of how we look at digital, how we buy digital and how we execute against the data that we're learning from Matt. Hill's is quite advanced in that and sharing those learnings broadly across the Colgate business will pay dividends for us. Operator : We'll go next to Rob Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. I think you mentioned, e-commerce overall up 30%; Hill's almost 40%. Can you perhaps kind of just give us a sense of what's going on in e-commerce on the Oral Care side? And particularly, in the U.S. market and in China, what kind of growth rates you're seeing? What percentage of the business is e-commerce? Kind of initiatives you're doing? And most specifically on China you started to touch on it, but love to get a little bit more granularity in terms of whether you have the right brand portfolio, the right price points, whether it's a question of technology relationships with the large e-commerce providers to really get the Chinese e-commerce business rocking and rolling? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. So, pleased with e-commerce overall. As John mentioned, we were up 30% in the year. This is a fluid business that you continually bring new learnings and which is great about the business, because it's so data-driven, you're able to ascertain, what's working, what's not and act upon that pretty quickly. So we're thinking quite differently among how we structure ourselves around e-commerce with fully independent teams managing that business, so they can take -- that they're empowered to make decisions and taking those decisions very live rather than having to wait for that. So that's certainly benefiting us both on the oral care side or the Colgate side as well as Hill's side. The Colgate business was up significantly last year in the U.S., our e-commerce business was up just shy of 40%. Shares ticked up again. Remember we have a very strong Tom\u2019s of Maine business. Hello will come into the franchise now, which is quite strong on e-commerce as well. And the Colgate business is driving that nice growth. As we look at China specifically, we're starting to develop much more strategic relationships with some of the big platforms there, whether it be Alibaba or JD. We're looking at structuring ourselves differently in order to ensure that we're getting -- partnering with them in a very different way not only in terms of the data side of the business, but likewise on the innovation side of the business where we're going to need to really focus on the premium side, which I mentioned and collaborating with some of our big partners and having the flexibility to do things a bit more uniquely we think will bode well for the business moving forward. Operator : We'll take our next question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks. First on North America, just as you think about the remediation actions you're taking there, what's your view on margins? Because they've obviously come in pretty dramatically. So you talked about the focus on premiumization. Do you think going forward the margin gets better because of the premiumization? Or is this sort of a certain level of investment is now here to stay. Noel Wallace : Thanks Olivia. Sure. Listen the margins improved in the fourth quarter obviously from where they were in the third quarter. As I talked about, we had some more difficult comparisons given the promotional environment a year ago. We have seen a little bit of a step-up in promotional in the toothpaste category particularly around couponing as we've seen some of our competitors increase their values in that space, but we'll manage that very carefully. As I mentioned earlier, our focus is getting back to durable sustainable growth and premium innovation is at the heart of that and the premium innovation will obviously be accretive to the margin as we move forward, as we continue to push the mix in that area. Obviously, the move towards naturals and lifestyle brands, Naturals with Tom\u2019s of Maine, which will increase the investment behind that business will help margins. The lifestyle brands like Hello, as we continue to push that business, which incidentally today only has a 9% awareness in the U.S. market. So as we put more investment behind that, and we continue to expand the distribution, obviously, that will play out nicely for the business as well. The advertising is meant to obviously create long-term sustainable growth for us and we've seen that obviously play out holistically and globally on the top line and North America will get its fair share as we continue to rebuild that business moving forward. But again, we're going to do that the right way focused on innovation and making sure that we're building the brands for the long-term. Operator : We go next to Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Question for you on the company's ability to drive greater leverage between the top line and earnings as we look beyond 2020. So clearly this was an investment year. You're getting the top line payback, which is encouraging, but EPS down mid single-digits as you look out to next year up low to mid single-digits relatively in line with the mid single-digit -- excuse me, low single -- excuse me, mid single-digit top line that you're guiding to organically. Understanding FX is a little bit of a component there a little bit of a headwind. But will investment levels be adequate for the company as best you can tell as you look at your budget and you look at your guidance now. So as you get beyond 2020, should the investment community expect a return to high single-digit EPS growth where you're able to get better leverage once investment levels are adequate? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks Steve. We're not going to obviously guide beyond 2020 at this stage. But let me talk a little bit about leverage and productivity and how we're thinking about it. First and foremost, as we've been very consistent with our strategy around reinvigorating top line growth and driving sustainable organic growth, you've seen that obviously sequentially through the last five quarters and the best leverage we're going to get through the P&L is as we deliver the top line. Obviously, we'll see where foreign exchange goes. We believe it will be a little less punishing than it has been in the past this year. But again, with the unpredictability of the environments that we compete we shall see. As I mentioned in the upfront beyond premium innovation, which will obviously drive the top line and the leverage through the P&L, we are very, very focused on productivity across the entire P&L. We have a list of projects that we're thinking through. We're obviously looking at productivity delivered through technology and the discussions I had around S4 and on how we leverage the simplification efforts that will come from that and the standardization that will come from that. So we're very focused on that. The supply chain, likewise, looking as I mentioned to use robotics and automation very differently moving forward. We're looking at segmentation of our facilities around the world to drive more efficiencies in the plants. So, productivity is right in our focus right now. And as we drive the top line, we'll see that productivity move through the P&L. Most of that productivity particularly for North America we'll see that coming through in the back half of 2020. Operator : We move next to Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Thanks and good morning, everybody. Wanted to ask about Hello kind of specifically in M&A strategy broadly. So, what does Hello give you that you couldn't have done with your own brands? And I guess just more broadly, what's driving the increase in M&A over the last year or so as you've taken over? How do you describe the company's ability to handle digest multiple deals. And once I get that they're small but there's a lot more going on here than there has been. Thoughts on doing more deals. Can you take on more at this point potentially even something larger should that materialize? And maybe how do you think about the leverage targets although not necessarily specific to M&A but just kind of broadly since there's certainly not a lot of leverage on the balance sheet at this point? Noel Wallace : Yeah. So thanks Mark. So I mentioned upfront that markets are changing, categories are changing, consumers are changing, and we've seen that disruption certainly peak out very aggressively in Asia, and particularly China and we've seen a lot more of that in North America over the last 18 months. And so as we look at our business, we're obviously looking to position our brands in areas, where they can best compete. And as we look at our portfolio strategies, we obviously can't be a one brand for all particularly given the disruptions, you're seeing in the marketplace. And if we see the right opportunity for complementary brands within our portfolio, particularly in Oral Care, we will seek to go after those. And Hello was a perfect, perfect fit for us relative to its unique positioning in terms of millennials and Gen Z, which is not a strength of the Colgate franchise. It obviously complements it well \u2013 itself very well with Tom\u2019s. Hello is a very lifestyle-oriented brand, where Tom\u2019s is a very core natural-oriented brand, so we think it fits well and we're going to run the business independently. We're going to run the business differently and not bring it into the Colgate business. So we're very fortunate to have Craig and Lloyd coming over to the business. I think some of you have met them. You know the strength of their leadership. You know the strength of their marketing, instincts and how they think about brands. We fully intend to use both of them across the Colgate business around the world to help us think about innovation very, very differently. And I think Craig will be a wonderful ambassador for us as we think about, how we're transforming our innovation approach to the market. As I mentioned, earlier we're very comfortable with the M&A that we've made, where we continue to be able to deliver against those. We have a track record of delivering successfully against M&A. And I think the reason is we're very focused. We let the business run independently. We maintain their cultures, but we offer them all the opportunities to flex the Colgate machine so to speak relative to synergies, best-practices, training, you name it and that we'll continue to do that with Hello. Operator : We'll move next to Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Thanks. Good morning. Noel Wallace : Hey, Bill. Bill Chappell : I don't \u2013 taking a year to look back on the total re-launch especially in North America, but also kind of worldwide. I mean, what would be your grade of it just from the Super Bowl commercial to the money spent there. And I understand that it was in part done you needed to kind of restage the platform before you rolled out new products this year. But just trying to understand, especially in light of kind of the fourth quarter North American results how good \u2013 was this in line with expectations? Could the money been spent elsewhere? Just kind of your color would be great. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks, Bill. So listen we took a 10% price increase on that business and we held that price increase through the year. And if you take a big core franchise like Colgate Total that's probably the best pricing performance, we've had in the better part of the decade. So from a pricing standpoint, we're quite excited. And we've had the fastest growth on Colgate Total in over three years. So that in its own suggests that the relaunch was successful. Did we have slightly higher expectations in certain geographies? Sure. But our big markets like the U.K., like Brazil, like Mexico where we have high shares we did very well in North America perhaps delivered against our expectation. Our volume share was okay. But recall, we downsized that brand and perhaps we would have done a little bit differently given some of the learning's we have through the launch. But overall, it drove the brand, it drove the equity, and we had a good year on oral care. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hey guys, thanks. So regarding your 2020 guidance, I'd love to better understand the lack of top-line growth leveraging into your bottom line. And if you back it out, it feels like it would suggest something like another up to 100 basis points call it maybe 75 basis points of reinvestment into the business again in 2020. And so in that context, I'd love to get a sense of how you assess the return on that spend given what you've seen so far in 2019 particularly on market share. The market share continues to decline as you put it out in your press release not getting better. You still have the U.S., Brazil, Mexico, France, China, India kind of your core areas still losing share. So love to hear how you think about the returns in that overall context? Noel Wallace : Good. Well, let me take the latter part of your question first. I think the returns and the results Ali, obviously, a 5% organic in the fourth quarter, sequentially up from the fourth. And as we've discussed and you have highlighted that for quite some time the need to continue to invest behind the business. We think we've that played out relative to the organic performance that we delivered. On the 2020 guide, obviously, just a couple of mechanics through the P&L, the Filorga as a full year on a percent of sales advertising, obviously, much higher and adding a bit to the overall advertising line. But as we mentioned upfront, we have a strong focus on premium innovation and we want to continue to accelerate the investment behind our brands and our businesses in order to deliver long-term sustainable growth. It's early days right now. Obviously we've got a lot of work to do this year. It's only January, a lot can change relative to the macros. You see a lot of uncertainty. We'll see where China plays out. Brazil, Mexico likewise as I mentioned earlier, India a little bit of softness obviously in the real markets we're seeing. So we think the guidance from where we are today and where we sit is absolutely appropriate in terms of how we're thinking about the business. And as we move throughout the year, we'll continue to update that as necessary. Operator : We'll take our final question today from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Oh, great. Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on Asia in general, not seeking about outlook for China and coronavirus in particular at all. But when you look back, Asia had the best volume performance I think since 2015 and the best pricing performance in 2014. So just at a holistic level if you could talk a little bit about, sort of, again ex-coronavirus sustainability and what types of things have really triggered that uptick and if you're thinking about that as being like a new base level for the performance you can have out of the region? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Thanks Lauren. There was also an earlier question on our portfolio in China. I remind the audience that we, obviously, have the Colgate franchise and the Darlie franchise that delivers our leadership market position in China. Both those businesses continue to perform well, particularly the Darlie business came back nicely in the fourth quarter. Was able to launch again focused on our strategy, premium innovation particularly around some -- you'll be surprised to hear baking soda products have now become very, very popular in China and are being sold at premium prices and that's certainly helped deliver not only the pricing but the volume. On the Colgate side as I mentioned earlier we're in the midst of a long-term turnaround here. We still got a lot of work to do relative to that business. We're pleased with where we saw the business perform. We had a good 11/11 again behind premium pricing. Our miracle repair product, our volcanic products that we launched in the quarter delivered good volume and good pricing. As you look outwards, obviously, we'll see the impact of corona and what happens in China, it's going to be very difficult at this point to predict the sustainability of where we are right now given the implications of that. But we're certainly structuring ourselves and putting the fundamentals in place to deliver long-term sustainable growth in those markets. Operator : And at this time, I'll turn it back to management for any additional or closing remarks. Noel Wallace : So, no, thank you everyone. Obviously we'll see everyone at CAGNY. I look forward to having more discussions there. And for all the Colgate people that are listening, let me wholeheartedly thank you for your incredible support and work for the last year and we look forward to your continued focus in 2020. Thanks everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded and is being broadcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now, for opening remarks, I would like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, John Faucher. Please go ahead. John Faucher : Thanks, Mary. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in table six of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Please note that starting today in both the press release and the conference call, we are now using the term Base Business to refer to non-GAAP measures that exclude certain items in both the current and year ago periods.  Joining me on the call this morning from their homes are; Noel Wallace, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Henning Jakobsen, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will start off with his thoughts on the current operating environment, and how we are adapting to the uncertainty about COVID-19 and the economy. I will then discuss our Q1 performance and provide some context around 2020 before opening it up for Q&A. Given the busy conference calls scheduled today, we request that you limit yourselves to one question so that as many people as possible get to ask the question. If you have further questions, you are welcomed to re-enter the queue. Now, I'll turn it over to Noel. Noel Wallace : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. First, I hope that you and your families are safe and well during these unprecedented times. Obviously, we're operating in a difficult environment, and we expect things to stay difficult for some time. But there's one thing you should know about Colgate-Palmolive and the 34,000 people at the heart of our company, we're at our best when times are difficult. I want to thank all of the Colgate people around the world, many of whom are listening to this call, who have scaled enormous obstacles to keep our business running and to deliver the results that we reported today. We thrive in difficult times because we are at the heart, a local company with global brands and strategies and best-in-class execution. Our locally based operating model, financial discipline and sound balance sheet helped to position Colgate to emerge from this crisis an even stronger company. We produce and sell products that people rely on every single day to keep themselves and their families, including their pets, safe and healthy. Our responsibility to our employees, our customers, our consumers and our communities has never been greater. We treat this responsibility with the utmost seriousness and intend to do our best for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. That said, and despite strong Q1 results, we have chosen to withdraw our annual guidance for 2020. This was not an easy decision for us. However, given the combined uncertainty surrounding the future impact to COVID-19 and government actions to stem the spread of the virus, we believe this is the correct choice. The second and third order effects of this crisis through economic stress to our supply chain, retail partners and consumers are difficult to predict at this point, particularly as they're intertwined. As we proceed through the year, we hope to provide you with updated guidance when it proves feasible. In that light, I want to focus on what we are -- how we are managing through the crisis to give you the context for what we're facing, but also some confidence in how we are meeting this head on. I'll discuss three topics; how staying true to our values and purpose is helping us navigate this environment, how we're adapting our strategies and executing with agility and how we are managing through the crisis with an eye towards the future. Staying true to our values and purpose is vital in the current environment as it impacts both our people and our brands. Our number one priority around the world is the health and safety of our Colgate people and their families. In order to deliver on that, we have to implement many policies and procedures to enhance health and safety standards within the company. We have advanced our safety and screening protocols and made adjustments to our work processes to support social distancing. Where possible, we're expanding these policies to our third-party partners. Additionally, we are expanding our health and wellness programs for our people, including counseling, paid time off to care for family members and flexible schedules to adapt to changing family circumstances. We have talked to you a lot over the past years about brand purpose and consumers' preference for brands to give them something to buy into. The results we have seen in the marketplace show that consumers are responding to this crisis by focusing on trusted brands. Our marketing teams have created new programs and adapting existing ones to lean into our brand purpose. At the beginning of the year, we began to roll out a new equity campaign for Colgate Toothpaste based on the inherent optimism of the brand. The central idea is powerful, using Colgate Toothpaste gives people the confidence to smile on regardless of the challenges or questions they face. We've adapted this campaign in digital settings to highlight how important smiles are in a world where we can't be with the people most important to us. So these days, you just smile, whether on Google Hangouts, Zoom or FaceTime, that lets people know that you feel -- well, lets people know how you feel about them. We know handwashing is a first-line of defense against the coronavirus, and we're very proud of our work with the World Health Organization to promote handwashing by distributing 25 million free bars of soap. We initiated this program to support WHO's #SafeHands campaign and are partnering with Save the Children in care to distribute the product, particularly in emerging markets where the need is most acute. We're also donating $20 million worth of health and hygiene products to help consumers in hard hit areas. In New York City, our hometown, we've been donating product to health care workers and first responders all over the city. The second topic is executing our strategy with even greater agility. The strategy that we have discussed with you over the past two years is working as evidenced by our reacceleration in organic sales growth during that time. But we know that simply executing our existing plans isn't enough. We need to be even more agile in this new world. We are still focused on our core brands, innovation in faster-growth segments and expansion in high-growth channels and markets. While we will make some shifts in priorities and timings, our key focus areas do not need to change. Delivering on our core brands will be vital over the foreseeable future. Consumers want to know that the products they are buying are effective and provide good value. This aligns with our portfolio as our core brands are often at base and mainstream price points, which we expect to become bigger focus areas for retailers and consumers as the economic pressures have increased unemployment mount. Our core innovation strategy will bring news to these big segments and is intended to bring added value in a period where price increases may be difficult to take. We will also continue to focus on innovation in faster-growth segments. Our plans for 2020 and 2021 will still include significant premium innovation as it is often innovation that drives store traffic. As part of our efforts to expand our business in faster-growth channels, we have focused even more aggressively on e-commerce and direct-to-consumer. This was the learning that we took from our experiences in China in the first quarter, which helped us to shift resources towards channels that will benefit from disruption in our markets. We saw significant e-commerce share gains in toothpaste in the US in the first quarter behind the launch of Optic White Renewal. And Hill's worked with their brick-and-mortar partners to accelerate their e-commerce offerings in order to offset lost store traffic. Overall, our e-commerce business was up more than 50% in the first quarter. And our North American division e-commerce sales more than doubled in the quarter versus prior year. Our professional teams have learned new ways to engage their customers in a socially distant world. Similar to what we do with Hill's to Home, PCA Skin is helping their spa customers by having them book orders for direct-to-consumer shipments so they can still drive revenue. But agility isn't just executing our strategy the same way we had planned. In this current environment, it requires streamlining our processes and making decisions more quickly so that we can get better respond to our customers and consumers' needs. There's no better example of this than our global supply chain. As the crisis hit, we mobilized our supply chain teams to offset lost production in China to increase manufacturing elsewhere. We established strict safety procedures in China, which allowed us to reopen our factories in a safe and efficient manner. Now, we are operating at over 100% of our expected capacity in many of our Chinese plants, which is helping to alleviate pressure in countries where COVID is still a developing problem. By taking these procedures around the globe, we helped our Anzio, Italy plant stay open throughout the crisis, delivering 40% more volume in March than initially anticipated. After realizing the scale of the increased demand for many of our health and hygiene products, our marketing and customer development teams worked with our retail partners to develop streamlined product offerings that allow our supply chain to produce fewer SKUs for longer runs, which increased capacity to meet consumer demand. We also identified alternative formulas, materials, packaging designs and product artwork to give us flexibility as we prepare for further disruption in our networks. We have also become more digitally oriented by transitioning 10,000 people to work outside the office. Thanks to the resilience of our global networks, our quarterly closing process is one of the smoothest in memory despite the fact that all of our shared service centers in Mexico City, Warsaw and Mumbai, all working 100% remotely. And all of this happened in just nine weeks since I presented to you at the CAGNY conference. This great work has helped us deliver the results that we reported today. This proven capacity for agility will continue as we encounter ongoing impacts from the crisis, economic uncertainty and foreign exchange headwinds. Our third priority is balancing how we manage to get through the crisis, ensuring that we can win when it's over. We have established our -- we have re-established our top line momentum over the past two years. We need to sustain that momentum and adapt our financial plans to deliver in a very difficult 2020, while leaving ourselves well positioned for growth when markets normalize. We will continue to support our brands through impactful marketing programs. We know that compelling advertising behind strong brands is crucial to maintaining long-term organic sales growth, which is the key value driver for our company. We also need to further invest in the capabilities that are driving growth : digital, e-commerce and analytics. We will not fall behind in building the skills needed for when the economy comes back. Productivity is always a priority for us. And these times, we work even harder to take costs out of the P&L to help offset some of the additional pressure that will come from COVID mitigation, foreign exchange and the weakening economy. Our Funding the Growth initiatives, are ramping up to take out discretionary costs that may be unnecessary given the current business environment. We're using analytics to identify and eliminate promotional programs that are not generating value given the consumer environment we find ourselves in. I will finish up by reminding you of our strategies surrounding cash flow and liquidity, which remain unchanged. We have historically generated significant amounts of free cash flow, a trend that continued in the first quarter. Our priorities for uses of cash include capital investments for productivity and future growth; paying dividends to our shareholders, which we have done consistently for 124 straight years; and acquisitions to accelerate growth. We generally allocate the balance of our cash flow to share repurchase. Consistent with prior comments, we have moderated our share repurchase activity as we focus more of our cash flow on reducing the debt from the Filorga and Hello transactions. Turning to liquidity, we've been issuing commercial paper throughout the crisis. We remain committed to our AA minus debt rating. And as of the end of the first quarter, we have cash and cash equivalents on hand that are more than three times our long-term debt maturities over the next 12 months. We also have access to lines of credit should we need them. So those are our priorities. Although there is tremendous amount of uncertainty right now, I am confident that we have the right priorities, the right strategies and most of all, the right people, Colgate people to navigate through the crisis -- emerge stronger on the other side. And now I'll turn it over to John to discuss our Q1 results and provide some context on our full 2020. John Faucher : Thanks, Noel. We delivered strong -- operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow in Q1 2020 as we responded aggressively to the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe. We delivered a combination of volume and pricing growth, with organic sales growth across all four categories and in every division except for Asia Pacific, where China and India were negatively impacted by the pandemic. While pantry loading due to COVID-19 obviously, provided the benefit to the quarter, our sales and profit trends were strong through January and February. As Noel mentioned, our underlying growth strategies are working, and we believe they will continue to benefit us going forward even as we adapt to a new reality. On a GAAP basis, our gross profit margin was 60.2%, up 130 basis points year-over-year. On a base business basis, our gross profit margin for the quarter was 60.3%, which was up 110 basis points. Our gross profit margin was up in every division in the quarter. For the first quarter, pricing was 70 basis points favorable to gross margin, while raw materials were a 130 basis point headwind, including the transactional impact from foreign exchange. Productivity added 150 basis points. Mix was a 20 basis point benefit in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, our SG&A ratio was up 90 basis points as a percent to sales. On a base business basis, our SG&A ratio was up 100 basis points in the quarter driven by an increase in advertising to sales as our advertising spending was up 13% year-over-year. Excluding advertising, our SG&A was up slightly year-over-year driven by an increase in logistics costs as we work to meet heightened demand. On a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 8% year-over-year, while it was up 6% on a base business basis. Our EPS was up 28% on a GAAP basis and up 12% on a base business basis. As Noel mentioned, we delivered strong cash flow growth in the quarter, up 28% year-over-year due to net income growth, favorable working capital performance, lower tax payments and the lapping of a voluntary pension contribution in the year ago period. North America delivered strong growth in the quarter, aided by increased consumer demand across all categories, particularly liquid hand soap and dish soap and household cleaners. As Noel mentioned, we're particularly pleased with the performance of Colgate Optic White Renewal toothpaste, which is driving share gains for the Optic White franchise, both online and in brick-and-mortar. Latin America net sales were flat in the quarter as strong volume and pricing growth were offset by significant foreign exchange headwinds. All three categories delivered strong organic sales growth in the first quarter, led by Oral Care. Both Mexico and Brazil delivered a good mix of volume and pricing growth. Colgate Total delivered strong growth in the quarter, helping to drive our premium portfolio. Our digital marketing campaign that Noel mentioned has reached over 135 million users across multiple platforms with engagement and view-through rates well above CPG norms. Europe's double-digit net sales growth in the quarter was driven by 8% organic volume growth, the inclusion of Filorga, minus 1.5% pricing and negative foreign exchange. Europe's high single-digit organic volume growth was driven across all categories and every hub. Palmolive liquid hand soap and Ajax cleaning products drove strong sales growth across the division, while Sanex Body Wash reached peak market shares. In the U.K., our premium Toothpaste business behind Colgate Total and Colgate Max White Ultimate drove organic sales growth and market share gains for the Colgate brand. The first quarter was a difficult one for the Asia Pacific division. We saw a significant impact on China from the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the quarter, while India was impacted by a country-wide shut down that began in late March. In China, we have begun to see the country open back up. And trends are improving in Q2, but we caution that the country still is not back to pre-crisis levels. We continue to focus on innovation, particularly at premium price points in the e-commerce channel. Our Colgate Miracle Repair toothpaste with concentrated amino acid is the biggest driver of growth for Colgate's e-commerce business and has helped drive a more than 20% increase in average selling price for our e-commerce business in China. In India, we are still experiencing disruptions to both our supply chain and our retail network, consistent with what you have heard from other companies. Trends have started to improve, and our plants are beginning to ramp back up. But we still expect an impact from the crisis in the second quarter. In Africa Eurasia, our strong net sales and organic sales growth was driven by volume growth across every hub. Our focus on faster-growth channels continues to pay dividends, particularly in terms of discounters in Russia and Turkey. We saw a continued improvement in our South African business. Our Protex brand, which delivers anti-bacterial and anti-derm benefits, is uniquely positioned for the current environment and drove significant growth in Q1 in South Africa and many other markets around the world. And I'll finish off with Hill, which continues to deliver excellent results. Those remain an example of how execution of a consistent strategy around brand purpose, core innovation and a focus on faster-growth channels can deliver growth in any markets. Sales growth was led by North America, where continued double-digit growth before the pandemic was augmented by consumer pantry loading late in the quarter. The e-commerce business was up by more than 50% as we drove strong growth across all platforms. In Europe, Hill's delivered it\u2019s fastest net sales growth and organic sales growth in many years, with growth in advance of the impact of the crisis. Prescription diet drove the growth in the quarter, and we are beginning to see the benefit from the Science Plan relaunch. While we are not providing guidance, we want to provide some context around certain factors that you should consider as you work on your models for 2020. Our organic sales momentum continued into April, although foreign exchange continued to worsen as we benefited from the rebuilding of retail inventories and increased demand in certain categories, offset by weakness in some emerging markets. As we mentioned in the press release, based on current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a mid-single-digit negative impact on net sales for the full year. We now expect our tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22% on a GAAP basis, while on a base business basis, we now expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. Also, as Noel mentioned, we continue to plan for less benefit from share repurchase in the year as we focus more of our cash flow on reducing the debt from the Filorga and Hello transactions. And with that, Mary, can you open it up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We can take our first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. Good morning. Hope you\u2019re all well. So you mentioned a potential negative impact on forward category growth in this new environment. Noel, I was just hoping you could be a bit more specific on your expectations in some of the key emerging markets countries. Are we looking at potential magnitude that's significant in your minds or more modest, and perhaps you can compare and contrast the situation we saw in the last recession a little more than a decade ago. And then also from a revenue perspective, one of the unique aspects of Colgate is the professional recommendations, whether it\u2019d be dentists, veterinarians or dermatologists now. So, can you just help us understand how much of an impact the lack of office visits you think could have going forward on market share and ultimately, revenue? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Good morning, Dara. Let me start with taking a step back on, as you referenced, 2008, 2009 and reaffirm some of the strengths that allowed us to emerge through that crisis stronger. The portfolio of our business is very strong in recessions, as you well know. We have price points across the full continuum, particularly our core businesses. Playing on your comment around the professional endorsements that historically played very well for us and will continue to play very well for us during this crisis, particularly given the scientific nature of our products, and the efficacy of our products, and I wouldn't expect given that some people will not be visiting the profession, the strength of the brand will be altered in any way during that period. The brand continues to be very, very strong, and our endorsements from the professional all over the world continue to be strong. So I don't anticipate that we'll have any issues certainly some of our business moving through the profession will be impacted in the short-term, but long-term the brand strength will continue to prevail in this in this period of time. Moving on to the category, listen, we've seen a lot of volatility in the categories. Hence, one of the reasons that we pulled guidance. There's a lot of uncertainties as things jump up and down. But rest assured people are still brushing their teeth. And as you've seen, people are still taking a lot of showers and washing their hands. In some categories, we expect the behavior change to be quite consistent over the next couple months. Liquid hand soap bar soap, bar cleaners, we've seen a real acceleration in consumption in those categories. And our anticipation is those will continue. Oral Care has been negative as some of the pipeline comes out from February and March and April. But we expect that category will come back, particularly as economies start to loosen up and you get more and more traffic coming back in the stores. As you've seen, we've had tremendous growth in e-commerce. That was what we discussed at the CAGNY, a big, big focus area for us over the last nine months. We put a lot of resources into that space. We're really learning. Obviously, the Hill's business is best-in-class. We're transferring those learnings around the world. So we're getting consumption in the categories that you're seeing quite weak in brick-and-mortar coming through in e-commerce now. And certainly, that will play well for us longer term. So overall, categories will come back, a lot of volatility right now in emerging markets. I was on the phone this morning with our Asia team, and they're seeing things come back quite nicely. We're about 75% of where they were pre-crisis, but that has stepped up meaningfully over the last six weeks or so. And so overall, we'll see categories come back, but it's about getting store traffic back and getting some of the economy solution. But overall, looking okay. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning, and hope all is well. So you sounded very positive to Dara's question on consumption trend, especially soap. So Noel, I was hoping if you can comment a little bit of consumption and what's happening in April. Are you still working on replenishing the shelves? Or did you benefit from stockpiling, primarily, I would say, probably in North America and Western Europe? Or are you seeing trends reaccelerate as you go? And how much production capacity are you being able to keep up to your comments about Asia and other parts of the world? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Andrea. So let's take North America first. Obviously, significant spikes in March relative to consumption, a lot of the panic buying, but more importantly, some of the trends I articulated earlier around how we're seeing consumption increase in certain categories like bar soap, like liquid hand soap, like floor cleaners. And that has continued through April, as John said. We've seen strong category growth in those specific areas. Obviously, some of the momentum that we're seeing in April is replenishing inventories that were at very low levels coming out of March, particularly in those high-demand categories. Conversely, in categories where we saw pantry loading like Oral Care, we've seen the categories come down in consumption as you would expect, given the pantry load that was in March, and no specific reason why consumers would be brushing their teeth more. So it would be what you expect. Categories where consumers are using them more, good consumption and categories that were driven by some of the panic buying has slowed down, and in fact, are negative in April. And that would be consistent for both Europe and the U.S. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Wendy Nicholson of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. Just one housekeeping issue. On Hill's, can you remind us what percentage of that business is e-comm? And I know you said the whole business, the whole company on e-comm was up 50% for the quarter, but can you tell us a sense of how much Hills' e-comm business was up. But then my real question is more structurally, actually on China, where I know you've had some market share challenges over the last couple of years. I'm just curious, because I know that's a very fragmented market. There's so many local brands in the Oral Care category. Do you think you've done anything structural in that category, so that you're going to emerge from the COVID crisis with a stronger market share position? I'm just wondering if the crisis has sort of helped wash out maybe some of that local competition. Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Wendy. Let me take Hill's. Obviously, as John mentioned, the Hill's success, once again, in the quarter was extraordinary. And I think it really points to the underlying strength of that business : one, great core innovation; two, great efficacious scientific brands that play really well in the marketplace; and three, an incredibly adept organization around winning digitally and winning online. Specifically online, to your question, their business was up in excess of the company growth, which was around 54%, 55% for total Colgate. Hill's was up 57% in the quarter and saw good progress across particularly some of the key initiatives they implemented with some of the brick-and-mortar retailers, which was unusual, given some of the struggles that, that retail environment had. But overall, great growth on Hill's. It's a high -- it's in the teens in terms of percent of sales. It continues to grow, obviously, and the success we've had with some of the Science Diet relaunch, particularly in some of the pure-play retailers has been quite notable. Moving on to China, all the strategies, Wendy, that we put in place that we've talked about over the last 18 months or so, repositioning the portfolio, moving significant structural changes relative to moving from brick-and-mortar to online, both in resource and capabilities, all of that is playing out really well for us. We've stepped up our innovation, particularly in the online space. You heard John talk about Miracle Repair. I did get some good news this morning that the Darlie franchise has returned to the number one share of market brand in the country. We had lost share market to Yunnan Baiyao, the local player. We have returned to leadership in March, which is terrific. Shares are up for both Colgate and Darlie in March. We're seeing good progression there, particularly in the online space. More work to do on Colgate. However, the significant repositioning of the portfolio will happen in the back half of this year. But structurally, we've made all the changes that we think are necessary to win. And as I mentioned earlier, I think big brands are going to win in this environment, whether it's in Asia or anywhere around the world, the proven efficacy positioning the scientific knowledge that we have and how we communicate that in our brand purpose, particularly around our core businesses, will bode well moving forward. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Great. Thanks. Noel, maybe just to build on that. You've spoken about what you're seeing today on the ground generally in emerging markets. But can we get a little more insight into how you're thinking about the go forward? Just comparing what you just said there about China to what you expect over time in India versus Eastern Europe versus Brazil and Latin America. And I guess, whether in terms of the shape of consumer demand, the competition and market share outlook. And specific to Latin America, your confidence in your ability to realize pricing where those FX transaction cost pressures are probably going to be most acute over the next couple of quarters? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. Historically, we handle these crisis is quite well in emerging markets, given the pricing power that we have. So, let's talk a little bit about our strategy right now, which we think will modify slightly as we see some of the recessionary pressures come. Obviously, a lot of opportunity for us in the premium side of the business. We've been discussing that with you for the last 18 months or so, how much upside we have on premium innovation. That will continue to happen as I mentioned. But we will dial up more of our core innovation, particularly given the price points that we have and the size of those businesses in emerging markets. And those tend to be the opening price points in many big markets, whether it's Mexico, Brazil or India. So you'll see more innovation coming in that space, and we're doing a lot of things very, very quickly to adapt to some of the consumer behavior changes we've seen, particularly around the importance of health and hygiene and how that plays out with some of our products. Interesting, as we've gone through the last couple of months, our focus on the Total relaunch, particularly the antibacterial positioning and long-lasting antibacterial benefit that product provides has benefited us greatly in the last six weeks. We've seen some of our big markets, whether it be Brazil, Mexico, U.K., we've seen the premium innovation on Total working. So moving forward a little bit more on core, continue to focus on premium side, but we think we're positioned well for the emerging markets. Now obviously, we can't anticipate how much unemployment will be in some of these markets or potential lockdowns that we'll see coming from COVID, but the portfolio, at least how we're positioning it, we'll be well positioned for the emerging trends that we'll see there. Likewise, the same in India and Eastern Europe, there will be no change. The strategy will be consistently executed around the world, locally adapted as necessary. But we don't see that changing based on any of the markets. China would be perhaps the exception, given some of the portfolio strategies that we'll be adopting in the back half and the specific needs of that market. Your second question around LatAm pricing, again, it's -- obviously, the devaluation has been significant. So we've got a couple of things that we're looking at. Obviously, we've taken pricing. You saw that in the first quarter. We will continue to take pricing, but it will get a little bit more difficult, particularly in the current environment. We've had opportunities to dial back on promotions in some of those markets as we see, obviously, store traffic down. So we've been quite prudent. On how we're thinking about promotional spend, a lot of work on revenue growth management and price pack architecture, particularly now as we move into a recessionary environment. So, we'll see more of that happening. And a little bit more benign pricing environment -- excuse me, material pricing environment moving forward, we think the combination of all of that will allow us to continue to maintain the integrity of the LatAm P&L and maintain the investment, which is still important for us to emerge stronger coming out of this. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Olivia Tong of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Just want to talk about shifts in your view in terms of innovation rollout, given, obviously, there's a lot of stock up already, recession coming. And then just marketing around that. Marketing was particularly strong this quarter. So the support is still pretty high. But just wondering as you think about the rest of the year and where consumer pantries -- positions of consumer pantries, how you think about innovation and marketing? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Olivia. So as I just mentioned, we're -- we've been doubling down on innovation for the better part of 18 months now. And it's interesting as a management team, as we've gone into this, we've obviously been looking specifically at what innovation is right for the current environment. We will be moving some things around as necessary. We're dialing up some areas. We've orchestrated a series of teams internally to work specifically around some of the common truth that we're seeing, particularly in the health and hygiene spaces : one, how we adopt our portfolio; and two, how we accelerate innovation moving into this. What's interesting is we have just a long history of great clinical studies and claims and science behind our products that we think we can pull out of the jaws and use in this current environment, great formulations with great science and claims that will play into health and hygiene. So we think very appropriate for us to look at our innovation and modify it as necessary moving forward. And the key focus for us here is agility and doing this really, really quickly. So you'll start to see some of that innovation come to the market in the back half of this year already that wasn't necessarily there before. Some of the bigger premium innovations, as I mentioned, will stay. We will alter those based on some of the spacing, whether it's moving out later in the third quarter, so to speak, versus earlier to allow some normalization, particularly in some of our key markets where we see store traffic down quite considerably right now. So that will happen. Continuing to support the business, we've always done that during tough times, and we've come out of it stronger as a result. The brands have emerged stronger. We see competition spending quite a bit, at least on the media side, a lot more movement for us in the digital and e-commerce space, which we're putting a lot more money in. And I think you can see the results that we generated in the first quarter. Certainly, that shift of resources and spending in e-commerce is paid out for. So marketing spending will be prudent and thoughtful moving forward to be sure. But we'll continue to support our brands, which we believe is in the best interest of generating the long-term growth that we want to deliver. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And I hope you are doing well. Noel, question on consumption trends and specifically, those increases in consumption that are more transitory in the current environment versus those that you see as more lasting, given changes in consumer behavior. So we're already seeing a move towards greater working from home. I think there's every expectation that's going to persist, heightened emphasis on health and wellness, accelerated shift to e-commerce, just to name a few. But as you think about your portfolio across Oral Care, Home Care, Personal Care and Pet, can you discuss whether you see a change in consumption trends longer term that are more lasting? If so, do you see this as a net positive for your portfolio? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure, Kevin. And -- the obvious is we have a very large soap business globally, one of our bigger categories. We obviously have a large liquid hand soap business, particularly in Europe and the U.S. We don't talk a lot about our Home Care business, but we have a very strong Home Care business in Latin America as well as in Europe and growing really quickly in North America. All those businesses, we're seeing behavior changes that we think will stick moving forward. I mean, consumers will wash their hands more, people staying at home will be cleaning their floors more. Obviously, people are washing their clothing more. So our fabric softener business will benefit from that. So categories where we see behavior change, we compete in quite a few of them. Obviously, people aren't going to stop brushing their teeth. And that will continue to be obviously a growth opportunity moving forward for us, but we don't see any sizable changes there. We'll see more volatility in the Oral Care space, I think, because you probably see more pantry loading in terms of how people are buying products coming in and out of the category less frequently. So obviously, as we think about innovation, we'll have to time that innovation quite carefully and be quite prudent on that. So overall, our categories are positioned quite well. Obviously, skin health is an area where we've seen quite a bit of disruption in, whether it be travel retail or some of our pharmacy business in Europe as well as our derm business here in the U.S. And we're working very closely with those teams, particularly in the area of telehealth, working on opportunities to continue to engage those communities so they can serve their customers with product online. We talked about the Hill's to Home model that we've been driving over the last year, which has done very, very well for Hill's. We're expanding that into our skin health business in order to stimulate demand at both institutions and spas as well as derms. So, overall, we'll see that category go through a bumpy road, we think, over the next couple months, six months or so. But if you go back to 2008 and 2009, you know, it took more or less nine months to 12 months for that category to come back. The basic fundamentals for skin health long term are still really, really good. It's a highly profitable category. So long-term, we're very comfortable with where we are, but we'll make the necessary changes in the short-term in skin health. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Bill Chappell : Thanks. Good morning. And again, hope you and your family are well. Noel Wallace : Thanks Bill. Bill Chappell : Just a kind of question on the supply chain. I mean, certainly remarkable, as I'm sure you're aware, that you and your peers can kind of have manufacturing plants running at 80%, 90% capacity on a regular basis, all of a sudden, takes the surge of the business and really have pretty limited out of stocks. And so I'm just trying to understand what near term, is that margin-accretive business as you're going even faster? Or do you have to have incremental costs that will ease as you go forward? And then longer term, what does that tell you about your supply chain that you can handle that much more capacity when you thought they were already at 80% to 90% utilization? Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Bill. So again, as I mentioned in my prepared commentary, it's been inspiring to watch our supply chain around the world deal with this. And we have discussions internally how important some of the crisis management meetings that we have throughout the year to deal with contingency planning and risk mitigation. And all of that really prevailed during these difficult times. It's the global supply chain and the standardization that we have and how we operate it, while globally is still very local, we're able to shift resources very, very quickly. So as I mentioned, right out of the gate, when China started to struggle, we shifted resources into Europe immediately. And we're able to supply everywhere that China was supplying out of Europe. Likewise, as Europe started to be challenged or Latin America or US started to be challenged, we were able to shift back to Asia. So there's a lot of flexibility in our supply chain and the credit to the team. A lot of work goes into that, to be sure. Some of the incremental volumes that we've seen, obviously, we pushed to contractors, that comes out of the lower margin. But moving forward, as we work on some of these standardization opportunities that I mentioned, for instance, working with some of our key trade partners to simplify our portfolios, that will allow us to reduce the SKUs that we're producing and bring some of that production back in-house, where we can elevate capacity based on the simplification efforts that come through that. Obviously, strategically, we're also looking at investing in some of these categories to expand capacity as required moving forward to ensure that we can meet the demand that we see ongoing. So, short-term, we anticipate that there's some margin implications with the costs associated with COVID, whether it's logistics or some of the contract that we have longer term or we'll bring that back in-house and find ways to continue to deliver the margin that's accretive to the business. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Steve Strycula of UBS. Please go ahead. Steve Strycula : Hi, good morning, Noel and John. Noel Wallace : Hey, Steve. Steve Strycula : Question on the incentive structure back to 2019 when, Noel, when you took over as CEO, it seems like there's a greater index waiting to organic sales emphasis and market share performance. So within that, how do we think about there is visible pockets of opportunity over the next two, three years? And specifically, how can Colgate use the volatility in the current marketplace and kind of lean in with investments to emerge stronger during this period of time. And John, quick clarification for the FX implication to sales, how should we think about the multiplier factors, what that could be to EBIT dollars or EPS? Thank you. Noel Wallace : So, Steve, as I mentioned, these -- we've been around for a long, long time. Colgate, we've dealt with a lot of crisis and depressions and even pandemics at one point in time. So, this is obviously very unusual, and there's a lot of unpredictability, which is, obviously, you've heard in the print throughout the last two weeks, but we continue to focus on the fundamentals, which we've been building for the last two years to strengthen our business. So, it's building `brands with purpose, and that's the reason why we will continue to invest behind our brands. We've always found that our ability to innovate and invest in difficult times allows us to emerge with strong brands and strong income statements as we come out of this. And we'll continue to do that. We've stepped up our productivity measures as you've heard me talk about quite often. We're using digital very differently across the company, the collaboration tools that we put in place going into this based on the Google suite of tools has been, just quite frankly, extraordinary to get 10,000 people working day one virtually was, I think, a testament to our IT organization and what we've been able to do there, likewise, using technology to drive more productivity in our closings, so all of that will continue to dial up as we go through this. Relative to the incentive structure, we'll continue to be focused on organic sales and obviously, bottom line profitability. That continues to be the focus for the company. You've seen the reacceleration of our business over the last six quarters. Even with some of the pantry, we accelerated our organic sales in the quarter, both from a Hill's standpoint and from a Colgate standpoint. So, the underlying fundamentals for the business, we believe, are quite strong. And continuing to invest in them, continuing to build capabilities, as I mentioned earlier, in spaces like digital, e-commerce and analytics, we believe will position us extremely well coming out of this. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Noel Wallace : Hey Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : I wanted to talk a little bit more -- we've talked about Latin America quite a bit. But what we have been thinking about is the degree to which some of the strategies that you'd outlined as part of your longer-term plan around premium innovation and pursuing new channels. But part of this is about kind of accelerated category growth in the region as maybe some of the household penetration or daily usage trends have kind of plateaued at some level if there is an opportunity, but the pace of development on those factors has been a little bit less. So, if we go into a severe recession in those regions, does sort of the growth of the market flow or go -- the efforts you were trying to leverage to accelerate the growth, is that just a bit less effective in the near term or intermediate term? Or am I missing something in terms of there's more opportunity on household penetration or usage that can keep market growth rates healthier. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Lauren. It really depends on the category. I mean, obviously, some of the ones I mentioned earlier like liquid hand soap and bar soap, we will expect in emerging markets, for instance, liquid hand soap penetration to grow. Those are fundamentally bar soap markets. But the efficiency and hygiene nature of liquid hand soap may lend itself to increase band penetration. Products like spray cleaners and wipes, we'll see more penetration grow, and we're expanding those as well. So there are certain categories where we see certainly the opportunity to grow penetration, particularly ones that are -- provide an efficiency or an added value, and that will be our focus. Consumption in those categories, likewise, will probably offset some of the pricing pressures that you'll see in some of those markets. We typically found not significant trade down in recessions, but you do get some for sure. And we've been able to deal with that with revenue growth management, obviously, a focus on innovating behind the core, which is, as I mentioned earlier, usually at opening price points. And that allows us to take pricing in those categories. Price pack architecture and recessions has always worked quite effectively for us. So it really depends on the category and the market. Overall, we'll probably see a little slowness or a reduction in terms of value growth. Volumes, as I mentioned, people don't stop brushing their teeth. And in categories, which we mentioned, we in fact, think we'll see an increase in consumption moving through this. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yes, thanks, and good morning everybody. Noel Wallace : Hi, Mark. Mark Astrachan : A quick follow-up. So one, just on Latin America in terms of how are you thinking about pricing in a market, especially some of the bigger countries where inflation is actually below recent historical levels. I mean, I recall more pricing to inflation as opposed to FX, so maybe just some thoughts there. And then secondly, just a reminder on input costs and the ties to oil kind of directionally, and how we should think about that potentially being offset by some of the higher costs that you mentioned before on manufacturing, other things you're doing around COVID? Noel Wallace : Sure. Nothing -- on the pricing front, obviously, in some of the emerging markets, we're going to be quite prudent and cautious on how we're looking at pricing. Although historically, we have been quite aggressive in taking -- we took pricing in the first quarter. That will obviously translate through the balance of the year. We have plans to continue to look at pricing, and we'll do that quite creatively, either through managing our gross to net much more efficiently, particularly given store traffic being down. We'll do that through some of our channel focus as well. We'll do that through some of our innovation in terms of price points, innovation at different price points. So, we have different mechanisms that we'll be using. We obviously will gauge what competitors are doing. But given some of our leadership positions in most of the emerging markets, our intent will be to lead pricing. And we've always done that, but we'll be mindful of how we do that, particularly given the sensitivity in the current environment. On the cost side, we see, obviously, costs being a little less of a headwind than they were in the year-ago period. We've seen resins obviously come down. But on the flip side, prices have gone up, ag prices have gone up. But net-net, we'll see less headwinds than we saw in the back half of last year. And we'll watch it all very carefully. As you've heard most others talk about, there's typically a six to nine month lag between the drop of oil prices and where we see the benefit moving through, through the P&L. But by and large, we'll see a better environment in the back half of the year. And as I mentioned earlier, we'll start to see some of those costs from COVID subside, particularly as we bring some of that production in-house and some of the panic buying becomes a little bit more predictable. Difficult at this stage to say that, but we expect it to become a little bit more predictable, which allow us to get a better line of sight on how we want to handle capacity planning for our facilities and our contractors. And bear in mind, Mark, one other point is, obviously, some of the logistics costs associated with this, we're doing everything we can to deliver the customer service that our partners or customers are looking for and there will be some added logistics costs that will come in the year-ago period as well associated with this. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Rob Ottenstein of Evercore Investment Bank. Please go ahead. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much, guys. Noel, John, I want to call you guys out a little bit. The press release is very conservative. You're withdrawing guidance, but kind of everything I hear on this call is very positive. April is strong. You're raising advertising 13%. You're going to dial up marketing. You're crushing it in e-commerce. China's getting better. You're getting significant -- what you see as ongoing increases in your cleaning and sanitary products. You're getting pretty good volume in pricing in Mexico, Brazil. And your cost outlook in the second half of the year, you say, is very encouraging. So I'm a little confused in terms of the caution in the press release and taking away guidance, all things considered. And obviously, very, very tough environment out there, but the commentary so far has been so positive. I'm confused. Noel Wallace : So listen, it's straight to what we said in the commentary. The unpredictability of what we're seeing across the world is at a level that we've never seen before. Obviously, India, we didn't anticipate would shut down like it shut down. We had plants and distribution channels shut down for almost two weeks. They're obviously coming back online as we speak, but that had a significant impact at the back end of the quarter and has had a significant impact in April. And we can't predict exactly where it's going to happen. Obviously, we've seen things creep up in terms of the number of incidences in Brazil. So, what happens there going forward. So again, it's the unpredictability of what we're seeing all around the world. And you combine that with the continued strengthening of the dollar around the world and the foreign exchange headwinds that -- gives us pause. And we've seen, obviously, a lot of volatility, likewise, in some of the consumption numbers that we've been talking about throughout the call. They're jumping all over the place right now. And so it's very difficult to get a line of sight on how things are going to ultimately unfold. Yes, the fundamentals of our categories are good long-term, but the uncertainty with government regulations and disruptions moving forward, we think it's the prudent thing to hold our guidance at this stage. And we'll come back to you as soon as we can when we have a little bit more confidence on where things are headed. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English : Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for signing me in. Hope everyone is well and congrats to you and your firm for navigating the situation as well as you have so far. I want to come back to the last question because I thought it was a great question. I mean you responded to the part about why pull the guidance, I get it. But I think Rob and I had the same reaction to the press release and the same conflicting interpretation of this call so far. I want to zoom in on one line in the press release that maybe I read too much into. But in there, you say you expect government actions, consumer behavior related to COVID-19 and economic uncertainty to reduce category growth in many markets. I read that, and I interpret that as unequivocal deceleration on the forward. Maybe you were just simply referring to the exceptional growth in the first quarter. But when I listened to you walk through your expectations of each category and market, I hear lots of puts and takes. Skin care, a little softer, maybe a little bit of trade down in Oral Care, but all this is going to be offset by personal and home sanitization and cleaning. Is that the right interpretation? It's going to be choppy and slower in the first quarter, but as you think about underlying growth rates, while there's a lot of uncertainty, you don't really have a reason to think that your category is going to be materially slower going forward. Noel Wallace : Yes, Jason, listen, if you look at the weeklies, the monthlies on the categories all around the world, and I've got them here in front of me, they're all over the place on categories like Oral Care. Obviously, you've seen more consistency in categories like liquid hand soap and bar soap and cleaners. The biggest unknown force, in our view, is the degree of the recession that we're going to see all around the world. And you combine that with the foreign exchange headwinds that we're faced with right now and ability to take pricing, which has always been a challenge in an environment like this, although we've had great success there, this is unique and a bit different. So it's really the uncertainty that we're seeing and the disruptions that we're seeing. So again, if big markets start to get -- have more lockdowns, that creates a significant headwind for us. It creates a significant headwind for the category. If we see unemployment jump 10%, 15% in certain markets, we've not dealt with that in the past. That will have some impact on the value orientation of our categories as well. So all in all, there's uncertainty moving forward. We're trying to position ourselves as well as we can. We've got good experience on this, but there is significant unpredictability based on what I've outlined earlier. Operator : And we have no further questions over the phone at this time. I would like to conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll now hand it back to your speakers for any closing or additional remarks. Noel Wallace : Well, thanks, everyone. Obviously, unusual and unprecedented times, I want to once again thank all the Colgate people. It's inspiring to work with such an incredibly talented organization. We're greatly benefited by having a management team that has dealt with this level of uncertainty, but obviously, working hard to continue to deliver the results. And we look forward to having more discussions with everyone moving forward. Thanks, everyone. Be safe. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded and is being broadcasted live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now, for opening remarks, I would like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, John Faucher. Please go ahead. John Faucher : Thanks, Amanda. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables eight and nine of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are; Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Henning Jakobsen, Chief Financial Officer. I will discuss our Q2 performance and provide some context around 2020 before turning it over to Noel for his thoughts on our results and the current operating environment. We will then open it up for Q&A. As usual, we request that you limit yourselves to one question, so that as many people as possible get to ask the question. If you have further questions, you are welcome to re-enter the queue. We are pleased with our second quarter performance as we delivered gross and net sales, organic sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow in Q2 2020 despite headwinds from foreign exchange, the worsening global economy and impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  We delivered growth in five of our six divisions with Europe down slightly where consumers worked down some of the extra pantry inventory they purchased in the first quarter. Our gross profit margin was 60.8% on both a GAAP and a base business basis. On a GAAP basis, this was up 110 basis points year-over-year, on a base business basis our gross profit margin for the quarter was up 120 basis points, our best year-over-year performance in several years.  For the second quarter, pricing was 130 basis points favorable to gross margin, while raw materials were a 320 basis points headwinds, primarily driven by the transactional impact in foreign exchange. Productivity added 220 basis points. On a GAAP basis, our SG&A was up 40 basis points as a percent of sales.  On a base business basis, our SG&A was up 60 basis points in the quarter on a percent of sales basis, driven by a 50 basis point increase in advertising to sales, as our advertising spending was up 6% year-over-year on an absolute basis, and by an increase in logistics cost as we work to meet heightened demand due to COVID-19. Excluding logistics, our overheads were down slightly as a percent of sales, despite the FX headwinds in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 7% year-over-year, while it was up 2% on a base business basis. Our ATS was up 9% on a GAAP basis and up 3% on a base business basis.  We delivered strong free cash flow growth in the quarter, up 67% year-over-year, due primarily to favorable working capital performance, particularly in accounts receivable, net income growth and the timing of income tax payments. Year-to-date, our free cash flow was up almost 50%. A few comments on our divisional performance now. North America delivered strong growth in the quarter, bated by increased demand across toothpaste, personal care and home care. As with Q1, growth was led by those categories, where we believe we have seen sustained changes in consumer behavior. Liquid hand soaps, hand dish soap and household cleaners.  The performance of Optic White Renewal helped drive strong growth in tootpaste in the quarter with share improvement for the Optic White franchise. Latin America net sales were down 13.5% in the quarter, as strong pricing growth was offset by significant foreign exchange headwinds and a mid-single-digit volume decline. Our team in Latin America has responded well to the crisis, working to keep our teams safe, despite rising cases of COVID-19 in many markets, implementing pricing to offset foreign exchange movements and adapting promotional programs.  While we were pleased with our pricing performance, and the gross profit margin expansion has helped deliver, our volumes were down. We expect the balance will improve in the second half of the year driven by innovation, increased marketing spending, and a return to a more normalized promotional cadence.  Organic sales growth was strong in Brazil, despite a very difficult operating environment. Europe delivered mid-single-digit net sales growth in the quarter, as the inclusion of Filorga, more than offset the impact of foreign exchange and a modest organic volume decline. Consumers in Europe began their pantry destocking during the quarter and this led to category softness across many of our categories although liquid hand soap, dish soap and bleach remained buoyant.  We planned for this weakness in Q2 and have shifted our marketing plan to take advantage of what we expect to be improved category growth in the second half of the year as we believe consumers are well along in this destocking process.  Net sales were down 3% in Asia Pacific with volume declines in negative foreign exchange, partially offset by higher pricing as the division returned to modest organic sales growth in the quarter. China returned to growth in the second quarter and continues to improve as e-commerce drives significant growth. While our net sales and organic sales in India were down in the quarter, trends have improved since the nationwide shutdown that negatively impacted March and April. There is still some disruption to the retail networks consistent with what you have heard from other companies.  In Africa and Eurasia, net sales were down in the quarter, as foreign exchange more than offset low-single-digit organic sales growth with strong performance in South Africa which was driven by volume growth. We took pricing in many markets including Russia to offset the foreign exchange headwind.  Growth at Hill\u2019s remain strong, driven by a combination of underlying category growth, market share gains due to the Hill Science Diet relaunch, ecommerce strength and a rebuild of retail inventories following a very strong first quarter. Once again, Hill\u2019s ecommerce business grew more than 50% in the quarter.  As we said in the press release, due to the continued uncertainties surrounding the potential business impacts from COVID-19, and the related macroeconomic volatility, we are not providing guidance. However, as we did on the first quarter call, we want to provide some context around certain factors that you should consider as you work on your models for 2020.  We believe the consumption for certain of our categories, like liquid hand soap, dish soap, bar soap and household cleaners remains elevated and that this should continue going forward. In other categories like toothpaste and pet nutrition, we believe that consumption rates are stable and that some of the first half growth that resulted in increased pantry inventory, mainly to reverse in certain geographies in the back half of the year. As we mentioned in the press release, we still expect foreign exchange to have a negative mid-single-digit impact on net sales for the full year. Based on current spot rates, we would expect the impact to be at the low-end of that range.  We continue to expect our tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22% on a GAAP basis. On a base business basis, we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. We continue to plan for less benefit from share repurchase in the year as we focus more of our cash flow on reducing the debt on the Filorga and Hello transactions. While we pause share repurchases under our repurchase program in the second quarter, our full year share repurchase plans have not changed.  And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Noel. Noel Wallace : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy despite the challenging circumstances. I thought I\u2019d start off by giving a couple of thoughts on the quarter and then I\u2019ll provide you a quick update on where we stand relative to the focus areas that we laid out on the Q1 call. So, good quarter. We continue to deliver and what I would say a very difficult operating environment in the second quarter, despite the uncertainty around COVID which is quite substantial, particularly including the accelerated case rates that we are seeing in many of our largest markets and the impact as John mentioned, the economic activity that we are seeing around the world, we delivered very strong organic sales growth above our long-term target of 3% to 5%.  Importantly, strong gross margin expansion and you saw that obviously delivered through strong funding in the growth and productivity measures and really good pricing that we are broad based across our categories and geographies. That allowed us to increase advertising which has been a consistent theme for us over the last couple quarters and importantly expand our operating margins in the end.  And again, and that\u2019s despite dealing with significant headwinds on foreign exchange particularly in Latin America, you saw the foreign exchange hit, that was around 6%. Unfortunately the headwinds from the crisis, we see them continuing and the rising number of COVID cases, particularly in some of our key markets means that the possibility of a larger disruption will continue to exist where there would be why the virus is felt or what we\u2019ve seen in some markets, government actions to defend the virus and those continue to be quite elevated and that remains our number one concern as we look at the back half of the year.  That said, underlying demand for our products remains solid, particularly in certain categories like liquid hand soap and dish, bar and cleaners, those with the health and hygiene orientation film where we compete quite successfully across the world.  We are delivering premium innovation in the quarter as well. You will hear me talk a little bit about the success of Optic White Renewal which is our highest price point toothpaste here in the U.S. have been a great success. We continue to focus on high growth channels. We\u2019ve had substantive growth in our ecommerce business and some of our discounted and club business as well.  And we are obviously dealing with a digital environment where consumers aren\u2019t leaving homes and quite successful in how we are delivering content in our advertising. That\u2019s consistent with the strategy that we\u2019ve been discussing for the last 18 months. That strategy was focusing on our core business, that\u2019s strategy is focused on adjacencies, particularly in the premium side of the business and the strategy that\u2019s focused on truly elevating our participation in fast-growing growth channels like ecommerce. And that was enabling us as you\u2019ve seen to deliver consistent top-line growth which the necessary \u2013 absolutely necessary for the long-term health of our business and we are delivering net growth which is broad based across our categories and broad based across geographies and we need to do that with volume and pricing consistently throughout the year.  If that broad based organic sales growth will balance us to expand the gross margin, we\u2019ve been particularly focused on that this quarter. Doing that despite the significant headwinds that we\u2019ve seen from foreign exchange and the headwinds we\u2019ve seen from mix, particularly the mix of some of the categories that are elevated in the quarter.  That\u2019s allowed us to expand our gross profit pool and has allowed us to both fund the increases in marketing spending and capabilities and deliver the marketing \u2013 excuse me - the operating margin expansion to drive the EPS growth. So that\u2019s the quarter. So I thought I\u2019d now spend the rest of my opening comments around the balance of 2020 and looking a bit more into 2021.  So let me come back to the three focus areas we discussed in the first quarter call. And they were, staying true to our values and purpose which is going to help us navigate through this environment. How we as a company are adapting a strategy that we have been consistently deploying for the better part of 18 months and how we are executing that strategy with more agility and that\u2019s been a capability that we have integrated across the company and how we are managing through the crisis with an eye, importantly towards the future and I am mostly, quite frankly with how the company is dealing with the short-term issues that come weekly around the crisis, but more importantly, very focused on ensuring that the long-term health of the business and how we deploy our strategy over the next year to two is being executed.  So let me start with how we are staying true to our values and how that\u2019s helping us navigate through the challenges of this environment. Our number one priority, as you\u2019ve heard continues to be the health and safety of Colgate people and their families all around the world. We continue to enforce home policies across the board where possible, although some of our offices have began to open up.  Our global supply chain team has delivered remarkably well given the volatility they\u2019ve seen and spikes of demand for our products and the challenges with the suppliers all over the world. We are sustaining our manufacturing capacity in many cases elevating that and we are dealing with increased demand of products that have been excessive in certain categories and doing that exceedingly well.  And importantly, coming back to values and purposes is making sure that we are giving back to the communities that we serve through our #SafeHands program that we talked about in the first quarter, our partnership with the World Health Organization. We\u2019ve distributed three bars of hand soap to over 28 different countries now to promote hand washing techniques which is obviously the first line in defense in fighting COVID-19 and our teams are extraordinarily proud of the efforts that we put in place in that regard.  The second focus area is how we are adapting our strategy and executing with agility. The current strategy I\u2019ve outlined is working core adjacencies, faster growth channels. We\u2019ve been seeing consistent performance across our categories and geographies against that strategy, but we realize in the current environment that we need to continue to be agile and we need to adapt our marketing strategies where necessary.  For example, you\u2019ve seen the continued success we\u2019ve had on our Hill\u2019s business. We\u2019ve been partnering with some of our lead pet specialty retailers were moving money from in-store promotions to digital content to help elevate not only the brand itself across all ecommerce platforms, but to drive foot traffic back into their stores. That\u2019s helped us obviously drive shares during the quarter and continue to have very successful growth on the ecommerce business for the Hill\u2019s category.  As we look at the back half, we are obviously getting much more data as we build our digital capabilities. We are using that to supplement our RGM efforts. You saw significant pricing in the quarter and I am very pleased with how the team has really brought on RGM tactics using data analytics to drive pricing. We\u2019ll use that as we think about redeploying more money in the back half into a promotion environment that will likely be more competitive. So, all consistent with the strategy that we talked about and enabling us to obviously deliver the balanced growth that you see.  So, let me move on to the third area of focus, managing through the crisis with an eye towards the future. Obviously, we want to emerge from this stronger than we went in. So we will continue to invest quite aggressively in the back half of this year. We\u2019ve got strong plans both on above the line advertising, as well as in-store promotions in the back half that will complement a good innovation grid that we\u2019ve adjusted to deal with the current behaviors that we are seeing in the market. in that RE but driving : And as I mentioned on the last quarter, productivity will continue to be key for us. Our funding the growth overdelivered in the quarter for us. We continue to offset some of the incremental cost we\u2019ve seen from COVID. So, so far, so good. But productivity is a never ending journey for us and will continue to be a key focus as we move forward.  So, those are our priorities and although there is tremendous amount of uncertainty right now, I am confident that we have the right priorities and the right strategies and most importantly, an incredibly engaged organization deploying and executing the strategy to navigate through this crisis and ultimately emerge stronger on the other side.  So, with that, I\u2019ll open up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hi guys. Hope all is well. Pricing number really accelerated in the quarter to 3.5% level which the best we\u2019ve seen in recent history. Was that more related to sustainable price increases or the RGM efforts that you guys mentioned that have been put in place, particularly in emerging markets which look like it drove the corporate pricing, but was there more variances specific to the quarter such as promotional spending except for that you guys mentioned.  And how sustainable are the drivers behind this pricing shrink in the quarter as you look going forward? Then perhaps you can just talk about demand elasticity in emerging markets from that pricing? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Darren. So, obviously, as we were coming out of the first quarter, we talked about the significant headwinds we were facing around foreign exchange particularly in some of the emerging markets and as you\u2019ve seen consistently over the years, our teams on the ground look to recover the transactional impact of those foreign exchange very, very quickly and get that pricing into the P&L.  You saw it obviously manifest itself through the pricing across the company largely driven by emerging markets, where we saw most of the foreign exchange headwinds. So, really pleased with the fact that teams got ahead of this in the quarter and the strength. So that we now have the ability to use that pricing that we have in the P&L to obviously continue to drive gross margins moving forward, but it\u2019s necessary to invest in the business in the back half and that gives us maximum flexibility which is what we were looking for going into the third quarter.  There was some pullback in promotions in the quarter. Obviously, we were very disciplined whereas foot traffic was down in certain REs around the world [Technical Difficulty] lockdowns in some markets. We naturally pulled back with a discipline to ensure that we can move that money into the back half of the year of those promotional slots to elevate the volume that we are looking for in the back half.  So, we believe it\u2019s sustainable. We obviously took the pricing early. That gives us the most \u2013 the best ability to control that moving forward and we intend to obviously, as I said, spend in the back half. But we are comfortable with where we are in terms of our ability to manage some of the foreign exchange positivity that we have seen. Operator : And our next question will come from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Please go ahead. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about gross margin? But I don\u2019t know you called that out as a specific area of focus in the second quarter. But I am trying to get a sense of how much of the improvement \u2013 you just mentioned the reduction in promotional spending, how much of that was sort of structural funding to growth cost savings that we should think are here to say versus on a short-term crisis management type benefits? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. Well, we obviously saw significant transaction moving through and despite that, we were able to recover that with strong pricing in the quarter. And again, we saw elevated foreign exchange headwinds coming out of the first quarter and very much elevated as we went into April and that allowed us to take the pricing early in the quarter and get the full benefit of the pricing as we went through the quarter.  Likewise, our funding to growth and productivity efforts have been very, very strong. I think certainly as we step back and manage the complexities associated with the disruptions we\u2019ve seen on the supply chain, some of the portfolio changes we\u2019ve made, obviously the leverage that we are seeing coming through the P&L, all of that has assisted us to drive more efficiency through our plans and get that delivered on the gross margin line.  So, overall, we felt very good about where the gross profit was. Obviously the pricing early in the quarter helped and the funding to growth that came through the balance of the quarter likewise helped. But again, as I mentioned, there are, Wendy, we obviously we are very selective in where we were spending money at the promotional line in the quarter.  We did pull back in some areas as we didn\u2019t see the ROI there that would have expected given the foot traffic down \u2013 it was down. As we see foot traffic come back in the back half of the year, we have full intentions to ensure that we are competitive and we continue to drive volume in the year to go. Operator : And next we will hear from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Yes. I think you and hope all is well. Noel, if you can comment a bit on the supply chain in terms of like of your capacity could increase over the quarter? And then the stock out on shelves that you are now being able to \u2013 sit to consumption, can you take us around the world? That would be great. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. In general, obviously, as I had in my upfront comment, the supply chain has performed extremely well. The demand in some of our categories has been significant at levels that we\u2019ve never seen before. That forced our teams very early on to look at how we simplify and optimize our portfolios in order to drive throughput in our factories.  I think that\u2019s been well received by our trade partners in order to ensure that we improve \u2013 we improve our case bill numbers with them. That being said, we still have some categories where we are not meeting demand. Liquid hand soap would be one of those. The demand is in excess of our capacity. We brought on capacity through contractors.  Obviously, we saw some of the impact of that in the U.S. at the margin line, but that\u2019s allowed us to deliver against the service levels that our retail partners are expecting. We are in the midst of obviously looking at how we put more capital into certain of our facilities, because we see some of these categories will have elevated demand.  We\u2019ve done some very innovative things relative to our packaging that has allowed us to use other lines for specific categories that were not used before that will allow different types of packaging to move through the category that also elevated our demand right now.  So, on a top-line basis we are meeting pretty much all of our demand except couple categories, liquid hand soap would be one, dish soap will be another where we are still trying to catch up and we anticipate that we will see that come to fruition in the back half of this year as we bring on more capacity and deal more efficiently with some of our contractors. Andrea Teixeira : All right. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Thanks. Good morning. Thank you. Good morning. Hope everyone is well. Two questions, first, if you could just talk through growth across the categories rather than divisions if you would put a little bit of numbers behind that.  And then, one topic more specific to emerging market trend, particularly Latin America\u2019s recession, because obviously the volume numbers have come in, but pricing has gone up pretty dramatically. So if you could just talk about what you think your categories are growing at underlying and your ability to manage to any potential downshift in the macros. Thanks so much. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Olivia. So, broad based categories are in aggregate are up versus the year ago. Obviously, to provide a significant demand of some of the health and hygiene products in the categories in which we compete. We\u2019ve seen real gyrations in the categories, so to speak, as we\u2019ve gone through the years. Some categories we saw the pantry loading in the first quarter.  Things like oral care where we saw significant spikes that have come out in the second quarter and we anticipate will continue to come out in the back half of the year. But overall, if we take it on a year-to-date basis, most of the categories continued to be obviously up. We\u2019ve seen elevated demand in the categories that we highlight, the liquid hand soap, bar soap, cleaners and dish. And we anticipate that most of that demand will continue quite frankly as behaviors change and people work from home which obviously aids in the consumption of our products, we\u2019ll continue to see that through the back half of the year. Relative to specifically oral care across the board, we\u2019ve seen good numbers on oral care in an aggregate basis, again, largely driven by the first quarter, slowed in the second quarter, particularly driven by LATAM.  And some of the pricing that we took, but we see that starting to improve as we went through the quarter and anticipate with the activity that we are bringing to the market particularly in tooth paste in the back half that we will continue to see good demand.  Relative to LATAM specifically, we\u2019ve gone through many, many recessions in LATAM. Our teams are very well prepared for this. Some of the models we viewed that get upfront with pricing which we\u2019ve done in the quarter. That gives us the maximum flexibility as we move in through a tougher environment. We have, as you know, a very competitive portfolio of products where we innovate across price points.  Particularly, in LATAM if you take \u2013 if you break our toothpaste business down between premium, mid-price and value, we do 50% of our business in mid-price and 25% in value and as we talk, we have real opportunities in the premium and particularly the super premium side, but as consumers move into a recession, we are very well positioned for that environment given the view of our portfolio.  So, and as we mentioned, inherent to our strategy is continuing to innovate behind our big core businesses. And we have some big core innovations coming in the next 12 months. So we think we are well prepared to handle the recession and we\u2019ll see how deep it is.  Obviously, the circumstances that we are dealing with around the spread of the virus, particularly in LATAM is concerning and gives us pause, relative to being cautious as we see the categories evolve over the next six to twelve months. So we will watch that very carefully. But we are prepared to deal with it as it comes. Operator : And next we will hear from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Congratulations on strong results. Noel Wallace : Thanks. Jason English : Noel, I think your response to last question, I heard you mentioned that throughout the quarter\u2019s trend that we saw in toothpaste or oral care in Latin America were improving. But I was hoping you could put a little more cheese on that comment. Where we should go with some quantification or specificity on how your overall business was performing in Latin America, month-on-month and maybe how it\u2019s tracking? And as you exit the quarter or so far in July? And if possible, love to hear the same type of figures for your developing markets overall? Noel Wallace : Right. I am not sure I understood the first, Jason. I think it was around the volume comment, pricing comment for LATAM. Let me just talk in broad strokes, LATAM for the quarter and hopefully I\u2019ll address most of your questions. By and large, a really good quarter for LATAM despite the fact that they faced significant issues and disruptions and when I say disruptions, you had a large part of the mom and pop trade in certain countries to completely shutdown big department stores, traffic was shutdown.  And so, as a result of that, you saw the shopping occasions decline in the quarter and despite that the team delivered across the board, shares were good across our categories in which we compete. As I mentioned earlier, they got the pricing. The pricing was significant in the quarter and there is no question when you take that level of the pricing and you couple that with the disruptions you are seeing in the marketplace relative to retail environment being closed. You are going to see some volume falloff and that\u2019s exactly what happened. And as we moved through the quarter, we started to see a bit more traffic coming back into the stores and we anticipate that we\u2019ll start to continue to see that in the back half of the year. That being said, you read the same press that we read that obviously the virus \u2013 the rates of infection continue to accelerate, particularly in big markets like Brazil.  So we need to be very mindful on the implications and the decisions governments may take to continue to contain that moving forward and that usually involves mobility and availability of people to get back into stores. So, overall, LATAM shares good. Volume little soft, but understandably given the issues that we saw around mobility and stores and likewise strong pricing that we took, but we will see strong investment in LATAM in the back half of the year, both on the advertising line to support a good innovation grid. And likewise, discipline on the promotion line to ensure that we are getting the right return on investment there. Operator : And our next question will come from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe going back to some of the topics you are discussing with there, may be at the start, but coming out with a slightly different perspective. If I step back and just look at the composition of your P&L for the first half, it\u2019s very healthy despite all the volatility, gross margins solidly above 60% with A&P is running at about 11.5% of sales.  Can you talk about some of the key enablers there? And is there any notable reason to think that that general composition changes meaningfully in the back half, because let\u2019s say, so far I am not sure I see one, but I just want to test my thinking on it. Noel Wallace : Sure. Again, let\u2019s come back to the strategy that we\u2019ve been deploying focusing on core innovation, that\u2019s big part of our portfolio and as we focus on core innovation, we take pricing. That\u2019s obviously you see that translating through the P&L. We have been quite disciplined in getting out ahead of foreign exchange particularly in some big markets that obviously delivered in the quarter through the gross margin expansion that we\u2019ve seen.  The channel expansion that we\u2019ve seen has been significant. I mean, we\u2019ve had significant growth both on ecommerce and some of the untracked channels that we don\u2019t talk a lot about, clubs and discounters.  And that again is consistent with the strategy that we\u2019ve been deploying for the last 18 months. And quite frankly, the whole challenge behind COVID-19 has been a catalyst for executing our strategy and we talk about adjacencies being the third vertical for us and we\u2019ve been aggressive in getting adjacencies into the market very quickly throughout the crisis and it\u2019s all behavior change.  We put more antibacterial products in the market. We put more health-oriented and hygiene-oriented products into the market. And again, I think that level of agility that we\u2019ve demonstrated all of that is between core adjacencies and channels helped obviously prop up the organic growth and get more consistent balanced growth, volume and pricing, as well as delivering the gross margin which allows to invest in the categories.  That being said, we do anticipate the back half to be competitive, I think as more and more markets slowly open up and again, I say that with the caveat that things can change very quickly there, but as they open up, I anticipate that we\u2019ll see more investments going back in stores and hence the reason why we wanted to get out in front of that with pricing in the quarter.  And as John mentioned in his upfront comments, we have increased advertising in the back half to deal with that and to continue to build momentum. So that\u2019s how we are looking at things. But it\u2019s challenging to be sure. The uncertainty that we see coming out of some of the large markets, the volatility that we see in categories, and the immediacy that governments are taking sometimes to contain the virus has implications and we have to deal with those. So we remain cautious, as well relative to how we see things unfolding. Operator : And our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. So, I wanted to talk a little bit about cost beyond you talked a bit about the productivity. In general, last year talking more about executing with agility and so on and we talked about quite a bit on the revenue side.  But I was wondering, as you\u2019ve navigated the first few months of this crisis, and things that maybe you have uncovered in the way that you operate, the way you are structured where cost resides in the P&L and the new organization, outside of T&E, but are there areas that you are finding that maybe are right for \u2013 to further efficiency and so that the kind of stronger applies to cost structure not just top-line. Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Lauren. Couple areas. Obviously, we\u2019ve been talking productivity beyond just the success we\u2019ve had with funding to growth over the years and as an organization, quarterly we\u2019ve really opened all line items now to think about productivity very differently. And so, beyond just the typical cost structure of our products which we do extremely well, we are now interrogating all areas of the business.  And quite frankly, as we have come into the crisis, it opened our eyes to opportunities that we can go after and inefficiencies that we have throughout the income statement. So, let me talk about a couple of those. Now obvious ones you would expect obviously our travel budgets with operating 200 countries around the world were significant.  And the digital transformation that we\u2019ve been under and in connecting everyone digitally and our ability to day one moved to a virtual workforce have allowed us to obviously save, substantive amount of money on the travel side and there is no question that behavior and from what we\u2019ve learned will to continue to deliver savings for us moving forward and we will how we think about that. There is no better way than to learn the polls of a business and being on the ground and that\u2019s the big part of who are as a company, but we\u2019ve learned to use virtual tools in a very different way whether it\u2019s technology that we have in our plants, where we don\u2019t have to spend maintenance people to the plants anymore that they can work through different systems to see actually at what point on in a plant virtually and address issues from thousands of miles away versus getting on an airplane to having business review meetings with teams. So we are getting better and better of that and I think that behavior will continue.  Portfolio, obviously, going into this, we always have a long tail and we\u2019ve had this strategy that we\u2019ve been executing for the last couple of years and grow the head and cut the tail and as we went into the crisis, obviously cutting the tail became essential in order to meet the demand and that has allowed our \u2013 out in the throughput and the efficiencies and to case fill on our plants to grow quite significantly.  And there is a lot of learning there. Now we have cut some SKUs that have very select and unique consumers that we need to look to how we ultimately optimize moving forward. But I do not anticipate that we\u2019ll get back to the full breadth of the portfolio that we had before, as we work with the trade to really optimize it.  And then secondly, I think, what we\u2019ve learned a lot is how do you manage on omni-channel environment and do that in an effective way that it allows us to map the consumer journey, understand where those unique consumers are and if they are unique and they are shopping online, perhaps we expand the tail online versus doing it through the brick and mortar shelf and we\u2019ve learned to leverage that more effectively as we move forward.  And the other area would certainly be on \u2013 and looking at the overall cost structures of our offices and what we are doing around the world and making sure that we think about them differently in the long-term to ensure that we maximize effectiveness of our teams on the ground and we are looking at the cost in a way that we have an opportunity to potentially generate some savings there.  And then the last is obviously, elevating funding to growth. And as we look at our products and our innovation strategy, we are looking at more platform ideas, Lauren, across the board, where we are getting more synergies with respect to our formulation development and using that more successfully on a global platform. The last would be a strategy that is now underway being led by our supply chain, which is really looking at its segmentation of our facilities little bit differently and that\u2019s taking big facilities and making them even more efficient in the long run and looking at how we use other facilities that will become far more agile and flexible to deal with smaller runs, to deal with innovation very differently, to deal with direct-to-consumer brands that we maybe incubating and do that in a very cost-effective way and complementing that, excuse me \u2013 with a \u2013 manufacturers whereas they might be more efficient.  So, a multitude of things on the productivity side, Lauren and I think you will continue to hear more about that as we move forward. Operator : And our next question will come from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. And congratulations on the strong results. Noel, I wanted to pick up on Jason English\u2019s line of questioning around the decision, specifically around Latin America, but mine is really around the decision not to reinstitute guidance and the takeaway here for investors.  So, understanding that LATAM is a bigger portion of your portfolio relative to the peer set, I know it\u2019s not lost from you guys that, we\u2019ve seen Kimberly Clark and Procter and Church and Dwight this morning reinstitute the practice that Procter is looking out in the entire fiscal year with their guidance. John gave a number of directional guidance points, if you will, strong organic sales growth in the first half of the year, but basically through July. I think the tone on the call here has been pretty positive and it sounds like you guys are going to be resuming share repurchases. So, that\u2019s all a big wind up here. How much do you guys deliberate on this?  What are you seeing in July, specifically? And is the message here, really this is more about conservatism related to the pandemic and probably specifically Latin America as opposed to any sort of sequential weakness in July that the market should be concerned about? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Let me start with July. We are going to avoid getting into a precedent despite the fact that I am very sensitive and understand in the absence of guidance that externally everyone is looking for more and more information. But what we don\u2019t want to do is get into every earnings call talking about the current month that we are in. I will say that July is coming in as planned. Relative to guidance again, not much to add versus what you have in the print. Specifically, the unknowns of the unknowns, I mean, we\u2019ve seen anything versus where we were in the first quarter, we\u2019ve seen the virus unfortunately expand. We\u2019ve seen case counts accelerate, particularly in some of our larger markets. We see increasingly more disruptions in some of those markets relative to retail closures.  At least temporary closures. We\u2019ve seen consumer behavior modify, which has manifested its way through a significant volatility from week-to-week in the categories which makes it very difficult to predict and plan effectively. So, with that as the backdrop, we continued to hold our position in that regard.  And we understand moving forward that we would prefer to provide guidance and as we get more and more information and get more confidence, in terms of the way we see things moving, we will certainly come back and have that discussion again. Operator : And next we will hear from Bill Chappell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead. Keaton Green : Hi. This is Green on for Bill. Thanks for taking my question. I had one on Hill\u2019s and specifically the volume growth hoping you guys could kind of break that out a little bit more. Is it more consumers coming into the franchise from, perhaps a different brand? Are you seeing more consumers adding dogs to defending their households and they have increased consumption at home?  And then kind of looking out going forward, how do you see that growth playing out over the kind of remainder of the year, the next few years when you step up investment and kind of the momentum that you have going right now. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Great. Thanks, Bill. So, Hill\u2019s, another very strong quarter and again, let\u2019s come back to the fundamentals. Great core innovation behind the Science Diet relaunch which continues to perform extremely well. And is now at the tail end of its global roll out and getting significantly stepped up advertising support behind that.  We\u2019ve seen the adjacencies as we moved into fast-growing segments, particularly the West segment which has been quite buoyant around the world. And obviously the channel expansion strategy that we\u2019ve seen that we\u2019ve executed across the Colgate business was in very much - was led by the learning that we have coming out of the Hill\u2019s business, their ecommerce business is up another 50%, shares are up.  We are getting better and better at understanding that channel, particularly around the digital complements that come behind that. You saw a significant step-up in advertising investment in the quarter. We will see that level of spending continue in the back half of the year, specifically behind the following fundamentals.  This brand continues to have very, very low brand awareness, 3% as an example in the U.S. So our ability to continue to drive awareness behind the premium aspects of the brand and the science and the biology-based nutrition is a significant growth opportunity for the business. And we\u2019ve done that. The advertisement has allowed us to expand \u2013 get more distribution in our portfolio. Obviously, look at other rapidly growing channels and drive distribution there and continuing to premierize and take pricing where we can. So the volume growth has been a function of obviously the share growth that we\u2019ve seen, the cannel growth that we\u2019ve seen, the premiumization, which obviously comes through more on pricing.  And likewise, you did see a little bit of pantry loading in the first quarter as consumers were facing a potential lockdown, particularly in North America, we did see some elevated purchases that we saw start to come out, In the second quarter, anticipate that we\u2019ll see a little bit more of that come out in the second half.  But by and large, the business is pretty solid. Looking longer term, obviously continued strong innovation, particularly behind our prescription diet business, looking at new digital platforms that we\u2019ve talked about the Hill\u2019s is a home idea which is allowing that to provide their pet owners with supply of our product delivered directly to their home. So, looking through different innovation ideas, where there is using digital platforms or innovating across our prescription diet business in the back half and moving into 2021, that will be the key focus for that business moving forward. So, again, strong fundamentals behind that business. Pet ownership, you\u2019ve seen the pet adoption accelerate significantly in the first half of the year.  Our estimation is that will slow quite a bit in the back half, but there is no question there are more dogs to be fed and that we are going to do everything we can to ensure that they are feeding them Hill\u2019s. Operator : And our next question will come from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Thanks. And good morning everybody. I wanted to ask a related question on the guidance and then kind of a related equally from that. So, I just I am still struggling a little bit with why you are not providing guidance, I obviously get \u2013 what\u2019s going on in the world, but what is different that you are seeing?  Or what is more difficult in terms of looking out that gives you pause to the seven months for the year as your \u2013 kind of how we see it and sort of related to that, maybe one of the thesis that we hear from folks most often on the stocking. The story is your market share continues to underperform. So, are those two somewhat related?  Do you have some sort of visibility on the market share begins to improve. I guess some of that has to do with translation on foreign exchange that should \u2013 in theory now start to look better as $1 million with where it is.  So maybe, kind of first comment to the second point and really kind of how do you think about the market share trends progressing as we move over the next kind of six to twelve months as much as you can provide, that would be helpful? Noel Wallace : Thanks, Mark. Let me come back again on the guidance question. Not much more to add there. But, let me assure the team, there is tremendous complexity and volatility week-to-week based on what\u2019s happening with COVID. And you get decisions made in countries, whether it\u2019s shutting down borders, you have an incredibly complex supply chain.  Second and third order derivative effects of implications in one market to another. You\u2019ve obviously seen the escalation of case counts in big markets for us, mainly Brazil, India and Mexico. And all of those are very difficult to predict and they are all kind of intertwined. And when you get the triangulation of those, it creates significant uncertainty relative to how things can unfold.  That being said, we are executing against it very well, but I assure you there is a lot of work that goes behind the day-to-day in making sure that we continue to operate and deal with the circumstances that confront us. And those circumstances make it very difficult to predict exactly which ways things are going to go. So, not much more to add on the guidance question.  On market share, overall market shares, we are okay in the quarter, but we are not that pleased quite frankly. Yes, you mentioned the translation impact. That was a big impact on our total shares, obviously with LATAM having such strong shares.  Their shares were actually up half a share point in the year-to-date basis, but given the translation impact of those currencies on a global basis, we saw our shares come down. U.S., a little soft in the quarter. I talked a little bit about pulling back on some promotions. Now we feel comfortable with where we are relative to the promotional environment.  There was some \u2013 still surprising me some aggressive couponing going on that we quite frankly didn\u2019t follow and that we would like to try to avoid in the future as we don\u2019t think that\u2019s an effective use of money. But we have the right promotions generated through our revenue management efforts that we see ready to go in the back half, but coupled with strong innovation. I would say that the launch of Optic White Renewal in the U.S. has been very, very successful. I mentioned earlier that\u2019s our first $7 price point, hit a two share, 50% of that incremental. It\u2019s been the most successful new product launch in the category since the launch of Optic White ten years ago.  So again, I think we are getting great confidence in our ability to premiumize the category and as we move into a more recessionary environment as we discussed earlier, we\u2019ll have a strong base business and a strong core innovation of plan to address that. If you look across the other categories, by and large pretty good share performance.  Many of those categories quite frankly driven \u2013 share driven by demand and the ability to supply the shelves, whether it would be liquid hand soap, or dish which we have not necessarily met the demand at this stage and share has suffered a little. But where we are focused and where we are spending our money, we are getting some share growth.  We are not pleased quite frankly with some of the share performance in the U.S. But again, we believe that was somewhat circumstantial and we got strong plans and investment in the back half to change that. Operator : And our final question will come from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. I am wondering if we can kind of dial back to some of the pre-COVID priorities that you had, just to kind of get a sense of how you are doing on those as the world changed and specifically, some of the premiumization efforts outside of the U.S., the competition against local natural brands in China and India, the expansion of the Elmex, Meridol basically, if you could give us a rundown of those initiatives and have you maintained kind of the foot on the pedal on those?  How are you doing? And are they still as relevant as before? Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Rob. And then, good morning. So, again, I talked about, we expect the strategy that we had put in place 18 months ago, quite frankly as we went to the crisis and interrogated that we felt it was perfectly suited for the behaviors and the dynamics we were seeing in the category. I mean, we needed to continue and they are behind the core business.  The adjacencies were there and that allows us to rethink some of our core businesses and how we get into rapidly growing segments. Take floor cleaners where we\u2019ve expanded the portfolio into more hygiene anti-bacterial related product. And likewise, the focus we were on for quite some time to truly elevate our digital commerce business and you\u2019ve seen consistent growth both from a top-line performance, as well as share performance in ecommerce.  And a lot of that capability is being driven by the success we\u2019ve had in Hill\u2019s and obviously ramping up capabilities across the company both in the digital area as well as the ecommerce space and that we\u2019ve done that through developing our internal talent, as well as bringing in outside talent that we think has been a real boost for the organization to help us think a little bit differently.  So, strategy working and nothing that we feel we need to change, continue to be agile as we move forward. I think some of the learning we\u2019ve had on the agility side as it we can innovate much, much faster than we have in the past. And that we intend to systemize that as we move forward to make sure that we capture that learning on an ongoing basis.  Premiumization has been a big part. I mentioned earlier in the call, we do roughly 50% of our toothpaste business in mid-price and another 25% in value and the balance in premium. And if you take the premium, the fastest growing part of the market has been the ultra-premium where we have not competed. The launch of Optic While Renewal is an example at $7 taking that bundle and moving that around the world is an opportunity for us. And I think it has certainly given us confidence, notwithstanding the fact that it is tough to launch premium bundle successful, but given us confidence we have now a lot of the capabilities necessary to push more aggressively on premium. And we\u2019ve learned throughout the history and particularly with the last recession, 2008, 2009, you may recall Rob that one of the most successful launches during that period was Optic White.  And that was an affordable luxury and we understand that there still is a segment of the market looking for premium, value-oriented bundles that provide a significant point of difference and Renewal is one. And so, we will balance that very carefully as we move into a more challenged macro environment and we\u2019ll do that with super premium innovation in the right markets, as well as continuing to focus on our core.  On naturals, to your question there, we are excited about our natural strategy. Tom\u2019s has got some terrific plans ahead of it with Craig and Dubitsky and Lauri and the team from Hello are doing an outstanding job opening our eyes the opportunities in naturals across the category. The Hello brand continue to expand in the U.S. and is delivering nice growth and I think that category we know long-term will be very, very beneficial.  Consumers continue to be extremely interested in purpose-driven brands, particularly brands with a strong sustainability profile and while the short-term in the crisis we saw a fall-off of natural brands. We\u2019ve seen that category start to rebound and we expect longer term, it will continue to be a healthy growth opportunity for us. Your last comment I think was on the Elmex expansion. Again, as we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve been very selective with that strategy and where we move Elmex and Meridol into markets with high pharmacy retail environments and we are doing that very successfully. Brazil was the early launch, Great results coming out of that through the pharmacy expansion plan we have there.  This is not a short-term volume strategy. We want to build a long-term therapeutic business in the pharmacy channel and doing that with strong therapeutic brands like Elmex and Meridol and you are going to see that continue to unfold as we increase investment and continue to build a long-term sustainable business for the markets where we extend it. That will have a couple more to expand in as we move into 2021. So, hopefully, that answers your question, Rob.  And I guess, that brings us to the end. So let me just sum it up. I think overall, a quality quarter, but we all recognize, we\u2019ve got more work to do and a lot of challenges still in front of us. I want to thank 36,000 Colgate people around the world who continue to be extraordinarily resilient, well-focused on executing our strategy, building new capabilities across the organization and winning on the ground and the success of the quarter goes out to them.  So, thanks everyone and we look forward to catching up with everyone soon. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, John Faucher. Please go ahead. John Faucher : Thanks, Amanda. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's Web site for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's Web site. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Henning Jakobsen, Chief Financial Officer. I will provide commentary on our Q3 performance and full year guidance before turning it over to Noel for his thoughts on how we are planning to sustain our growth momentum into 2021. We will then open it up for Q&A. As usual, we request that you limit yourselves to one question, so that as many people as possible get to ask a question. If you have further questions, you are welcome to reenter the queue. We delivered very strong results in the third quarter consistent with our focus on generating sustainable profitable growth. We delivered both volume and pricing growth. We delivered growth in all four of our categories; oral care, personal care, home care and pet nutrition. And we delivered organic sales growth in every division. Developed markets organic sales growth was 6.5% and emerging markets organic sales growth was 8.5%. The choices we have made in terms of revamping our innovation processes, continuing to drive our digital transformation and investing in our brands are paying off. And as Noel will discuss, we have further opportunities ahead of us. Importantly, this growth is driving our P&L. Our ability to expand our growth margins helped us deliver a double digit percentage increase in base business earnings per share despite continued increased investment in advertising, negative foreign exchange, cost associated with the COVID crisis and headwind from higher logistics costs. Our net sales grew 5.5% in the quarter. Organic sales growth of 7.5% was driven by 3% organic volume growth and the 4.5% increase in pricing. The acquisitions of Filorga, Hello and the Nigerian joint venture added an additional 200 basis points to volume growth, while foreign exchange was a 4% headwind. Our gross profit margin was 61.2%, up 220 basis points year-over-year on both the GAAP and a base business basis. On a base business basis, this was our best year-over-year performance in several years. For the third quarter, pricing was 170 basis points favorable to gross margins while raw materials were a 230 basis point headwind, driven by increases in raw materials like fats and oils and the transactional impact from foreign exchange. Productivity was a 250 basis point benefit, while other was plus 30 basis points. On a GAAP basis, our SG&A was up 20 basis points as a percent of sales. On a base business basis, our SG&A was up 90 basis points on a percent of sales basis driven by a 70 basis point increase in advertising for sales as our advertising spending was up 13% year-over-year on an absolute basis, and by a moderate increase in logistics costs as a percent of sales, as we work to meet heightened demand due to COVID-19. On a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 19% year-over-year, while it was up 11% on a base business basis. Our EPS was up 21% on a GAAP basis and up 11% on a base business basis. We continue to deliver free cash flow growth in the quarter, up 5% year-over-year and up 29% year-to-date. We resumed share repurchases during the quarter as well. And now I have a few comments on our divisional performance. North America delivered strong growth in the quarter, driven by a combination of pricing and volume growth. Oral care growth was driven by toothpaste and improved performance in toothbrushes, aided by the launch of our hum by Colgate electric brush later in the quarter. The focus on premium innovation like hum by Colgate, Colgate Optic White Renewal toothpaste, and the Colgate Optic White Overnight Teeth Whitening Pen helped to drive strong pricing growth in oral care. Our personal care and home care businesses continue to benefit from COVID-related demand, particularly in liquid hand soap and dish soap, although our skin health businesses were a drag on growth in the quarter. Overall, we are seeing promotional levels in our categories returning to normal, and we have planned for that to continue going forward. We were very pleased with our performance in Latin America in the third quarter. Latin American net sales were down 5% in the quarter as 2% volume growth and 9.5% pricing growth were offset by significant foreign exchange headwinds. We delivered organic sales growth in every hub in the division, including strong growth in Mexico and Brazil. Volume performance for the division improved sequentially as we return to a more normalized promotional cadence due to higher consumer foot traffic. And we saw benefits from a strong innovation calendar and increased demand for personal and home care products due to COVID. Our innovation in naturals and whitening across the division is helping to drive premiumization in toothpaste as part of our revenue growth management strategy. Our Protex brand is benefiting from heightened consumer interest in antibacterial products, the re-launch of Protex with the new flaxseed oil formula, and the entry into new segments with products like Protex Face in Brazil. Protex is a great example of driving growth in both the core and in higher growth adjacent segments. Europe delivered double digit net sales growth in the quarter. Organic sales growth at 3% was primarily driven by volume growth, as retail foot traffic improved and slightly positive pricing. Net sales also benefited from the inclusion of Filorga and favorable foreign exchange. Organic sales growth benefited from strong performance in personal care, driven by COVID-related demand and strength of the Sanex brand behind Sanex Zero% and Sanex Dermo product line. Oral care performance improved sequentially as we saw less pantry destocking and also through increased brand support. We returned to net sales growth in Asia Pacific in the third quarter. Organic sales growth of 4.5% was driven by a mixture of volume and pricing growth. The organic sales growth was driven by our biggest hubs, with Greater China, India and South Pacific all growing year-over-year. Our Colgate China business continues to benefit from the premium innovation Noel had talked about at the Barclays Conference in September, while our South Pacific business delivered continued strong performance through COVID-related demand and innovation. Africa/Eurasia also returned to net sales growth in the quarter, as mid-single digit volume and pricing growth were only partially offset by a low-double digit foreign exchange headwind. Organic growth was broad based, with growth in all three categories and across every hub. Turkey continues to benefit from strong growth across all categories. Hill\u2019s once again delivered stellar results with double digit net and organic sales growth led by the U.S., Europe, Australia and Canada. Higher consumer demand in e-commerce continues to be a significant driver of growth, although brick and mortar growth in the U.S. improved sequentially in the third quarter as foot traffic increased. Sales continues to benefit from increased brand support, which is driving higher brand awareness and market share gains on our wellness products. The pet channel remains subdued due to COVID headwinds. The prescription diet sales growth was robust, given the shift to e-commerce. And now I\u2019ll move to guidance. We are providing annual guidance despite the fact that rising case rates are rising in many of our markets. We still believe the government actions to control the spread of COVID-19 are the biggest risk to delivering on our financial plan. And shutdowns, like we saw in China and India earlier in the year, meaning significant impacts to our ability to manufacture and distribute our products are not built into our forecast. I want to note that we will not be providing any discussion of 2021 guidance at this time. We expect net sales to be at mid-single digits for the year. Organic sales are expected to be up at the high end of mid-single digits. Foreign exchange is expected to be a mid-single digit headwind for the year with current spot rates putting us towards the lower end of that range. We expect gross margin expansion for the full year and advertising as a percent of sales is expected to be up for the year with an even larger increase in advertising year-over-year in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, our tax rate is expected to be in the range of 21.5% to 22%. On a base business basis, our tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23.5% to 24%. Our share repurchase plans remain unchanged as we plan for less benefit from share repurchase this year, as we pay down debt. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to be up double digits. On a base business basis, we would expect earnings per share to be up 6% to 7%. And now, I'll turn it over to Noel. Noel Wallace : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone is doing well and staying safe. I'll keep my comments quite brief this morning so we have plenty of time to get to the Q&A. Clearly, we're pleased with the results in Q3 and obviously the progress we've made throughout the year. I think the results speak to the tremendous work of Colgate people and our partners when you think about it from our labs, to the production lines, to our DCs, to getting product in stores, and the incredible work our teams are doing working virtually all over the world. In that regard, our teams continue to show incredible strength. Their compassion for driving the business forward, the collaboration they're showing and importantly, the discipline and professionalism behind the strategy is clearly reflected in the results. So my immense gratitude from all of us to the teams on the ground and their families. So John summarized the results I think quite well. And because the quarter, to some extent, speaks for itself, I'll keep my comments quite brief again, and I'll focus on where we're going next. You've heard me say many times that our growth mindset is really about delivering sustainable, profitable growth and you clearly saw that. While the trends related to COVID have certainly boosted our sales, organic sales growth turnaround was well on its way as we headed into 2020. So as we look at 2021 and beyond, we'll continue to evolve our strategies to deliver this type of growth that you expect and obviously, growth that drive superior shareholder value. To that point, I want to expand on three areas this morning; revamping our innovation process, you've heard me talk about that quite a bit, our digital transformation, which is well underway and then clearly investing differently to build our brands in the current environment. So first, let me start off by revamping our innovation process. You will recall, we talked quite a bit about that at Barclays and we focused on delivering that strategy through the quarter. It's about delivering transformative and disruptive innovation across our entire portfolio. So to do this, we need to become less reliant on line extensions and by pursuing innovations that really build incremental category growth and market share gains, which is ultimately vital for us to continue to drive gross margin. And we see incredible opportunities, quite frankly, across the mega trends all over the world that we're seeing on the ground. Naturals and sustainability to give an example, the urbanization that we're seeing in big markets, aging population in developed markets, or younger population and per capita consumption opportunities in developing countries and clearly the rapid growth and channel focus that we have, as we've seen channel expansions, particularly in e-commerce and pharmacy for us. But you can imagine these demands new skill sets and new incentives, new structures and new processes to get it right. We brought an outside talent to help us change how we think about innovation, and we're really encouraged by the risk taking and collaboration that the teams are showing. We're encouraged by the new financial models and approach they're taking to innovation and empowering our teams importantly on the ground to take action. So not surprisingly, Colgate people are clearly stepping up and embracing the change that we're trying to implement. In the last six months, we've launched the Hum Smart toothbrush, the Miracle Repair toothpaste line and serums, the Colgate Optic White Whitening Pen and the Hill\u2019s Science Diet Perfect Digestion just to give you a few examples of that. John mentioned Protex, another great example of how we're changing the way we innovate. While it's a brand you're probably less familiar with, it has a strong antibacterial skin health credential. Before COVID, we felt the segment was becoming highly commoditized and overly promotional, and we were highly dependent on line extensions. So what did we do? We focused on real differentiation for the brand. We re-launched the entire core line of Protex bar soap through the flaxseed-based antibacterial formula. That flaxseed oil boosts your natural skin defenses, which is a really interesting idea in the current environment, particularly in Brazil and has truly differentiated us in this environment and we think positions us well for growth moving forward. We also at the same time launched a line of Protex face products, which is positioned in the premium anti-acne segment, a high growth adjacency for sure and we're driving incremental sales, share and margin for the brand with that innovation. So while in the short term we're benefiting from some of the COVID-related demand in this space, I believe this innovation leaves us well positioned to continue to drive incremental category growth and share for our business. So next, we're continuing to drive our digital transformation. You've heard me talk a lot about that over the last six to nine months. And we're making great progress. So what do I mean when I talk about digital? It's about changing how we work every day across the company. We\u2019ve discussed our move to SAP S/4HANA, which is allowing us now to analyze our business all over the world effectively with one global standard. We're also now installing new systems to accelerate our revenue growth management efforts. It's about changing how we interact as well with our customers and consumers. We\u2019re generating much better insights through data and analytics, which allows us to better understand the consumer path to purchase. As an example, in Hill\u2019s from pet adoption to the first vet visits into their ability to buy product ultimately in store. So really understanding that entire journey is allowing us to drive far more growth and efficiencies with our media and as well as with our partners. It's about changing how we execute our communication as well. We're improving our digital marketing through programmatic media buying, to more personalized content and we're doing testing that allows us to more accurately predict the effectiveness of our media driving higher ROI in the end. So starting small and scaling rapidly is a big mindset that we've adopted in our digital strategy. Channel wise, the biggest beneficiary of our digital media investments is clearly e-commerce and we're developing much more sophisticated content to draw attention, increase consideration for our brands, ultimately secure the purchase and importantly, earn loyalty for our brands going forward. And that's driving share gains in key markets, particularly in the U.S. and in China as we've increased our investment in that area. We'll also continue to build the digital muscle across the entire enterprise. That's really important for us. And if you think about marketing to a consumer on Amazon or Alibaba, it's not the same or marketing to a consumer on Tesco.com or through the last milers [ph] in Latin America. This is where the focus on deeply understanding the consumer journey will truly pay off for us. So we need to make sure we build flexibility into our model and win across all the different platforms. While e-commerce requires some specialization, and we brought in the talent to do that, we need to ensure that we have training across the entire organization to raise the skill level to ensure that we build that muscle for the long term. I talked about innovation and I've talked about our digital transformation, so let me talk a little bit about brand investment. We\u2019re spending behind ideas now and capabilities that will broaden the growth in our portfolio in terms of the brands, the categories, likewise the channels which we just spoke about, and the geographies. Our innovation will be more successful if we invest in marketing that lets consumers know what's truly different, and we're very focused on that. We'll also win in e-commerce if we\u2019re more consistently at the top of the first page and delivering the right personalized content. In our revenue growth management strategy in driving premiumization will also be more successful if our advertising clearly demonstrates our products are delivering excellent value. And we\u2019ll continue to keep Colgate as the most penetrated brand in the world at over 60% of households by consistently keeping our brand top of mind and preferred. So these changes I've discussed today are already helping us deliver the better results that you've seen throughout the year. The success of Optic White renewal we talked about is a great example of pairing the right innovation with the right digital strategy with increased brand levels of support. The Hill's Science Diet re-launched has fueled a lot of the growth at Hill\u2019s, likewise a good example of that. So all these efforts are paying off for us as we head into 2021 and building the momentum throughout the year. And we believe that we\u2019ll continue to drive the growth, particularly as we build those skill sets across the organization for the longer term. So before we move into the Q&A, I want to offer a word about our announcement this morning that Stan Sutula will be joining the company on November 9 as our Chief Financial Officer. Stan joins us from Pitney Bowes and previously IBM and brings a wealth of experience in finance and strategy to this role. We're excited to welcome Stan to Colgate and think his experience in building technology-related businesses will add a tremendous value to our digital transformation well underway. Henning Jakobsen will retire from Colgate on December 31 and we are grateful that he's going to stay with us to ensure a smooth transition with Stan throughout the balance of the year before returning to his family in Denmark. Henning\u2019s been with us for 25 years and the service to our company has been exceptional. Henning has served in a number of general management and finance roles throughout the globe. Henning\u2019s contributed too much to Colgate not just in the finance function as an executive but also a thoughtful business leader across the leadership team. Most recently, he has been instrumental in our efforts to drive organizational efficiency. I especially want to thank him for his help in my transition to CEO over the past few years. And behalf of all of us at Colgate, we wish him and his family all the best. And with that, I'll open it up to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hi. Good morning. Noel Wallace : Good morning, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So corporate pricing was very strong in the quarter, really the best result we've seen in a decade. Latin America is strong in the second straight quarter [indiscernible] improved sequentially. So two parts to the question. A, just short term, can you give us a sense for how much of that strength is due more to list price increases that are more enduring versus short-term changes in promotional cadence and what you're seeing on promotion from a competitive standpoint? But really, Noel, I was interested more in the longer term and taking a step back and thinking about pricing as a strategic lever. It does seem pretty audacious the level of pricing you took in Latin America during the pandemic and obviously volumes seems to have held up well. You can argue that\u2019s the case globally also. So sort of kudos for the success, but help us understand what's enabling the higher pricing and if the recent success emboldens you at all in terms of how you think about pricing and your approach going forward? Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Dara. Let me take the \u2013 obviously, a two-part question. The short term, easy to answer. Obviously, as we've seen significant foreign exchange, we have consistently communicated externally that the important objective of our general managers on the ground is recouping the transactional impacts of foreign exchange. And what\u2019s particularly pleasing, as you pointed out, is Latin America following strong pricing in the second quarter at 9% delivered another 9% pricing in the third quarter in parallel with getting volume back into the business. So, again, I think a great result to see the volume coming back in Latin America, behind two quarters of strong pricing and obviously delivering the margin that was required to sustain the higher advertising levels in that division, which is certainly playing out. So short term, it was a combination of list and promotional pricing to a certain extent, but very much a lot of the revenue growth management discipline that we're putting in place around the world. And Latin America, as an example, has done an exceptional job as has Europe, as has Asia in bringing in competencies to ensure that our teams on the ground are really digging deep into our promotional spending and working together with our trade partners to find ways to drive both category and revenue for ourselves. And I'm particularly encouraged with some of the analytics coming out of the revenue growth management teams around the world. And you're seeing some of the short-term benefits of that, and that will clearly play out for the longer term. So if I take a step back now on the longer-term question, listen, getting a pricing into the P&Ls and in the categories is a critical initiative for us. We will continue to find ways to do that with the mechanisms that we have through revenue growth management. Obviously, list price is one of them. But long term, we continue to see opportunities to get pricing up in the markets. We've long talked about the under index of Colgate toothpaste portfolio. We still have an opportunity to drive a lot more premiumization there. You've heard us talk quite consistently about the importance of premiumization across our innovation pipelines and a lot of the innovation that we put into the market in the third quarter, likewise, was very premium-based. I used the example of Protex acne, the acne line in Brazil, all premium priced. We launched the Whitening Pen in the U.S. premium priced; Optic White Renewal, lower ounces but very premium priced as well. So again, I think as the long-term strategy, we continue to find pricing as a key mechanism within our P&L, and it's obviously integral to the fact that the gross margin expansion you saw in the quarter is allowing us to continue to invest more aggressively behind a quite plentiful pipeline of new products. Operator : And our next question will come from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. Congrats on the results. So if you can help us reconcile the volume growth in basically shipments to fulfill and reset \u2013 not reset, but replenish the shelves vis-\u00e0-vis what consumption was? And then on your last comment, Noel, on, for instance, Latin America, how much do you think is premiumization basically mix, vis-\u00e0-vis just plain pricing? Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks for the question. Obviously, again \u2013 let me take the Latin America question first. The strategy that we've been talking for quite some time is obviously getting the core businesses re-launched that allows us to take pricing, moving into adjacencies and premium brands that allows us to obviously premiumize the category and get more margin growth. Looking at certain channel expansion opportunities, particularly across the pharmacy channel, which allows for more premium therapeutic portfolios to get sold through the consumer base there. So all those elements have helped Latin America, as an example, drive the margin growth, drive the pricing in the quarter and there's no question that that strategy that we've been deployed throughout the year continues to take hold through all the divisions. Let me take the question about replenishment. It really has \u2013 it's a function of more the markets where we've seen significant demand in some of our categories. So if I take North America as an example, liquid hand soap, dish continues to be about replenishing the shelves. The demand is in excess of some of the capacity that we had in the third quarter. That's starting to reduce itself as we move into the fourth quarter as we improve our capacity. But we still have some opportunities to replenish shelves. We're still trying to meet some of the excess demand that we have there. But by and large, a good portion of the volume in certain categories only. Now it's not the case in oral care where we're not seeing obviously COVID drive a lot of extra purchases or behavior changes, and we had good volume growth on oral care through the quarter. And again, I think that's a result of the innovation strategy that we're putting in place as well as the increased investment. Operator : And our next question will come from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Please go ahead. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. Good morning. My question is on Hill\u2019s. Number one, I know you won't give guidance for 2021, but just as we think about kind of underlying trends in that business, I'm just wondering if you can sort of parse out for us how much is being driven by category growth versus market share gains? Because I assume all of those people who have adopted pets during COVID, they're not going to give them up next year. So I'm sort of assuming that the robust category growth will continue. Is there any reason you would disagree with that? And then if you'll indulge me, just because I think it is a big deal, this is the first time we've seen Colgate hire a senior person externally in a while. And I'm just wondering, Noel, as you settle in and you think about sort of the organization and the culture of the company, is this the beginning of maybe more new blood coming into Colgate or was this just a specific value you thought was right for the role of CFO and it's kind of a one-off? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. Let me address the Hill\u2019s questions first. Listen, Hill\u2019s continues to hit on all cylinders. We've talked a lot about big core renovations, which obviously have played out very nicely. We've talked about the premiumization aspect and going into adjacencies, which continues to be an emerging growth segment if you take the wet side of the business and they\u2019re doing an exceptional job of capitalizing on those trends. We talked about the low brand awareness that Hill\u2019s has and obviously the significant upside that still exists as we expand or increase our advertising spend to drive relevance to the brand. We talked a lot about the channel expansion opportunities. They've done an exceptional job with e-commerce. All of that is leading to increased market share is when you take the e-commerce shares, when you take brick and mortar shares around the world. All-in-all, we're driving good share growth across that business. You mentioned obviously the pet adoptions are up significantly in the U.S. as a result of COVID. So we think that will obviously bode well for the category moving forward as we move into 2021, and we see the continued acceleration of pet adoptions, particularly in the current environment. So good category growth combined with good shared growth that's driven by an underlying strategy that's very solid. On your second question, listen, we have an opportunity to bring in someone with some really unique experience. We looked obviously at that opportunity very carefully. Particularly someone with Stan's background, the incredible experience he has at IBM as well as the transformation that he was helping drive at Pitney. And as I mentioned in my upfront comments, a big focus for us is really driving our digital transformation across the entire enterprise, not just from a consumer standpoint but how we operate internally, through our back office systems, through the technology that we use through SAP and the things that we're bringing on-stream as we speak and Stan is very well positioned to do that. And we will \u2013 as we look for opportunities to continue to elevate our skills as we think about our strategy moving forward, we'll identify candidates on the outside to do that. We've done that in the digital space very, very successfully. We've done that in the e-commerce space very, very successfully. That being said, we have an incredible pipeline of talent in the company. We're developing broad-based skills across the organization and we'll continue to obviously encourage and develop our talent from within, which has been a key success factor for the company for many, many years. Operator : And next, we will hear from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English : Hi. Good morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in. Much appreciate it. And Happy Friday too. So congratulations on great results. It's great to see the organic sales growth, gross margins phenomenal and the reinvestment in advertising, it\u2019s obviously welcome. As we walk through the P&L, we are seeing some more leakage though outside of just advertising in the SG&A, particularly in developed markets. I think in your 10-Q, you're citing overhead inflation as the drag of around 130 bps in Europe, 190 bps in North America. I know Europe\u2019s been running up all year, but North America looks like a sharp inflection. What's driving that? Is it reinvesting in capabilities? Is it underlying inflation? I wanted to just get some better understanding of where that margin pressure is coming from and how durable it may be? Noel Wallace : Yes. Listen, as John outlined, a lot of the SG&A increase is obviously largely driven by advertising. We had a little bit of an increase related to COVID-related costs in the quarter, related to some compensation costs in the quarter as well. But overall, we feel the overheads are well under control, well under control around the world. We're making the changes necessary. You mentioned, obviously, we're bringing in some skill sets as we just talked about with Wendy to certainly elevate our game in the digital and e-commerce space. But by and large, obviously the focus right now is continued to drive the gross margin as you saw, keep the overheads where they've been, and we've consistently \u2013 we find productivity opportunities in that area and invest behind the business. So, overall, we feel like we\u2019re in a good place, Jason. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll hear from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Obviously, a lot has happened in the last several months or so since the pandemic started to take hold and you\u2019ve launched a number of new products as well during that time. But you had already started to talk a lot more about innovation investments before COVID. So I\u2019m just kind of curious how the current environment has impacted your longer-term view and your strategy going forward obviously on oral care? But then also pet ownership has increased, so how is that impacting your innovation and your thought process with Hill\u2019s? And then soap\u2019s demand could be higher for quite some time. So just thinking through the innovation strategy and where you plan to spend in the pet given the changes over the last several months? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Olivia. So, if I go back to Barclays and quite frankly, if I go back to the last 12 to 18 months, we've talked a lot about how we're thinking about innovation and a real concerted effort to organize ourselves both from a structural standpoint as well as the processes and the resource allocation, moving away from those closed-in line extensions to more incremental breakthrough innovation. And that has been very deliberate and a very focused effort across every division in the world and we're starting to see obviously the benefits of that. But the intention is obviously it sets us up for long-term sustainable growth moving forward. If I take the current environment, clearly we have an opportunity to continue to drive premium pricing. And that's why a lot of our innovation, as I mentioned earlier, is on the premium side of the business and we're looking for ways to disrupt the category. We're looking for ways to think about oral health differently than just a toothpaste line extension. And you're starting to see that play out in some of our innovation in the quarter, particularly in North America. Relative to Hill\u2019s, interesting \u2013 obviously the Science Diet re-launch has been a big driver, but they're seeing great benefits coming through with some of the innovation they brought in, in early days on prescription diet with far more therapeutic formulas. Metabolic, as an example, is doing extremely well. And if you take some of the innovation opportunities that we see in the wet segment moving forward, we continue to find ample opportunities to drive growth with that. And as pet adoptions and pet ownership increases and clearly we're seeing the trend in the marketplace, likewise, with a move back to science-based, real biology-based products and that obviously plays very well for the Hill\u2019s business, both here in North America and around the world. And we have an innovation pipeline that is very, very robust as we look into 2021. The other aspect of that is certainly vet visits are down as a result of mobility issues in the U.S. related to COVID and the traffic is down. Our home is certainly a great innovative idea that we're bringing into that business to continue to allow vets to extend product to their pet owners directly. And we'll see that increase as we move into 2021, particularly as we see more and more traffic move back into the veterinary space going forward. Operator : And next, we will hear from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone and congratulations on the strong results. A question on gross margin with two components to it really, a more near-term aspect as well as a longer-term orientation. So, of course, it was historically good this core quarter. I think it was a high watermark for the company. And we talked about pricing in an earlier question. How did gross margins come in relative to your expectations? Did it beat the Street pretty handily? And I think it was largely on the pricing component as well as funding the growth. And so I'm not asking for guidance, but we have promo picking up, freight costs moving higher, commodities likely less favorable. Even without asking for guidance, how should we be thinking about this line item sort of in the intermediate term? And how is the Colgate company thinking about it? And then longer term, Noel, the 65% gross margin ambition would come up from time to time on these calls. Is that still realistic? Is that a significant priority for the company? And if so, how quickly do you think that you can get there? So thanks for that. Noel Wallace : Sure. Let me start. Again, take a step back and for us it's very much around focusing on growth. The growth moves through the P&L. We get increased margin dollars into the P&L. Obviously that allows us to support the businesses more consistently and more broadly as we've communicated in this quarter. You've seen four quarters now gross margins in the 60s and sequentially up from quarter-to-quarter. I think that's a result of a couple of things. One, a much deepened focus behind our revenue growth management. We've talked about that quite a bit. We\u2019ve talked about the importance of premium pricing and innovation that supports that. And we've talked about our ability to react quickly to extraordinary foreign exchange headwinds, as we've seen, both in Latin America and some of the markets in Africa and Middle East. And getting that into the P&L allows us to really control how we want to manage the business more effectively, how we want to spend the money both from below the line and above the line basis, how we want to look at our promotional strategy? So getting that gives us a tremendous amount of clarity on how we want to evolve in the quarter, and allows us to kind of dictate where we want to spend. Relative to the expectations and obviously the revenue growth management is coming in better than we expected; so a little bit better there. Funding the growth aspect continues to be very, very good. So if I walk through the margin roll forward again for you, we started \u2013 if we go back to third quarter last year at 59, we delivered 170 basis points of pricing off of \u2013 if you follow that off the second quarter, which was at 130 basis points. So again, solid pricing. But the quality of that pricing, again, to some of the earlier questions was consistent all around the world and by category, which was really nice to see. Funding the growth came in at 250, positive in the quarter offsetting material prices at 230. And obviously, that\u2019s a little bit of benefit from a mix, but not a lot. So again, coming down to 61.2, which is one of our \u2013 obviously our high point on the margin line, but we want to see that continue to grow. But first and foremost, it's about getting the top line continuing to sustain that healthy growth that you're seeing. That gives us the margin dollars and gives us the leverage. And ultimately, as we implement more discipline around revenue growth management, we take action quickly to offset foreign exchange, we see opportunities to continue to drive margin moving forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Thanks. Good morning. Can you go a little deeper into what you've seen in Latin America? I guess what's the \u2013 I believe we\u2019re looking for what's the most reassuring across your major markets in that region in the past few months? And what's allowed you to reinstate guidance for the fourth quarter when a quarter ago you didn't feel like you had that same visibility into the third quarter? Thanks. Noel Wallace : So, listen, we've got one quarter left. We\u2019re obviously just finishing up October. And we felt comfortable based on what we're seeing around the world. Obviously, case counts continue to be a real concern and will \u2013 inevitably, we could see more lockdowns in core markets around the world. And as a result of that, we want to be very cautious. But we felt pretty comfortable given the line of sight that we have on the business right now. And as a result, we gave guidance for the fourth quarter. We'll come back, as we always do, following the fourth quarter and provide you the necessary thoughts on 2021. But we're not getting ahead of ourselves yet. Right now, we're focused on delivering the fourth quarter and we'll talk 2021 at the appropriate time. Operator : Your next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Two things, one was just to follow up. You had mentioned freight in passing and I was just curious if you could give just a little bit more color on your outlook for freight in the U.S. and just a relevancy and kind of across the board. And then secondly, more specific to your business was thinking about promotions in the U.S. I think when you'd answered the question though about promotional activity and some of the resources you put in on revenue growth management, you highlighted other markets. In the U.S., Colgate historically has been a heavily promoted brand. So I was wondering to what degree the environment has given you an opportunity to accelerate efforts to kind of bring that down, or if this isn't really the right time, but I\u2019m curious on progress on that front in the U.S.? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Lauren. Let me take freight first. Freight obviously continues to be somewhat of a headwind, but we saw costs come in marginally better than they came in, in the second quarter. But that being said, a big caveat there is we see increasing case counts around the world that ultimately leads to more disruption along our lanes all around the world. So we're going to be very mindful as we see that unfold in the balance of the year. But so far, we've done a pretty good job in this quarter, mitigating some of the on costs associated with freight and logistics. On your question relative to the U.S., a lot of work on the U.S. around revenue growth management. That's the team that really embraces data and analytics. They've taken it on. I've talked about it I think over the last couple of quarters on how we're being far more disciplined, not only in categories where we're seeing excess demand, but more importantly not chasing a lot of the price promotions that have existed in some of the categories, particularly in toothpaste where we've seen high couponing from some of our competitors. We\u2019ve pulled back. We don't necessarily want to go after that consumer as much as we want to go after the premium consumer, which we believe has much more durability for the franchise moving forward. So we've been very mindful on our promotional spend in the quarter. That being said, as consumers come back into stores and store traffic increases, we want to be sure we're there and present. And we have the money in the P&L to adjust accordingly. But by and large, much more disciplined would be the message, RGM really taking on a new level of focus in the U.S., combined with obviously getting the dollar value of price increases that we're seeing through our revenue growth management initiatives playing through the P&L. Operator : And next, we will hear from Bill Chappell with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Bill Chappell : Thanks. Good morning. Noel Wallace : Good morning. Bill Chappell : Noel, can you just talk a little bit more about kind of what you're seeing on consumer habits, and presumably people aren't washing their hands or maybe even brushing their teeth as much as they were in March and April, and didn't know if you've seen that kind of flatten out to certainly an elevated level. And in that same line, since you gave fourth quarter guidance, what would you expect with the lockdowns in Europe, if you expect any kind of a spike back or if this is fairly different where you don't really expect a whole lot of surge in demand through another lockdown, especially in Europe. Noel Wallace : Yes. So, Bill, specifically on some of the more COVID-related categories that we've seen an increase in category growth, liquid hand soap would be one. Our research indicates clearly that behavior will stay, perhaps not at the current elevated levels but will certainly versus historical norms be at a higher level. Likewise, a lot more people obviously cooking at home, so dish liquid\u2019s been significantly accelerated. In that regard, I think as long as we see lockdowns, as long as we see people working from home, which in our estimation would be through at least half of next year, you'll continue to see elevated rates. You are not seeing a COVID-related impact on oral care. Obviously, if you see any panic buying going on in the market, you'll get a little bit of benefit. But I think consumers have adjusted themselves far better than at the onset of COVID to how they're managing their inventories and their pantries. So we wouldn't expect any significant changes on oral care. Likewise, on pet food, a little panic buying at the onset right now. I think it's more stabilized. Consumers understand what they have. Not a lot of destocking coming out of pantries. And I think more importantly, people are being more rational on how they manage their purchases. So for behavior change, liquid hand soap, certainly a change, dish liquid at least through the first half of next year and oral care starting to normalize coming out of the strong first quarter panic, but much more on a historical basis. And we're seeing good growth on the innovation side that's driving more category dollar growth, which is good to see. Operator : And next, we will hear from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. Based on the analytical work that we've done, we see a very high correlation between e-commerce penetration in terms of the category and gross margins, which would suggest \u2013 at least in the U.S. that would suggest that oral care could rapidly move to e-commerce. And so the question is, based on what you've learned and seen in China, are there things that you can do to be better prepared for that in the U.S. and how do you rank or how do you rate your ability and momentum in e-commerce in the U.S. if that happens? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Rob. You've heard me mention a couple of times the incredible digital and e-commerce capabilities that our Hill\u2019s business has and how important it is that we share learnings across the broader enterprise, and we very deliberately are shifting resources back and forth between Hill\u2019s and Colgate. We're obviously getting the same type of learning now out of Asia in terms of the skill sets. And as I mentioned, I think very deliberately in my comments, we feel very strongly that up-scaling the entire organization around e-commerce and that's not just our innovators, that's not our marketing and our customer development organization. That's everyone from logistics to supply chain to packaging. So everyone truly embraces and understands that channel, we think is very important to our long-term growth, as we see more and more consumers moving into that. So the skill sets are there. The transfer of knowledge is there. And I\u2019ve mentioned also that we're supplementing quite a bit of that by bringing in outside talent as well to ensure that we close any gaps that we might have in certain geographies around the world. You're seeing the benefits of that. Our e-commerce business obviously up, close to 50% in Q1; another close to 50% in Q2 and a very strong growth in Q3. Shares are up across our categories, both in North America as well as China, our two biggest markets. And we're seeing some accelerated growth, likewise, in Europe. Hill\u2019s obviously doing exceptionally well in this space. So we think we're well positioned, but we recognize we have a ways to go, given the opportunities we see to build the skill sets across the company and continue to grow market share where we're seeing significant growth. Operator : And we will take our final question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Thanks and good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask about market share. So I get the numbers in the release that are translating back into dollars, so mechanically it looks like you're losing share. But I guess maybe, is there any way to parse out share in some of the key markets on a local currency basis? And maybe more broadly, could you just talk about what you're seeing as growth within your categories globally at the high level, oral care, your segment of personal and household as well pet, and then directional comments on how your business is performing relative to those global growth rates? Noel Wallace : So, Mark, you\u2019ve identified obviously the impact of foreign exchange, so let me give you a shared summary on a constant currency basis. So year-to-date, we\u2019re flat or up in every single division, ex Asia. We've talked a lot about Asia obviously that we're in relooking at our go-to-market, our portfolio. We talked about the progress that we're making in the second quarter and we saw that playing through. Likewise, that progress accelerated in the third quarter. So we think we're well on our way there. But across the board, our shares are flat to up in every division on a constant currency basis. Last 13 weeks in North America, we've seen good progress on our toothpaste share, particularly as we've seen the investment behind renewal take hold and some of the other innovations that we've brought into the category. You look around the world, a lot of our focus on our premium business is in Europe, both meridol and elmex and the investment we're putting behind that, we're seeing some good growth. Good share growth in the very short \u2013 recent term in both Brazil and Mexico behind some of our innovations there. Mexico now back above an 80 share. And likewise, Brazil not chasing the bottom end of the market, but getting some good premium pricing, as we mentioned earlier, and seeing that translate into more sustainable share growth across the board. Relative to categories, by and large, most of the categories that we compete in have accelerated, obviously some COVID driven, others very pricing driven and from an innovation standpoint, toothpaste in the U.S. now back up into that four to six range on a year-to-date basis. Europe still around 0% to 2%, but again driven by some good pricing. Latin America, down a little bit versus 2019, but again I think driven by a real softness in the categories in the first and second quarters are starting to come back a little bit better in the third quarter, which is encouraging. So, overall, we\u2019ve got some good category growth. We talked Hill\u2019s, likewise, very good growth across the category. And Hill\u2019s and that team is very sustained no matter where you look at it around the world. So, overall, category seems pretty good right now. And I think with the innovation process we have in place and the focus on premiumization and revenue growth management, we\u2019ll continue to bring dollars into the categories in which we compete. So I guess that's the last question. Let me just close off by again thanking the Colgate people around the world on a really strong quarter and a continuation from the progress we've had over the last four to five quarters executing our strategy, building skill sets across the organization and obviously collaborating in ways that we've never collaborated before. So a great thanks to everyone. I wish all of you a safe and healthy Thanksgiving. And we look forward to catching up again on the fourth quarter results. So thanks, everyone. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. For opening remarks, I will turn the conference over to the Chief Investor Relations Officer, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John. John Faucher : Thanks Shannon. Good morning and welcome to our 2020 fourth quarter and year-end earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Joining me on the call this morning and Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stan Sutulla, Chief Financial Officer. I will provide commentary on our Q4 and full-year performance as well as our 2021 guidance before turning it over to Noel for his thoughts on how we are planning to sustain our growth momentum into 2021. We will then open it up for Q&A. As usual, we request that you limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible get to ask a question. If you have further questions, you are welcome to re-enter the queue. We finished 2020 in very strong fashion with our highest level of quarterly organic sales growth in over 10 years and our highest annual organic sales growth since the depths of the financial crisis. Importantly, we continued to deliver balanced growth which we think is the key to sustainable strong performance. For both the quarter and the year, we delivered both volume and pricing growth, organic growth in all four of our categories - oral care, personal care, home care, and pet nutrition, and organic sales growth in every division with both emerging markets and developed markets performing well. Our strategy to deliver more impactful premium innovation is still in its early stages, but we believe the results are beginning to show.  Importantly, this growth is driving our income statement. We delivered strong gross margin expansion for both the quarter and the year which allowed us to deliver profitable growth despite significant investments for future growth and the headwinds from foreign exchange.  Our net sales grew 7.5% in the quarter. Organic sales growth of 8.5% was driven by 5% organic volume growth and a 3.5% increase in pricing. The impact of acquisitions added an additional 100 basis points to volume growth while foreign exchange was a 2% headwind.  In the fourth quarter, our gross profit margin was 61.1% on both a GAAP basis, where were up 100 basis points year over year, and a base business basis where we were up 90 basis points. For the fourth quarter, pricing was 130 basis points favorable to gross margin while raw materials were a 320 basis point headwind driven by increases in the cost of raw materials, like pulling oils, and the transactional impact from foreign exchange. Productivity was a 280 basis point benefit. On a GAAP basis, our SG&A was up 260 basis points as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter and 100 basis points for the full year. On a base business basis, in the fourth quarter our SG&A was up 310 basis points on a percent of sales basis. This was primarily driven by a 210 basis point increase in advertising to sales as we drove strong activation on brand building, innovation and ecommerce. Our SG&A ratio was also impacted by increased logistics costs primarily in the U.S. and investments behind in growth and innovation. For the full year on a base business basis, our SG&A ratio was up 150 basis points driven primarily by a 100 basis point increase in advertising to sales and increased logistics costs. For the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 4% year-over-year while it was up 3% on a base business basis. Our EPS was flat on a GAAP basis and up 5% on a base business basis. For the full year, our EPS growth was 14% on a GAAP basis and 8% on a base business basis.  We delivered 18% growth in free cash flow for the full year. As we discussed at the beginning of 2020, we used some of the free cash flow to pay down debt primarily related to the Filorga transaction with the balance used for dividends and share repurchases. A few comments on our divisional performance. North America delivered 10% net sales and 8.5% organic sales growth in the quarter driven by premium innovation and increased consumption in categories impacted by the COVID pandemic. We also benefited from a rebound in performance by our skin health businesses in the quarter. Our ecommerce business in North America finished the year strongly with sales in the fourth quarter more than double last year\u2019s sales. North America saw significant increases in brand support behind the Hum by Colgate electric brush, the Colgate Optic White overnight teeth whitening pen, our toothpaste business, and Irish Spring. Latin America net sales were down low single digits as double-digit organic sales growth was more than offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange. The strong organic sales growth performance was broad-based as we delivered organic sales growth in every hub for both the quarter and the year. Oral care innovation has been a key growth driver with Colgate Total Tartar Control, Luminous White Charcoal, and our Natural Extracts line all driving incremental growth. Europe delivered double-digit net sales growth in the quarter. Organic sales growth of 4.5% was driven by volume growth across all three segments : oral care, personal care, and home care, and in every hub. Strong oral care volume growth on the Colgate and elmex brands was accompanied by significant brand building investment in traditional media and digital. We were also encouraged by a return to organic growth for Filorga where strong China growth more than offset weakness in the travel retail channel. We delivered 7% net sales and 5% organic sales growth in Asia-Pacific led by volume growth across our biggest hubs : Greater China, India, the Philippines, and South Pacific. In India and China, our growth strategies are driving improved toothpaste performance through Colgate Miracle Repair in China, Colgate Vedshakti in India, and our re-launched Colgate anti-cavity business across the division. Our personal care and home care businesses also benefited from COVID-related demand in the South Pacific region. Africa Eurasia net sales declined 1.5% due to significant foreign exchange headwinds as the division delivered organic sales growth across all three categories and in every hub. Toothpaste organic sales growth was led by Colgate Herbal, Colgate Max Fresh, and Colgate Total. Meridol also delivered strong growth as we look to gain share in the pharmacy channel. Hill\u2019s finished the year with another quarter of strong net sales and organic sales growth despite continued difficult comparisons. Organic sales growth was again led by the U.S. with ecommerce up significantly, but Europe also delivered double-digit growth. Encouragingly, we are seeing a re-acceleration in our prescription diet business as vet channel traffic continues to improve. Now for guidance. We expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long term target range. Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low single-digit benefit for the year, although we expect currencies to remain volatile. We expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%. We expect our gross profit margin to be up year-over-year in 2021 despite difficult comparisons given our performance in 2020, increases in raw materials, and the continuing uncertainty associated with COVID. Advertising is also expected to be up on a percent of sales basis, although less so than in 2020. Our tax rate is expected to be between 23.5% to 24.5% on both a GAAP and base business basis. We point out that our guidance range does not account for any changes in U.S. corporate tax rates given the recent change in administration.  On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share growth in the low to mid single digits. On a base business basis, we expect earnings per share growth in the mid to high single digits. Obviously this is a wider range than what we normally provide, which we think is prudent given what we consider to be a heightened level of uncertainty as we plan out the year. There are several factors that could impact where we fall within this wider range. First, COVID-related consumption. In the categories where consumption has risen during the pandemic, primarily liquid hand soap, dish soap and cleaners, we are expecting lower rates of growth or even declines year-over-year in 2021, depending on the market. However, we expect overall consumption in these categories to remain elevated versus 2019 levels. Also, particularly in emerging markets, movements in foreign exchange could impact our ability to take pricing. We are optimistic about our pricing plans for 2021 and believe they are appropriate given recent raw material trends, the competitive environment, and foreign exchange. Raw materials - we have budgeted for increased raw material costs, but we do highlight that many raw material prices are accelerating faster than anticipated. If this continues, it could pressure on gross margin expansion depending on our ability to take pricing or drive additional productivity. Finally, logistics - we have seen a further rise in logistics costs over the past few quarters, particularly in the U.S. but also relate to shipping containers in Asia. We expect these costs to remain elevated in the near term but to moderate later in the year. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Noel. Noel Wallace : Thanks John, and good morning everyone. Like me, I hope you and your families are safe and healthy, and you share some sense of optimism that we can return to a more normal existence over the course of this year. I want to welcome Stan Sutulla to the first Colgate-Palmolive earnings call. Stan joined us back in November, as we announced, and obviously we\u2019re deeply excited to have him here. He\u2019s hit the ground running already. As I reflected on 2020, I\u2019m so proud of the Colgate people around the world and what they\u2019ve accomplished. Our first quarter call, I discussed three topics related to how we planned to manage through the crisis. These three topics were staying true to our values and purpose and helping us navigate a very difficult environment, adapting our strategies where necessary and executing with agility, and importantly managing through the crisis with an eye towards the future.  On the first topic, we\u2019ve implemented programs to keep our employees safe and healthy while keeping our supply chain and our laboratories up and running and delivering record output from our facilities and our R&D organization. Nothing is more important than the safety and health of Colgate people and we will continue in 2021 to keep them as our first priority. We worked with the World Health Organization this year in local hospitals to distribute free health and hygiene products to people all over the world to help stop the spread of COVID and enable people to live healthier lives, programs that Colgate people are deeply proud of.  In the second area, we continued to execute on our growth mindset strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth through more impactful premium innovation, which you\u2019ll hear more about at CAGNY, increasing our brand building globally, and executing against our digital transformation. As John laid out, we did this all while delivering strong and balanced growth in organic net sales, net sales, operating profit, earnings per share, and free cash flow. We were able to achieve those results despite many operating challenges we confronted and a sizeable negative impact from foreign exchange. Most importantly, while we\u2019ve been delivering on 2020 results, we have been very focused on positioning ourselves for growth in 2021 and beyond by taking advantage of our momentum, and that was the third topic - managing through this crisis with an eye towards the future. Now I\u2019ll provide some thoughts on why I believe what we did last year leaves us well positioned to continue our growth journey in 2021 and beyond. There are three reasons. The first is that as an organization, we have truly changed how we think about growth. As a company with leading brands, we have to be focused on driving category growth, and we can drive this growth in many ways. Of course, we can increase the number of people buying our products, we can increase the price that people are willing to pay for our products, and we can increase the frequency of how often people use our products. We have strengthened existing tools and, importantly, built new capabilities to drive this growth. For example, on Hill\u2019s we\u2019re reaching a much larger group of consumers through increased advertising to broaden our reach and improving our digital targeting so we can raise brand awareness and household penetration in what is truly a differentiated brand. Think about this as finding the right person with the right message at the right time. It\u2019s not just spending more, but spending smarter. In Latin America, we have used revenue growth management tools to drive value with price mix improvement in a very difficult operating environment. For instance, our share of the premium segment in toothpaste in Brazil has expanded by three points in the last two years, all driven by tactical and strategic revenue growth management.  As I discussed at the Barclays conference, we have disrupted our innovation processes to focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation which will enable us to increase the frequency of how people use our products and purchase our products. Pure performance, new forms, delivery systems and innovation for new channels all allow us to expand our availability to the consumer so they can choose our products more frequently, and given that Colgate brand has the highest household penetration of any consumer brand in the world, we have a unique ability to leverage our presence into faster growth. The second reason is that we\u2019re developing a balanced view of how we deliver profitable growth. We know that in order to deliver a TSR that is in the top tier of our peer group, we can\u2019t just grow the top line, we need to deliver profitable growth. You can see this in our 2020 results where we delivered 8% earnings per share growth despite negative foreign exchange, while increasing brand building and investing in capabilities across the entire organization. We\u2019re doing this by pulling on all the levers : premium innovation, revenue growth management, funding the growth, discipline on overheads, and laser focused on all cost elements throughout the income statement.  Looking forward, we have to do more than offset the expected increases in raw material costs and logistics and in other areas, so that we can continue to invest in the transformational capabilities that we\u2019re deploying and that will rely on pairing growth and productivity more effectively.  The third reason is that we\u2019re making the necessary transformation to our culture to unleash the true potential of Colgate people. As anyone who has come here from the outside can tell you, the desire of Colgate people to win is unmatched. In 2020, we took several steps to accelerate the rate of change to build an organization for future growth. To that end, we made real progress on ecommerce, where we have brought in more external talent while up-skilling existing talent across the enterprise, launched more online-specific innovation like the Optic White Pen and the Miracle Repair Serum, and invested broadly behind enhanced digital capabilities. All of this paid off in more than 50% online growth in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ll exit the year with ecommerce at a double-digit run rate as a percentage of total sales. Lastly, it\u2019s building out the right team. You need to provide the right tools to them, the right technology to digitally transform the organization. We continue to invest in systems to enable this transformation, like our transition SAP S/4HANA that\u2019s giving us better system speed, far better reporting, streamlined processes, and simplified transactions. We\u2019ve developed our cloud capabilities, which is giving us far more agility, speed and capability building, our ability now to develop applications much faster and realize the value of those applications much faster, and with our partners building support for our data and our analytics journey ahead. We also recently rolled out a new global system with our Colgate business planning process - you will remember that was called CBP, that will significantly reduce the process time required by providing greater opportunity for our teams to do analytics, particularly in the commercial area and particularly around revenue growth management. To sum it up, I look back at 2020 as a year where our company battled through uncertainty to deliver really strong results. I would also look back at a year where we elevated our performance and capabilities and positioned ourselves to deliver sustainable, profitable growth into the future. With that, I\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey guys. You\u2019ve been able to realize some pretty significant pricing in the last few quarters of 2020. You mentioned optimism on pricing for 2021, also mentioned the rising raw material environment, clearly. Just wanted to understand the balance between pricing and volume in your 3% to 5% organic sales outlook, how much pricing you\u2019re assuming, and perhaps you can touch on your ability to take further pricing in emerging markets in a weaker dollar environment and given the state of the consumer, and then in the U.S. the promotional environment also relative to 2020. The gist of the question is, look, it\u2019s a robust organic sales growth outlook relative to last year, so just trying to understand what gives you confidence versus a tough comparison and how pricing plays into that. Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes, thanks Dara. Let me come back again, I guess overarching in terms of strategy for us, because it plays into obviously our ability to deliver sustained profitable growth, which is a balance between volume and price. Obviously you can look at the details with volume and price across all divisions and categories - it certainly suggests that the underlying momentum and strategy seem to be working, but let me come back and reiterate some of the focus areas that have built that momentum this year. Obviously the re-focus and orientation around premium innovation, just aside from recovering some of the transactional elements that moved through foreign exchange, we\u2019ve been very focused on getting premium innovation in the market, we\u2019ve been very focused on delivering revenue growth management and discipline and teaching our commercial teams to execute that differently. We\u2019ve addressed adjacencies in certain markets which tend to give us more margin and value in the categories as well. We\u2019ve talked about our core strategy, which likewise in some of our big businesses around the world, great superior technology going into the market, allowing us to take more value as we move up, and obviously the discipline that we\u2019ve historically had around just taking pricing to recover foreign exchange transaction, and you\u2019ve seen that particularly in the back half of this year, so we\u2019ll have good flow-through of that as we see an environment that you talked about with increasing raw material prices, particularly over the last couple months. So again, it\u2019s our ability to deliver balanced growth, getting the pricing where we need to, but making sure that the innovation is there to continue to drive both volume and price. We see it both in emerging as well as developed markets across the board. Relative to your question on the promotional environment, certainly we\u2019ve seen a slightly more benign promotional environment through the year. Obviously we had some low points, but if you take the back half just as an example in toothpaste, we\u2019re looking now running--the category is running at about 28% of sales on promotion. Pre-COVID, it was running 31, 32, so it\u2019s back to where it was previously, and my sense is there\u2019s discipline in the market. We\u2019ll see what happens post-COVID as consumers move back into stores and foot traffic increases and retailers decide to dial up the promotion piece, but right now it\u2019s more disciplined and we\u2019ll continue to manage that going forward.  But again, I think it comes back to the core strategies of innovation, how we\u2019re thinking about premium, core and adjacencies, and then the other piece of this is a lot of good work around revenue growth management across the world that\u2019s allowing us to get better balance and better quality pricing in the marketplace. Operator : Thank you, and we\u2019ll take our next question from Andrea Teixeira of JP Morgan. Andrea, please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Yes, sorry. Sorry, just making sure--yes, hello. I apologize for the problem. My question is on shipments, I guess consumption. If you look at the fourth quarter and how it flows through in the first and perhaps the second quarter, I understand what some of the--when we look at Nielsen, especially in the U.S., we can\u2019t basically see how shipment against consumption is in cat food and all the other categories, so as we look into 2021, how we should be thinking as you see your outlook for volumes. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Two aspects there. I think behind the question is where are inventories relative to the trade and consumers. Certainly following the pantry load that we saw in the first quarter, we saw those inventories come out in subsequent quarters - second, third and in the fourth, and trade inventories obviously, I think, were well in line. A little discontinuity in the fourth quarter and into January, I think as retailers came out of the Christmas season. They overloaded in some commodity categories and they\u2019re looking to balance it across the board, but by and large we\u2019re where we wanted to be. The replenishment of some of the high demand categories is basically there, and we think we\u2019re in a good place relative to where we stand. We still have some opportunities in categories like liquid hand soap and dish, given the heightened demand, but overall inventories are not in a place that has any concern to us. I think what\u2019s interesting, another point behind your question is obviously that our consumption or our shipments are running ahead of some of the market share trends we see around the world, and that again comes back to the point that we\u2019ve talked about before, that our focus has been in driving top line organic growth, getting to where consumers are shopping, and the high growth that we\u2019ve seen obviously in ecommerce and other channels that are non-tracked is obviously in our shipment numbers and not necessarily reflected in the consumption numbers, given that the non-tracked are growing at a significant multiple to the tracked channels today. By and large, I think the strategies of continuing to drive balanced top line growth across the growing channels is certainly delivering the acceleration that you\u2019ve seen in the back half of this year, which has obviously been underpinned by strong advertising support and brand building. Operator : Thank you, and we\u2019ll take our next question from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yes, good morning everyone. Noel, I wanted to ask you a question about self diagnostics and self care - I mean, these are increasing trends especially as the population ages, COVID has put kind of a highlight on that. I just wanted to get a sense how--you know, given Colgate\u2019s credentials in science, strong brand name, is this an area that you think you can explore and create a new pillar of growth? Then just piggybacking off of that, how would you do that? Would it be through M&A or could you do it through organic means? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes, interesting question, Nik. Strategically when you start looking at some of the behavior changes that we\u2019ve seen in categories like oral health and skin health, let me start with oral health where we obviously have a very strong relationship with the professional community and understanding how they\u2019ve begun to embrace telehealth. What\u2019s interesting is go back two years and telehealth was very much non-existent, and obviously COVID has accelerated trends necessary, and the ability to look at monitoring systems and how those relationships between the dental practitioners and consumers are elevated is a space that we think very, very interesting.  Let\u2019s take the new product that we\u2019ve launched online this year, the Hum electric toothbrush which give you diagnostics live through a consumer app on exactly how you\u2019re brushing your teeth and areas of improvement. We see that as an ongoing trend relative to connecting and building education at home, and you can start to piece it together long term how you then connect that with the profession in terms of a fully integrated end-to-end process. Likewise in skin health, the same thing - we\u2019re starting to see obviously telehealth expand there. We\u2019re seeing do-it-yourself procedures being done more at home. The consumers are much more open to taking part in things like skin peel, as an example, where we\u2019ve launched a new entry level skin peel for PCA that allows us to do more do it at home versus having to come to the derm office. Obviously for the more sophisticated procedures, we continue to partner with consumers to get them into the profession to do that. There\u2019s certainly a trend there. We\u2019ve got people working on that and then opportunity to continue to elevate our partnerships and obviously bring new growth opportunities to the business as we think about connecting both the profession with the consumer with integrated devices. Operator : Thank you, and our next question will come from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Great, thank you. Good morning. Wanted to just get a little bit more detail into the key puts and takes to get to the 3% to 5% organic sales target, obviously volume versus pricing contribution to the top line given that promotion should continue to normalize, and obviously FX turning to a contribution, and then just a little bit of a view in terms of growth rate by product segment, oral care versus personal care and home care and Hill\u2019s. Just trying to get a better sense of your level of visibility and where the flex points might be, given how much the current environment is evolving. Then as you think about what spending is already in the base, particularly for SG&A, versus what you\u2019re planning for 2021, where do you think the areas are for potential upside and downside? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure, let\u2019s talk a little bit more on the categories. Obviously the uncertainty we have in the categories is exactly when you\u2019ll see categories normalize relative to some of the accelerated consumption you\u2019ve seen, particularly in COVID-related categories like liquid hand soap, like dish liquid. Our assumptions and plans as we built the 2021 budget were that we would see those begin to normalize in the back half of 2021, albeit at a lower level than we saw growth rates versus 2020 but slightly above the \u201919 levels, so we still expect that we\u2019ll see some opportunities for growth in the first half and then normalizing more in the back half versus \u201919. But again, it depends very much, Olivia, on where you are in the world. As you probably well know, the COVID growth in consumption has been very much driven by the developed markets, particularly North America, to a certain extent some markets in Europe which had some pantry loading in the first quarter, and Australia. You have not seen that in emerging markets; in fact, if you take Africa, to a certain extent Asia, the Middle East, you\u2019ve seen categories, quite frankly, languish and not nearly as robust as you\u2019ve seen in emerging markets, which I think makes our emerging market growth particularly pleasing given the balance that we\u2019ve seen, both in price and volume, across our big emerging markets and the growth that\u2019s come behind that, which has been terrific. Again, balanced growth through the first half of the year, we\u2019ll see things normalize, and that\u2019s built into the current consensus as John laid out.  In terms of advertising, again strategic for us this year. We\u2019ve talked about from the first quarter on that we were going to invest behind the brands. The increased momentum that we\u2019ve seen in the business has allowed us to broaden our spending across more categories, but particularly focused on where we\u2019re seeing significant growth in the categories. Let\u2019s take the Hill\u2019s business, which constituted a big percentage of the advertising increase on the year and in the fourth quarter, and you\u2019ve obviously seen the continued very strong performance on that business. That\u2019s a business with more or less 10% awareness and low brand penetration, so the runway ahead of that business, we believe continues to be very strong and we will continue to obviously put the investment where we\u2019re getting the return on that. Likewise in the North America business, we obviously put more money into some of the premium innovations that we\u2019ve launched in the back half - the whitening pen, the super premium Optic White Renewal toothpaste, some of the work that we\u2019re doing online and being much more targeted in that space. So again, the advertising has been very focused, broad in the sense of allowing us to go after certain categories around the world that we had not been supporting, where we saw some good opportunities, particularly in adjacencies, so we\u2019re quite pleased with our ability strategically to get more investment behind the brands given the health of the P&L. Operator : Our next question will come from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great, thanks. Morning everyone, and congratulations on the strong results this year. Noel, I wanted to spend some time on your emerging markets business, just specifically around category growth and market share momentum, and then tie that into your outlook for the year. Obviously really strong performance, and that\u2019s been part of the story here, driving the solid results in the back half of the year. Pricing has remained a strong contributor - one kind of understands that with respect to inflation and FX headwinds that the company has been coping with, but I think what\u2019s noteworthy is that volume has been quite resilient in the back half of the year in a way that it wasn\u2019t, even despite the fact you\u2019re lapping tougher year-over-year comparisons. I was hoping you\u2019d spend a moment, is this sort of the rising tide is raising all boats? Have you observed an acceleration in your categories, perhaps owing to increased consumer mobility related to the pandemic, or are you seeing very tangible signs of encouraging market share momentum owing to some of the strategic shifts in spending and investment that you discussed earlier in the call? If you could just tie that in also at a high level, what is the company embedding in its 2021 outlook related to emerging markets. Thank you for all that. Noel Wallace : Sure, a lot packed in that question. Let me get to emerging categories. What\u2019s particularly pleasing on our performance this year is that, as I mentioned to Olivia, we\u2019ve seen a slowdown in some of the categories in emerging markets this year relative to the comparison on developed, and a lot of the good volume growth we\u2019ve driven in those markets again comes back to the strategy - more premium innovation where we were under-indexed. You heard me mention Brazil, where we\u2019ve increased three points in super premium toothpaste, ASPs are up about 12%, and all quality growth in the Brazilian market. Now, we\u2019ve given up a little bit of share at the low end of the price points where we\u2019ve seen some of our competitors driving a lot of volume at low price points, but the quality of our share and the profitability of our share in that market is far better than it was, given the focus on premium innovation. The other point that\u2019s driving good volume growth in emerging markets again is our core. Focusing on core in Asia, a big part of our toothpaste in those markets, where we\u2019ve seen obviously sluggish market growth, are shipments ahead of consumption, which is, I think, a tracked channel issue, again driven by good core innovation - taking pricing, bringing superior value to the consumer, and leveraging some big parts of our business across a couple markets. The third would be the adjacency strategy that we\u2019ve had in emerging markets, whether that\u2019s in Africa, whether that\u2019s in Latin America, looking at adjacencies that we can get good margin accretion in, that have high growth rates. Skin and facial products in Latin America, as an example, behind our Protex brand have performed very, very well, particularly in markets like Brazil. So again, the strategies that we\u2019ve been deploying across innovation, particularly core premium and adjacencies, have played out. The other piece of this is depending on where you are, the emerging growth of ecommerce has been quite important for us, both in developing markets as well as the developed markets. If you take the growth that we\u2019ve seen in emerging, ecommerce is still a low percentage of the total ACV in Latin America and in Africa. Obviously in Asia, the inverse - it\u2019s significant growth in the category right now, and we\u2019ve had terrific performance across our Asian business, particularly in China behind some of the unique innovation that we\u2019ve put in the market.  We\u2019ll see how ecommerce continues to perform as foot traffic increases, but if you take the China piece specifically where we\u2019ve been very focused on driving our online and digital capabilities, we\u2019ve seen our market shares in ecommerce grow nicely in 2020 based on the strategy that we\u2019ve been deploying. Overall, I think we\u2019ve been looking at the channel growth in the right way, we\u2019ve been looking at the portfolio strategies from an innovation standpoint in the right way. Now as COVID gets behind us, you would hope that we\u2019d start to see a re-acceleration of the categories in emerging markets in the back half of 2021, and obviously they\u2019ve been a little bit sluggish given, I think, some of the issues with the mobility in those markets and the significant increase in the virus, particularly in markets like Latin America and in certain markets of Africa. The belief is that in the back half, we\u2019ll see that start to stabilize and we\u2019ll see markets return, which will give us obviously an increased opportunity to continue to drive volume. Operator : Our next question will come from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. My question actually had to do with India, because I saw the numbers that came out of that division yesterday, and it\u2019s obviously the exception that we actually get to see numbers for a specific country for you. I know it\u2019s small, but the thing that struck me was top line growth was good but not great, but margin expansion was huge, off the charts, and gross margin, I think in India is now north of 70%. I just wanted to ask about it in the context, Noel, of your focus on balanced growth.  Again, India is a small market, but when I think about some of your other big emerging market businesses that should be faster growers over the long term, I think, to help you meet your long-term growth algorithm, at what point do you say, wow, a 70% gross margin in an emerging market business is too high? Are there other countries where margins have really been exploding like that? It just struck me as kind of a surprise in the numbers, and I wondered if there was something more to it in terms of how you think about balancing top line versus bottom line growth over the longer term. Noel Wallace : Yes, thanks Wendy. Listen, India is a very important market for us. We were very pleased with the rebound in the growth that we saw in the back half of 2020. Given some of the COVID issues experienced in the first quarter leading to lockdowns at the back end of that quarter and into the second quarter, generating a 7% organic in the third and just shy of 10% organic in the fourth, we think is just a terrific performance. Again, coming back to the strategy, India is very focused, likewise given the strong oral care business we have, on premiumizing that marketplace, and we\u2019ve launched premium SKUs in Vedshakti, which is our new naturals position. We\u2019ve continued to improve on the learning we\u2019re seeing coming out of the naturals segment, which is an important growth opportunity for us. We\u2019ve launched new adjacencies, new pulling oil mouth sprays in the market with anti-bacterial benefits, which have been terrific, so we\u2019re looking at ways to continue to premiumize that business and move pricing up at the same time, which you\u2019ve seen. I talked about it just earlier, the core renovations that we\u2019ve had. A big part of the India business is their core anti-cavity business, and we\u2019ve had a significant re-launch underway for the better part of a year now on the core anti-cavity business, which allowed us to get pricing up as well as drive significant superiority into that product in terms of a consumer benefit. The third would be the revenue growth management aspects that we\u2019re starting to deploy with a lot more discipline and learning, and we\u2019ve got more work to do certainly in emerging markets but we\u2019ve seen great response from the teams getting behind opportunities to look at our promotional spend, specifically price-side architecture and looking for opportunities to drive more margin into the business.  Overall, I think that the focus there is good top line growth - you\u2019ve seen it in the organic, and strategically we think we\u2019ve got some opportunities to continue to accelerate there. The comparisons get a little bit easier in the first half. We\u2019ll obviously have difficult comps more in the back half given what I just stated, but we think the strategy is working and the investment that we\u2019re putting into that market, as you saw from the release yesterday, is delivering. Operator : Thank you, and our next question will come from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Carey : Hi, good morning. I think you mentioned that toothpaste is running maybe 300, 400 basis points below historicals from a promotional standpoint. You\u2019re probably seeing even lower promotional levels in home care categories. I guess--and maybe I\u2019m reading too much into it, but it sounded to me like you think that these lower promo levels can potentially hold going into 2021 and maybe even beyond. Maybe for 2021 but also just higher level, did you learn something in 2020 about how much promotion is actually needed to drive growth in your categories, and do you think that these lower levels of promotion can potentially sustain longer term? Noel Wallace : Yes, thank you. Again, based on how retailers are looking and how we\u2019re partnering with retailers to grow category growth, we\u2019re looking to optimize category by value, and we\u2019ve had a lot more time to spend analyzing how promotion effectiveness is delivering that. Certainly as foot traffic has come down, some of the retailers haven\u2019t pushed more aggressive promotions, but as I mentioned, the promotional levels are slightly below where they were historically - three points, and my sense is post-COVID, you might see those return to normalization, back to the levels that we had historically, but that will be determined. This is an emerging market issue more than anything and the developing--excuse me, developed market issue. In the developing part of the world or in emerging markets, we haven\u2019t seen substantive changes there relative to what we\u2019ve seen historically, so I think what retailers and manufacturers are looking for, how do we continue to drive growth in the categories, everyone is recognizing that innovation is the catalyst to do that, and obviously as things have normalized more around COVID and the demand issues in some of those categories, they\u2019re looking to get back to strategic growth opportunities longer term, and that\u2019s where the innovation comes into play and we\u2019ll continue to bring that to them. So we\u2019re being disciplined on it, the revenue growth management is having some impact on that, obviously, where we\u2019re starting to pull away from promotions that don\u2019t deliver quality into the category and deliver quality into the P&L for us and our retailers, and you\u2019ve seen some of that obviously in that number that I mentioned. But by and large, we\u2019ll probably see things normalize in the back of the year. We\u2019ve planned for that, but again our focus right now is on bringing real value to the categories through premium innovation and re-launching our core businesses in certain parts of the world, which drives real value to the category. Operator : Thank you, and our next question will come from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good morning folks, and welcome Stan. Thank you for sliding me in. At the risk of being chastised by Mr. Faucher later today, I\u2019m going to try to sneak in two quick questions, one tactical and one bigger picture. First on tactical, you mentioned December retail load, you mentioned your comps [indiscernible] quarter pantry stocking, expectation of a bit more of a back half-weighted EM growth story. Should we be braced for a more sluggish start to the year? That\u2019s the tactical question. And bigger picture, ecomm growth, you talked about it a few times. Can you quantify what it is as a percentage of your sales today, how it compares to where you were before, and how, if at all, you\u2019re re-imagining your marketing and media approach in the wake of the shift? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. I think the tactical question, where do we see categories evolving first half versus second half 2021, I think you\u2019re going to see--obviously we saw some of the sluggishness in December in the categories. You\u2019ve heard that from others who have announced, and that\u2019s quite frankly not unexpected. I mean, I think when you see the ongoing way of unemployment, the delays in stimulus, but more importantly moving into the holiday season--and again I\u2019m talking U.S. here, moving into the holiday season, people obviously prioritizing their consumption against other necessities at that time. January, the categories have started to come back slightly, so we\u2019re not terribly concerned. The behavior changes that we\u2019ve seen in the categories, whether it\u2019s liquid hand soap, dish liquid or cleaners, I think are there to stay for while, Jason. We\u2019ll see those, at least from a liquid hand soap standpoint, stay there for the medium and long term. Obviously as people move back into offices and move away from home, you\u2019ll see the impact on dish liquids and APCs, but remember those three categories aren\u2019t a significant percentage of our overall sales. We\u2019ll see the categories, I think, sustain at higher levels in 2019, probably slightly lower than \u201920 as we stated in the first half, and then normalize in the back half. Coming to ecommerce, again a very deliberate focus for us. As I mentioned in my comments, one, bringing in talent from outside, training and developing our commercial organization to understand how to execute a lot more flawlessly in ecommerce, and it requires a lot more effort to do that. The sophistication of dealing effectively in ecommerce is very different, and as you look at the sophistication that we brought to the indirect trade over the last 15 to 20 years, it\u2019s that same level of focus that we\u2019re bringing to the online world now, both from a digital standpoint and from an ecommerce standpoint. The growth was over 50% in the fourth quarter. Obviously as John mentioned, we exited the year with ecommerce at double-digit percentage of our total sales in the company, and you\u2019ve seen strategically in the key markets where we have focused and where ecommerce has become more prevalent, i.e. China, the U.S. and Hill\u2019s, you\u2019ve seen us obviously driving share, getting the right innovation into that channel, understanding the analytics and learning from that, and building on that momentum. We see that as a continued growth opportunity, but we\u2019re going to be where consumers are shopping and we\u2019ll see those shifts as we go throughout the year, but the important part for us is that our share is still slightly below our general market share in ecommerce where we get share, which is in not very many places, so we\u2019d know direction and we still have more upside growth to be had there. Operator : Our next question will come from Bill Chappell with Truist Securities. Bill Chappell : Thanks, good morning. If you look back at 2020, just trying to understand, especially for the pet business or for Hill\u2019s, as well as the total business, what type of comparison do you think in terms of--it seems like on the oral care any stockpiling that was done in March and April was kind of de-loaded in the later months, and so on a full-year basis the comps aren\u2019t really that different. Is that fair? Then on pet, I don\u2019t have a good idea just because vet centers were closed, so didn\u2019t know if you felt like the business ran at full capacity throughout the year, at 85% capacity. Just trying to understand as we\u2019re looking at the growth for 2021, what comps you really see. Noel Wallace : Sure, let me take the toothpaste one first. As I mentioned, broadly the categories were sluggish in the first half, started to come back a little bit in the back half of the year, and as we accelerated our innovation pace and our advertising, we saw obviously our shipments accelerate in the back half on oral care, particularly in toothpaste. As we look to comp that next year, we\u2019ll see how the behavior transpires in the first half of this year. The key is we\u2019ve got strong innovation, as I mentioned, both coming out of 2020 as well as a first half innovation pipeline, that we think is good, so we\u2019ll see what happens. But again, the message here is understanding the behavior shifts is obviously extraordinarily difficult and very different from market to market around the world. Obviously the U.S. being an important part of our toothpaste business, we\u2019ve seen sluggishness there. Strong pipeline, as you talked about pantry in Q1, but we saw that come out and we\u2019re starting to see a more balanced approach and more normal approach in terms of consumption moving forward, but our focus is to accelerate that category with the innovation that we\u2019re bringing. Hill\u2019s, obviously the comps were difficult last year. We comped those with strong growth this year, so if I come back to the Hill\u2019s strategy, again it\u2019s about how do we continue to deliver solid category growth for our partners. We\u2019re doing that with obviously the premiumization of the category. We\u2019re bringing great new products into the segment, we were pleased to see the prescription diet business start to come back, which I think is representative of a couple aspects on that business which is, one, we\u2019re seeing people return back to veterinarians and the prescription diet business benefiting from that - our Hill\u2019s to Home initiative has certainly helped that. Obviously the balanced growth we\u2019re seeing across geographies, more so than just the U.S. which has been terrific, a strong performance in Europe this year, again both on the base business as well as prescription diet, so we see that obviously moving forward into 2021. The comps are difficult to be sure, but again remember this is a business with really low brand awareness and low brand penetration, and a great, great product offering, so as we get the balance right in terms of our digital spending focused on those growth opportunities that we see and the innovation that we\u2019re bringing, both in the prescription on the Science Diet side, we see obviously the ability to continue to lap those comparisons that we\u2019ve had this year. The category continues to be strong, between 3% and 5% growth depending on where you are in the world, and obviously the new channels that we\u2019re experiencing growth, specifically ecommerce continue to deliver on that. So again, I think the right level of premiumization, the right channel focus, the right focus on continuing to invest in a business, which you\u2019ll see in 2021, to drive brand awareness and bringing science-based nutrition to the category, which I think is positioned well based on how consumers are behaving. Comps are tough and we realize that, but we think we\u2019ve got good plans in place for 2021. Operator : Thank you, and our next question will come from Kamil Jagrulla [ph] with Credit Suisse. Kamil Jagrulla : Hi guys, good morning. It wasn\u2019t that long ago, I guess, we were talking about local brands in many of these emerging markets taking share, and it sounds like those share losses have abated, but also if maybe you can provide some context on what\u2019s happened competitively in some of those markets today - you know, did they make it through--are they just as a competitive as they were, did they make it through the pandemic? Obviously you just talked about how trends in many of those markets have slowed and a whole set of other complexities where perhaps you were able to survive in a much better position than them. If you can just give some context on what\u2019s happening in some of those major markets, that\u2019d be helpful. Noel Wallace : Sure. Listen - you\u2019ve heard it, I think from others, there has been a return to big brands over the course of COVID, and obviously the importance of health and hygiene and trust played into that resurgence, and ultimately as consumers move back into stores and you get the benefit of displays, you will see perhaps some of the local brands reorient themselves and get some benefit of that. But if you look at the online world, obviously the big players have really figured out how to target more effectively, how to spend in the right mediums, which was historically a space that local brands and some of the insurgent brands were taking, and so over time local brands will always be a threat, but I think as you\u2019ve seen through COVID, a resurgence to big brand trust and reputation, and obviously as we continue to bring a strong innovation pipeline to reward those consumers who have come into the franchise and continue to deliver against their expectations, we feel good about the movements moving forward. But I would say we never want to count local brands out. We continue to keep them very much at the forefront of our strategy and look at them very, very carefully in terms of how they\u2019re orienting themselves locally, based on the insights required to win, and we feel like the innovation structure that we\u2019ve put in place around the world in terms of our focus on H1, H2 and H3 and being more local where required, will hopefully address those increasing challenges that we\u2019ll see as foot traffic increases in the back half. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Thanks. Hey guys, good morning. Noel, I wanted to hear a little bit more around your expected gross margin drivers into \u201921, obviously off a very strong 2020. Can you pull apart those puts and takes that John started talking about at the beginning any further? My real question underneath that is John had laid out a couple of caveats - raw materials, inflation, and others - as potentially pressuring gross profit progression as the year progresses, but it didn\u2019t sound like you expected those would be severe enough to actually turn gross margins negative year-over-year, but more simply just govern the expansion. Is that the right read, or does the lower end of your EPS guidance range actually allow for a scenario where gross margins face some actual contraction if some of those uncertainties break the wrong way? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes, thanks Steve. Again, let me walk through perhaps the margin roll forward on the quarter and the year. Obviously we delivered coming out of the third quarter with a 60.2 margin, we delivered 130 of pricing benefit to the margin funding the growth, which was 280 basis points, and you saw the acceleration in raw materials give us a headwind of 320 on the quarter, but ultimately we were able to deliver 90 gross margin points of growth in the quarter and on the year it was 130, with headwinds of around 230 on the year. I think the important aspect here is good back half pricing that we generated across all of our markets, and that back half will obviously roll through to help compensate some of the increases that we\u2019ll see in 2021. Now that being said, raw materials are running slightly ahead of what we anticipated for the year in 2021, so we need to ensure obviously that we get that pricing to hold, which we will do our best to do. We need to continue to bring premium innovation into the market. We need to continue to focus on the strong funding to growth and the productivity that we have in the P&L to ensure that if raw materials grow even further, we\u2019re able to compensate that in the market. The volatility we\u2019ve seen on raw materials over the years, again it puts us in a place to reorient our focus around getting the innovation in the market, getting the productivity and the revenue growth management initiated, but I think the good story that we have, at least we\u2019re in a position where we took strong back half advertising--excuse me, strong back half pricing in order to help us deliver a flow-through of that into the first half. But again, that\u2019s based on the current rates that we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019ll see how that behaves over the next couple of months. We\u2019re mindful of that, we feel good about our ability to deliver the gross margin expansion, but based on the current input costs that we have and the current spot rates that we\u2019re seeing on foreign exchange. Operator : Our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. Good morning. I was curious about M&A, and actually more specifically the strategy with regard to premium skin, because with your core and organic strategies - you know, investments working presumably so well and building momentum from here with all the advertising support and innovation you\u2019ve got, I was just curious about the role that premium skin will play going forward. I think at the time to me, when you started building that out, it felt a little bit like trying to look for another leg to the stool as things were a bit slower in the core business. I was just wondering how that fits together looking forward, again with the success you\u2019ve having on the core. Noel Wallace : Yes, thanks Lauren. Listen, skin continues to be a really exciting category for us long term. You look at the demographics globally, you look at the economics of that category and you look at where we have made careful choices on where to compete, particularly around professional skin health, so we like the dynamics of the category strategically. Obviously post the acquisitions, we ran into a significant headwind related to COVID, particularly with foot traffic starting in derm offices, foot traffic basically coming to a halt in spas, foot traffic obviously related to travel retail coming to a halt in 2020, so we started to see importantly in the fourth quarter this year, we started to see growth back in those categories, which is terrific. We\u2019ve spent the year, Lauren, and this is a real benefit, I think, to the quality of the performance we had this year, we spent the year investing behind those businesses. We weren\u2019t taking cost out; we were looking to optimize the cost, we were looking to build more capabilities in those businesses, so we had the benefit of spending behind those brands and capabilities to set ourselves up for obviously what we would expect to see a return to growth in those categories, particularly coming out of COVID, likely in the back half. But as John mentioned, we saw some growth of those businesses in the fourth quarter, which was terrific, and we think we\u2019ve set ourselves up relative to seeing those businesses deliver good, sustainable growth for us longer term, and it continues to be a real strategic growth opportunity for us in the long run, hence the reason why we decided to invest in those specific areas that we think give us a unique opportunity to add value to and drive incremental growth in the longer term.  But again, businesses that were severely impacted based on COVID, but again giving us the opportunity to truly understand and build capabilities that we think, long term, those categories will perform quite well. Operator : Thank you, and our next question will come from Robert Ottenstein from Evercore. Robert Ottenstein : Great, thank you very much. I was wondering if you could drill down on the China oral care business. You made a lot of improvements with Darlie and with ecommerce, both with Colgate and Darlie, so maybe an update of where you are with that; and then if I remember right, the challenge was getting Colgate going on the brick and mortar channel, so maybe an update on all those issues. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Again, this was a complete re-look at our strategy in China over the last year. As we alluded to, we expected performance in 2019 to improve in the back half based on those strategies, which it did. We obviously had the significant impact from COVID in the first and second quarters in China, which impacted the business, and we\u2019ve seen the business obviously respond quite well in the back half of this year, in line with the expectations that we have. Our particular focus was around building our go-to-market out differently, specifically with relates to how we want to think about innovation in the online world, which has now become a pretty significant part of that business in China, and pleasingly we have seen shares grow nicely online - again, I think a testament to a reorientation behind premium innovation.  An interesting index for you - pre-COVID or pre-the re-launch strategy in China, our indexes were running around 80% in the online world versus the category, so 20% below the category. Coming out of COVID and into the fourth quarter, our indexes are now running north of 110% to the category on average, so again clear, focused orientation around premiumizing our business, delivering online premium innovation like the Miracle Repair line, like some of the focus that we\u2019ve done in electric toothbrushes have allowed us to really drive the pricing in that category, which has driven incremental value share. Now, the brick and mortar continues to be a bit soft on the Colgate side, quite strong on the Darlie side. Again, the Colgate side is against the significant changes we\u2019ve made in some of our go-to-market that\u2019s taking a little bit more time and obviously impacted by the fact that foot traffic in China was down quite significantly, particularly in hypers and supers as consumers moved online as a result of both behavior change and COVID.  Overall, pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making in China, pleased with the go-to-market changes that are starting to take hold, and encouraged by the early signs of growth momentum in ecommerce and our ability to deliver product innovation digitally in a more effective way. Operator : Thank you, and our final question will come from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Thanks and good morning everybody. I guess I wanted to ask you maybe a bigger picture question to end here. Overall EBIT margin is down a bit in recent years - I think you ended 2020 around where you were in 2012 or so, but sales have obviously accelerated, so how do you think about the give and take here? Can EBIT margin go back to where it was pre-2019, and if so, how do you think about contribution by line item - you know, gross margin, can that expand realistically from here, SG&A? Is ad spend, which is now above where it was a couple of years ago, at the right level, is it too high, too low? If you can just give some bigger picture thoughts there, that\u2019d be helpful, please. Noel Wallace : Sure. First of all, growing operating margin long term starts with obviously delivering sustained top line growth, and that\u2019s been our focus, and revenue is the best creator of operating leverage. Secondly, we have many levers that we use to drive growth, and you\u2019ve heard me talk about quite a few of those today - obviously premiumization efforts, which drive more leverage through the P&L, our revenue growth management efforts which translate right through the P&L as well, you saw the examples I talked about in big markets like Brazil which are certainly bearing fruit, the personal care and home care leverage that we\u2019ve seen obviously in those categories, and as we expect oral care to re-accelerate, it will drive more leverage through the P&L. Obviously funding the growth and productivity is a real focus for us. Great funding the growth in the back half of 2020, a real dialed-up orientation behind some opportunities particularly around our supply chain and looking at our supply chain differently to drive more efficiency of that moving forward, which we think will translate into more leverage.  The real cause of that--of your point there was obviously an acceleration in our spending and increased logistics costs, which impacted a bit on the leverage, and those logistics costs, we hope will subside in the back half. We\u2019re looking at ways to continue to optimize our warehousing and freight services around the world and very focused on finding opportunities to be more efficient there, but the key driver of it is again investing for the long term health of this business and putting advertising into categories and key geographies where we\u2019re seeing real return on growth, as I mentioned particularly Hill\u2019s, the U.S., China, as well as India.  So overall, we\u2019ll see that leverage come through, but our focus right now is delivering operating margin growth through the top line and continuing to accelerate gross margins to allow us to spend behind the business, so overall it\u2019s about growth and we\u2019ll see that leverage come through as we continue to deliver that. Operator : Thank you, and at this time we\u2019ll turn the conference over to Mr. Wallace and presenters for any final or closing remarks. Noel Wallace : Yes, thanks. Again, a strong quarter, pleasing to see obviously the broad-based growth we had on the business, and very pleased around the capability building and how we\u2019re thinking about the business and the changes that we made throughout 2020. Again, to all Colgate people who are really behind this success, thank you for your commitment to our values and our purpose. Thank you for everything that you\u2019ve done. I\u2019m deeply grateful for your commitment to the business and always optimistic that the way we work together, we\u2019re going to continue to build a healthier future for all. Thanks everyone. Stay safe, and we\u2019ll talk to you soon. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John. John Faucher : Thanks, Sarah. Good morning and welcome to our 2021 first quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures. including those identified in table six of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. I will provide commentary on our Q1 performance as well as our latest thoughts on 2021 guidance before turning it over to Noel to discuss our 2021 priorities. We will then open it up for Q&A. As usual, we request that you limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible get to ask a question. If you have further questions, you are welcome to re-enter the queue. We started 2021 in positive fashion with strong organic sales growth despite a very difficult comparison, which included some consumer pantry loading in March of last year. Our net sales grew 6% in the quarter. Organic sales growth of 5% was driven by 0.5% organic volume growth and a 4.5% increase in pricing. Foreign exchange was a 1% tailwind in the quarter. While the tough comparisons, particularly, impacted our trends in developed markets, which were flat on an organic sales basis in the quarter, we delivered double-digit organic sales growth in emerging markets with volume up 5.5% and pricing up 6%. We also delivered organic sales growth in three of our four categories : Oral Care, Home Care and Pet Nutrition, while Personal Care organic sales declined due to difficult comparisons. We believe our strategy to deliver more impactful premium innovation, which Noel and Pat Verduin talked about at CAGNY is bearing fruit and we will continue to focus in this area to drive future growth. Our efforts on premiumization and pricing along with our focus on productivity like our funding the growth initiatives drove improvement year-over-year in our gross margin despite a worsening raw materials environment. This gross margin expansion was a key factor in allowing us to deliver base business earnings per share growth in line with our full year guidance despite higher logistics costs, incremental advertising spending and investment to build capabilities. In the first quarter, our gross profit margin was 60.7% on both a GAAP basis where we were up 50 basis points year-over-year and a base business basis where we were up 40 basis points. For the first quarter, pricing was 170 basis points favorable to gross margin, while raw materials were a 310 basis point headwind. This is a large impact for our first quarter and it was driven by increases in the cost of raw materials like resins, fats and oils, agriculture-related costs and the transactional impact from foreign exchange. Productivity was a 180 basis point benefit. Our SG&A was up 90 basis points as a percent of sales for the first quarter on both a GAAP and base business basis. This was primarily driven by a 50 basis point increase in advertising to sales as we drove strong activation on brand building, innovation and e-commerce. Our SG&A ratio was also impacted by increased logistics costs, primarily, in the US and investments behind innovation. Excluding advertising and logistics, our SG&A ratio declined year-over-year. For the first quarter on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 5.5% year-over-year, while it was up 5% on a base business basis. Our EPS was down 4% on a GAAP basis and up 7% on a base business basis. Our free cash flow was down year-over-year in the quarter against a very difficult comparison. The decline was primarily driven by the negative impact of accounts payable and other liabilities, which was mostly due to changes in the timing of payables and income tax payments. A few comments on our divisional performance. North America net sales were down 0.5% in Q1 with organic sales down 1.5%, a 50 basis point benefit from the Hello acquisition and a 50 basis point benefit from foreign exchange. Our volume declines in the quarter were primarily due to a combination of category deceleration in the face of difficult comparisons as we cycled last year's COVID pantry loading, logistics issues related to a warehouse transition on our US business that impacted our shelf availability and our market shares and the winter storms in February. The logistics issues lessened over the last month of the quarter as service levels improved, and we expect service levels to return to normal by the end of the second quarter. Pricing grew mid-single digits in the quarter, as our efforts in revenue growth management drove pricing growth across all our categories. The combination of higher raw materials costs, higher underlying logistics costs and costs related to remediating the company's specific logistics issues, pressured margins in the North America division. Despite these headwinds, we continue to invest in advertising, particularly behind premium innovation like Colgate Renewal and the Colgate Optic White Overnight Teeth Whitening Pen and behind the continued strength of Colgate Optic White Renewal. Latin America net sales were up 2%, as 9.5% organic sales growth was mostly offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange. We continue to deliver broad-based organic sales growth in Latin America with organic sales growth in all three categories and in every hub. As we highlighted at CAGNY, our innovation in Latin America is driving growth in the premium segment of the toothpaste category. In Brazil, Colgate Total is gaining share behind Colgate Total anti-tartar and our natural extracts line is gaining share particularly behind Charcoal. Our toothpaste value share is flat year-to-date in Brazil in measured channels and is up year-over-year in e-coms. Europe net sales grew 6% in the quarter. Organic sales were down 2%. Volume declined 3.5% in the quarter, as we lapped strong shipments in the year ago period, which was driven by COVID-related demand in pantry loading. Pricing was plus 1.5%, as we took pricing across all categories to help offset raw material inflation. We're launching equity campaigns across our core Oral Care equity, Colgate, meridol, and elmex and we're excited about the launch of Sanex microbiome, which Pat talked about at CAGNY. We delivered 16.5% net sales and 11% organic sales growth in Asia Pacific led by volume growth across our biggest markets, Greater China, India and the Philippines. While China and India benefited from comparisons that included COVID-related shutdowns in 2020, our innovation continues to drive improved underlying performance, particularly in e-commerce. Over the next several quarters we will begin to roll out more premium innovation in brick-and-mortar in China, like our Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste, leveraging the success we have had online in transforming our portfolio. Africa/Euroasia net sales grew 8.5%, as we delivered strong organic sales growth throughout the division. Volume grew 5% in the quarter, while pricing was up 8%. Foreign exchange was a 4.5% headwind. This growth was led by our toothpaste and manual toothbrush businesses, although we also delivered organic sales growth in Personal and Home Care. Our business in Turkey delivered strong sales and market share performance and launched significant premium innovation in naturals, charcoal and white. Phil started the year with another quarter of strong net sales and organic sales growth, despite lapping significant growth in the year ago period. Developed markets led the growth, particularly the US, Canada and Europe, led by e-commerce. Emerging markets grew organic sales greater than 20% in the quarter through a combination of volume and pricing growth. We're very excited about our Hill's equity campaign addressing pet obesity. This global campaign is leveraging digital, in-store, in-office and traditional media assets to drive growth in our weight control products across both our prescription and wellness businesses. And now for guidance. We still expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range. As we think about our current organic growth assumptions versus where we were three months ago, we're probably a little more cautious on developed markets. As you have seen from the scanner data, our categories moved negative more quickly than we had anticipated and we expect that to continue in the short term. Hopefully, this allows for some of the volatility to play itself out sooner in the year and we will see trends stabilize more quickly. Coming into this year in categories where consumption rose last year due to COVID, we expected 2021 consumption levels to be below 2020, but above the levels we saw in 2019. That is the case so far across our developed markets businesses, although year-to-date these categories are slightly weaker than expected. Categories like toothpaste, where usage did not spike in relation to COVID, should normalize more quickly, as we move past some of the aggressive pantry loading in March and April of last year, and we're beginning to see that happen and scale has returned to growth in the last several weeks. We are encouraged by how we started the year in emerging markets. We saw broad-based organic sales growth in our emerging markets across all the divisions and with a good balance of volume and pricing. Comps will get more difficult as we go through the year, but we believe we have solid momentum. Please note that given widespread COVID outbreaks in countries like Brazil, Mexico, and India, we could still see an impact from government actions to stem the spread at COVID and other disruptions related to COVID and this is not in our guidance. Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low-single-digit benefit for the year, although slightly less favorable than when we gave guidance in January. All in, we still expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%. Our gross margin guidance remains unchanged, as we expect our gross profit margin to be up year-over-year in 2021, on both the GAAP and base business basis. As we mentioned on our 2020 year-end call, raw materials began the year moving higher and faster than we had expected. This trajectory has continued through the first quarter as you all know. We are still laser-focused on driving our gross margin higher, but the significant increase in costs across our materials base obviously requires additional pricing and productivity. Advertising is still expected to be up on both a dollar and a percent of sales basis. Logistics also continues to be a headwind, particularly in the US, where costs also have risen faster than anticipated. We expect these costs to remain elevated in the near term but to moderate later in the year. Our tax rate is expected to be between 23.5% and 24.5%. We point out that our guidance does not account for any changes in US corporate tax rates, given the recent change in administration. On a GAAP basis we still expect earnings per share growth in the low to mid-single-digits. On a base business basis, we continue to expect earnings per share growth in the mid-to high-single-digits. The adverse moves in foreign exchange and raw materials have moved us slightly lower in that range over the past few months, but it is still early in the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Noel. Noel Wallace : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll keep my commentary brief since we've -- so we have plenty of time for the Q&A. I think the results for the quarter really speak for themselves. Obviously we're really pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Despite the significant volatility in headwinds, we delivered strong results around the world and up and down our P&L. While we've made progress in our strategic areas we've been discussing, we still have a lot to do in the balance of the year. Here are our key priorities for the remainder of 2021 : Continue to drive broad-based growth. Our priorities here are the same as we've discussed for the past several years. We need to grow volume and pricing. We need organic sales growth in every category and in every division in both emerging and developed markets. In order to do this, we'll continue to ramp up our breakthrough and transformational premium innovation. We delivered high-single-digit growth in toothpaste in the first quarter, despite lapping solid growth in the year-ago period, which helped us drive high-single-digit growth in our Oral Care business. We're driving growth through innovation like Colgate Renewal in the US, Colgate Enzyme Whitening toothpaste in China and our natural extracts line and Colgate Total Anti-Tartar Line in Latin America. As Pat and I discussed at CAGNY, this is a marathon not a sprint, but we're making good progress, which will continue as we shift our resources, continue to build new skills and even adapt how we motivate our teams. Pricing is also an important element of growth. And behind our revenue growth management efforts, we continue to drive strong pricing as we look to increase our price index versus the market as well as offsetting rising costs. You're hearing about rising costs from every company this quarter and we're seeing inflation on pretty much every line of the P&L, but especially raw materials, warehousing and logistics. Naturally our pricing plans are focused. We just discussed, we're battling the cost inflation across the board. We are also driving savings through funding the growth and other efficiency initiatives, which helped to offset these headwinds an effort, Stan, our new CFO, is spearheading for us. We do not expect these headwinds to abate anytime soon, so we have to continue to invest in marketing and building capabilities for future growth while delivering on our earnings guidance. We know we need to be disciplined and efficient in this area. The third is maintaining our focus on building out the key pillars of our long-term strategy while simultaneously managing through all of the volatility. That includes building our capabilities on innovation, e-commerce, digital and data and analytics, progressing on ESG, including increasing our commitments on DE&I and advancing our 2025 sustainability targets, and then ultimately navigating to return to work for most of our office-based employees. We are building a team and a culture at Colgate that is focused on adapting and changing to this volatile world. We're embracing new strategies and new ways of working and it's paying off. We've had a good start to 2021 and we're looking to maintain our momentum through the rest of the year. So with that, why don't we open it up to questions? Operator : All right. Thank you so much. Today\u2019s question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically for the telephone audience. [Operator Instructions] Okay. We will take the first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning guys. Noel Wallace : Hi, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So can you give us an update on category growth rates in some of your key emerging markets as we cycle COVID? Obviously, there's a lot of volatility short-term but I'm thinking more looking out longer-term, just an update here on volume growth and per capita consumption development opportunity going forward as well as any thoughts on pricing mix and trade-up potential? Has anything changed here longer-term more structurally as we think about the consumer? And what are your strategy adjustments? And, obviously, it won't be a monolithic answer. So maybe you can compare and contrast some of the different emerging markets? And how that might be different? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks Dara. If you go back, obviously, it depends on the geography. And what we've talked about consistently I think is the volatility that we're seeing all over the world and highly dependent on how countries have treated and dealt with COVID and the rate of incidents in those countries. Obviously if you start with Asia, the categories are coming back, although still not back to where we were pre-COVID due to some of the store closures that we continue to see across Asia, particularly China and Southeast Asia coming back in terms of a category development standpoint. And that's based on the fact that particularly in China, you see the COVID issues being put to rest and consumers returning to some level of normality. Thailand continues to be a challenge. You've heard I think consistently from others that that market highly dependent on tourism, so it's impacted that category. India, we won't talk a lot about India as we haven't announced yet, but suffice it to say that they had easy comps from last year from a category standpoint but you're starting to see those numbers come back quite nicely. Moving on to Latin America. Again surprisingly, we've seen a very resilient Latin America particularly our business there. In terms of where we see the categories playing out, toothpaste is starting to come back although it started off quite slowly but we've seen particularly in the recent readings, the category returning to growth, which is good. Africa continues I think to perform okay. I think Africa is a real uncertain environment right now relative to the rate of vaccinations in that geography. So that will have an impact. But if you take that holistically across emerging markets, I think the important area here is that, obviously, those markets were from a GDP standpoint severely impacted in 2020. As you see oil prices come back those tend to benefit emerging markets and that will play out in higher GDP, some inflation, obviously, allows us to continue to take pricing in those markets. And I think as you see the rate of vaccinations increase, those markets are likely to come back quite nicely particularly in the back half of this year. From a pricing standpoint, consistently across all emerging markets, we've been able to take strong pricing given the strength of our businesses and that really started back in 2020. And you've seen a competitive environment is, obviously, having to offset a lot of the raw material inflation that we've seen taking pricing, which has allowed the emerging markets to take a little bit more value in their categories. And clearly there from a per cap standpoint, we continue to be investing in our per capita programs particularly across Africa, parts of Asia and Latin America and that is consistent and I think that margin growth that we've had has allowed us to continue to invest in areas like per cap, which we think obviously bode well for the long-term. Operator : And we will take the next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was curious if\u2026 Stan Sutula : Hi Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : \u2026 I know pricing obviously is a key part of your strategy, Noel. But I was particularly intrigued by the pricing in Europe this quarter. I know it was discussed as in relation to cost inflation and maybe a little bit less on the side of the longer-term strategic revenue growth management initiatives. But I was just curious, because the ability to get pricing through in Europe even from a consumer from a competitor standpoint is pretty notable. And I believe, one of your -- a large HPC and food player as we've talked about, an actual a tougher pricing environment in Europe. So I'd love some more color on that if possible. Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. Two things, I think the pricing environment in Europe historically has been extremely difficult, as we all know. That being said, if you go back to a lot of the strategies that we've been putting in place around revenue of management which is a discipline that we're really trying to embed across -- broadly across our commercial organizations, we're finding ways to get pricing into the P&L particularly through how we manage gross to net. Also in Europe is the strength of the elmex brand, obviously Meridol and elmex being strong premium brands with a strong brand loyalty allow us to take more aggressive pricing in those markets. And we've been disciplined to do that on a pretty sequential basis, across that continent. So that has obviously played nicely through the P&L. So I'd say, a combination of revenue growth management discipline really taking hold more work to do to be sure. And some of the strength of our toothpaste equities in that region which have allowed us to take more pricing. And to a certain extent, as we saw more lockdowns early on in the year, the promotional environment was probably a little bit more benign. But we've anticipated that will continue to accelerate as store traffic increases in the back half of the year. Operator : All right. [Operator Instructions] We will take the next question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I just want to go back to the pricing comment. I think what you said, obviously, you have been able to price to inflation in some of these countries. And in particular, you sounded -- Noel, you sounded very positive about LatAm. Do you think you can still pull those levers there? And to John's comment before like if you, have to take more pricing in some places is that like you're trying to price to inflation so that you can go into the guide, because the two other centers as at the end of the prepared remarks implied, as if you're not tracking to the high end of your guide, you're tracking more at this point in the low end. So what would take you to the high-end of the EPS guide? Noel Wallace : Yeah, two aspects to talk to, there's obviously -- there's two implications on, how we think about pricing. There's the foreign exchange aspect, which obviously moves through transactionally into the margin line. And we tend to try to offset that. And there's obviously then commodity inflation that we see locally in the markets and we obviously look to gauge our price increases based on where the market is and what the consumer will bear. But if you take a step back for a minute, it's the strength of our brands, I think in emerging markets that have really allowed us to do more on the pricing line. You talked about Latin America. If you go back last year in Latin America, we took 9.5% pricing in the third quarter 9.5% pricing in the fourth quarter. And I think -- and even if you look at it across emerging markets, it was getting ahead of some of the pricing environment that we've incurred the raw material pricing environment we've seen this year. So as you build that pricing into your P&L that really sets us up for strong growth on the pricing side in 2021. We've continued to take pricing as we've seen an elevated pricing -- inflation environment around raw and packed. And that's allowed us obviously to deliver the gross margins in the quarter. So again, we continue to look at the marketplace. So as I mentioned earlier, our competitors are facing the same level of inflation that we are. And as a result, that environment versus just foreign exchange creates a healthier environment to take pricing particularly in emerging markets. Operator : Okay. We will take the next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey. Good morning, guys. Noel Wallace : Hi, Jason. Jason English : Hey. Thank you for slotting me in. So, I guess, I'll come after the gross margin question, since no one's really pushed into it yet. The inflation rate this quarter, 310 bips drag, it's almost 8% year-on-year COGS inflation. Is it safe to assume that that number should escalate as we progress through the year? And assuming that's the case, which I think seems to be a reasonable assumption, what are the offsets that will escalate in kind to try to help you still get gross margin expansion in this environment, which would truly be phenomenal? Are we looking for more productivity than is typical in the year? Price continuing to climb, or are there other offsets we should consider? Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Jason. I think, we would anticipate, as we\u2019ve built into our guidance that costs will continue to remain inflated as we move through the year. And as we start to lap some of the increases that we saw later in the back half of last year, it will become a little bit more benign in that regard. A couple of things. Obviously, continuing to be highly disciplined about taking pricing and taking it quickly and that will continue to be the case. We've got to be courageous and bold in that regard. Obviously, we watch that carefully, based on what's happening in the local marketplace, but straight price increases will continue to be an important element, as we look at the back half of the year. The revenue growth management aspect we've referred to a couple of times that is an important discipline that we really need to embed across our organizations. And I think we've seen some fruits of that, at least, last year and coming into the first quarter this year. So that will continue to happen. The other important aspect to look at is, if you look at the mix of our business, last year we saw significant lifts from some of the lower-margin categories that were driven by COVID, so things like bar soap and liquid hand soap. As oral care begins to normalize and the category returns to historical trends, that will certainly help from a mix standpoint. Likewise, our professional health business, which obviously was significantly impacted by closures, although that business is starting to come back quite nicely, still not back to where it was from a store opening standpoint, as well as travel retail. And as that continues to unfold through the balance of the year, that will likewise help a bit. And obviously, as foreign exchange, we talked a little bit, not seeing the benefit we initially anticipated, but still somewhat of a benefit that will ultimately help through to the P&L. The other aspect, I'd say, Jason, is moving -- getting volume moving through the P&L in the back half. Obviously, taking pricing allows us to support the advertising and innovation, which is critically important. And we've always said, that's part of our strategy, make sure we get the margin to support the advertising and the investment and that will obviously bode well for the pricing that we see in the back half of -- excuse me, in the volume that we anticipate to improve in the back half of the year. Operator : And the next question is going to be from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Noel Wallace : Hi, Chris. Chris Carey : Hi. Hey. Good morning. How are you? So if we're not mistaken, this is the best two-year stack in Hill's, I guess in like 20 years. And so, I want to understand, just how you view sustainability of consumption trends in the business today, whether you think there are incremental distribution opportunities, as pet ownership has increased, or if you're just gaining market share. Obviously, this one's a little bit harder for us to track, given the channels in which it fits, but basically the concept here is, there's quite a bit of momentum. And just want to get your thoughts on sustainabilities and what you see as the opportunities going forward. Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Chris. And clearly, really, really happy with the progress, because it really underscores and gives us confidence in our strategy, 7% organic on 2020 -- comping 2020 last year is terrific. So a couple of aspects that excite us relative to the category. One, you mentioned that the pet ownership is up. That's an annuity, quite frankly, for the category. As you see pet ownership increase, obviously, those pets need to be fed and that will ultimately play back in the dynamics of the category moving forward. Second is, the aspects associated with our business, low penetrated business for Hill's, low brand awareness business for Hill's. So that, again, underscores and underpins the strategy that we have, continue to increase investment, continue to drive core innovation and continue to drive premium innovation on the prescription diet, particularly as we see consumers returning into the vet space or returning to visit their vets. That will, obviously, bode well for the Prescription Diet business. But again tough comps moving forward to be sure, but the business has real momentum not only in the US, which continues to perform exceptionally well, but emerging markets likewise had a terrific quarter and a lot of head space there for us. But we're being very methodical and thoughtful on how we generate this growth. We're looking for long-term sustainable profitable growth building the brands and markets and doing that the right way. And we have the momentum to do that and the flexibility in the P&L. Obviously, we've seen some rising prices on agricultural commodities and we need to take some pricing as we did. But overall, the health of the business underscored by pet ownership, the low brand awareness and penetration that we have gives us confidence that we can continue to drive this business forward. Operator : All right. And your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. Good morning. Just on the housekeeping. The plant in India, I think -- correct me, if I'm wrong, but I think that has a fair bit of export business throughout the rest of the region. So, just wondering, if you're worried about that, if you think there could be any disruption there, you should be getting people to the plan. I know, you don't want to comment on the operations. I'm just thinking about your business in the region, whether that plant is still a big deal from an export perspective, and if there could be any pressure from the outbreak right now? But then my other question is, you haven't talked much about the skin care business. And I'm just wondering, sort of big picture how are trends there? Again, apart from COVID, but I know you were going to distribute or expand distribution for example in China, how is that going? How are you feeling about the prestige skin care business, et cetera, et cetera? If you could just give an update there. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Sure. So obviously, we're concerned about India obviously, given what's going on with the case counts in the country. That being said, you've heard us talk time and time again for the last 15 months that, the health and safety of our employees remains number one. We have taken significant precautions across India to ensure that the health and safety of our employees is there. And with those efforts, we're pleased to say that, we continue to operate all of our plants in India with no disruption. Our most significant plant there, a good percentage of the employees have been vaccinated, which is terrific. And we're seeing obviously, the performance of that plant relative to not only India for the region, continue to deliver against expectations. That being said, we can't control, whatever the government decides to do in terms of further lockdowns. But at this stage, the plant is being run extremely well and the business across the region is benefiting from that capacity. Relative to professional skin obviously, a tough, tough year for professional skin, particularly given the channels that we're focused on whether it\u2019d be spas, dermatologists or travel retail. But all those businesses are slowly coming back. And we saw good performance of the skin health business in the first quarter. In fact, that business was up double digit. We're seeing a return to offices and the foot traffic going back into the professional space, increasing month in and month out, obviously not back to where we were pre-COVID, but the trends are positive, particularly across North America. The one outlier is obviously still the travel retail business in China. While travel retail has moved internal to China, the real travel retail historically which was a good part of the business has not returned. And we expect to start to see that loosen up a bit in the back half. But again, we spent a lot of time in 2020, building capabilities and really learning the business, getting the innovation profile right, to set us up for good growth in 2021. Operator : Okay. And your next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Noel, my question this morning relates to profitability in your North America business. Sales growth clearly under pressure, cycling some difficult year-over-year comparisons, so you had volume deleverage, higher commodities logistics and supply chain issues. But nevertheless it was a low watermark for segment margins in a very long time. So there have been a lot of discussion on pricing, but I wanted to at a more granular level talk about, what percentage of your portfolio in North America specifically in the US really, do you think that you can cover through pricing? What has already been announced to retailers? The environment here certainly seems a lot more amenable currently than it had been even just a few months ago for obvious reasons here in terms of retailer receptivity. And then just sort of rounding it out what should the market expect in terms of margin recovery here in the segment for the balance of the year? So, thanks for that. Noel Wallace : Sure. So, we kind of experienced a perfect storm in the US in the first quarter. Obviously, the category expectations that we had declined more than we anticipated faster and deeper quite frankly. On top of that, we obviously saw a significant increase in raw materials more than expected. Third and this was the biggest piece versus our expectations was logistics. Two issues there. Obviously, the capacity and cost of logistics broadly across the US have gone up quite significantly and that was exacerbated by a specific event that we had in a warehouse that we were opening up and had some transition issues associated with that that compounded our problems. So, with that those -- the warehouse issues are quickly moving behind us. Our service levels are quickly returning to where they were but it certainly had a short-term impact both from a sales standpoint a market share standpoint and importantly, from an operating margin standpoint. That being said, if I characterize a little bit about what's going on in the US, I mean the categories were quite concerning obviously moving through the March period where we saw significant declines more than we anticipated. But the silver lining here I think on North America is we've seen categories in the last two weeks come back nicely. In fact, particularly, around the toothpaste category, which is rebounding up double digits in the last two weeks, particularly as we see store traffic and foot traffic return to stores. We've got a good innovation pipeline planned and as you saw we've maintained our support which we think is extremely important to continue to obviously drive volume and share in the back half and we're laser-focused on logistics and raw material costs. Relative to pricing again revenue growth management we're not going to talk to our plans on price increases at this time, but it's a market where everyone is certainly looking at that aspect very, very closely. And I anticipate that you'll see more price increases across the sector given the headwinds that everyone has faced in this space. But again, we're focused on this. I think the team's got a good handle of what's going on get the service issue behind us which it is and we'll move forward. Q2 will continue to be a very difficult comp for the US. As you saw last year, we had significant growth in Q2 as well. And so that will be a difficult comp but it'll be dependent highly on where the categories end up as we move forward. Operator : All right. And we'll take the next question from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Hey thanks. So, we've talked a lot about pricing. You just mentioned again there Noel, I guess, I'm thinking about in the context of your underlying strategy the mix shift towards premium innovation. So, in light of the uncertainties that you called out on emerging markets and some of the volatility we've seen in developed market category trends and just the notion that there's inflationary pressure building on the consumer shopping basket not only in your categories, but more broadly, does that impact at all what you anticipate in terms of consumer appetite for that premium innovation that you're bringing to market, especially if the prices associated with it are going higher? Just curious how you're thinking about that? Whether those considerations vary at all by region or across categories and whether it's impacted at all how you're choosing to prioritize investments over the balance of the year. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks Steve. No, it has not distracted us from our strategy. Premiumization continues to be a very important element. We've talked a lot with you regarding our refocused orientation on innovation between H1, H2, and H3 very much focused on the aspects of H1 and H2, which are premium brands. And if you look at the growth of Oral Care in the first quarter, particularly, toothpaste a good percentage of that came from our premiumization strategy. I'll give you a good example. Good shares in Brazil holding shares despite a pretty competitive environment. Our premium business in Brazil alone was 27% of our business roughly I think in 2018. It's up to 30% of our business year-to-date and it's up 120 basis points versus last year. So, a good indication that the launch of the Colgate Tartar Control some of the natural extracts bundles, the launch of elmex in the market there, those are important initiatives to continue to close our index and we still have a ways to go to close the index that we've talked about. So premiumization will continue to play. And I don't think quite frankly, even though some of these markets will be under pressure economically, the fact that we have innovation across all of our price points and historically, we play very aggressively both in the opening as well as the mid-price, we think we have the ability to leverage our portfolio effectively as we see the economic circumstances change. But again premiumization will continue to be a focus.  You saw it in Asia, particularly where we're launching and leading with premium innovation in our online business in Asia. Our online business continues to grow. I think it was up over 200 basis points year-to-date. So again, supporting the fact that the premiumization strategy is working and will be agile relative to how we see the market evolve; and need be we will play more in the mid and opening should that be necessary.  I think what's importantly is we get more and more consumers back into stores, historically, that is where we have performed so well and our ability to generate more volume and pricing opportunities as consumers track back into the shopping environment bodes well. But that being said, I'll also say our e-commerce business continues to perform exceptionally well. That was a big growth driver for us and it's comping a difficult number last year. We continue to show strong growth and our shares are pretty consistently up across the board in the online environment. Operator : And we will take our next question from Bill Chappell with Truist Securities. Bill Chappell : Thanks. Good morning. Noel Wallace : Good morning. Bill Chappell : Just a question around kind of capital allocation and any thoughts there? For years, the company had a pretty steady share repurchase program that's kind of faded over the past two, three years. M&A activity seems to be really picking up within the industry as everybody is kind of looking for a new home as we get into 2021. Any kind of changes to the thought process over the next year? Noel Wallace : Actually, no. I mean our strategy continues to be very consistent with what we've articulated in the past, reinvesting in the business with the high ROIC that we have. We continue to see real opportunities to invest in capacity and cost-saving projects around the world and that is indeed exactly what we're doing. So that will continue to be our priority. Obviously, as M&A comes available we've been conservative in that regard. We'll be selective as we see some strategic gaps in our portfolio, we may look to bring those in.  But right now, we're very focused on what we have in the current portfolio. We think we've got significant opportunities still to expand and really build our skin health business out the way we want to. We've got the Hello acquisition coming in. And obviously, some of the challenges that the Natural segment experienced particularly in North America getting those behind us and moving forward with the expansion of that brand around the world. So we're focused on what we have.  And then obviously we'll continue to pay the dividend and we've increased share buybacks this year as we had outlined in our guidance coming out of 2020 when we were paying down the debt. So that comes back to historical numbers. So no real change there. We continue to be very flexible as we see opportunities and maintaining a strong balance sheet continues to be of paramount importance to us. Operator : And the next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Thanks. And good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about ad spend and market share. So ad spend has grown ahead of sales since at least 2018. How long does that continue? And where does it normalize as a percentage of sales? And I guess related to that does market share factor into that thinking -- especially given the numbers that you disclosed in the release is around what has been sustained share loss in Oral Care especially now that FX is favorable as well as the commentary earlier in the call about the importance of the category to gross margin? So maybe if you could tie that into together that'd be helpful. Noel Wallace : Yes. We don't have a specific target in mind for advertising. There's so many inputs that go into thinking about how and where we spend money. We're being more strategic on where we spend our money. That is underscored by the innovation strategy that we've outlined relative -- particularly premiumization, which in our view requires the right level of advertising to seed it. And so as a result of that, there's not a specific number that we're looking at. I think the most important aspect for us is continued sustainable profitable growth. And you've seen that now quite consistently over the previous couple of years. And that's the barometer we're holding ourselves to is to continue to drive that top line. We obviously now have the ability as we shift more and more money into digital to really assess the performance of that spend and that makes the economics and efficiency of our advertising that much better as we think about how we want to spend and where we want to spend. And so we -- as we see the opportunities unfold as we see the plethora of brands and innovation that we have to support we'll continue to put money in advertising as we're seeing a return on that investment. And I think you've seen that. It's all kind of obviously linked. We've got premium innovation driving gross margin That puts more dollar margin into the P&L and ultimately transfers into better advertising more advertising support more capabilities and more EPS. And so it's a balance across all of it. There's not one specific goal we're looking to achieve. And I think we're getting better at putting our advertising where we see the right returns and being selective both from a category and a geography standpoint on how we do that. Hill's is a great example of that. We've obviously deliberately and strategically put more money into that business and you've seen the payback on that quite clearly. Operator : And your next question is from Kamil Jagrulla with Credit Suisse. Kamil Jagrulla : Noel you just mentioned there's a lot of inputs that go into where you spend your money. As you're kind of thinking about coming out of COVID and you think about your -- the various divisions the various pieces of your portfolio has anything changed in terms of where you want to deploy capital? And maybe specifically to talk about are you thinking about the cleaning side any differently? Maybe there's other parts of the business you might be thinking about differently like doubling down on Hill's for example. Can you maybe just talk about what has evolved a little bit now that we're on the other side of this or likely on the other side of this? Noel Wallace : Yes. Without getting into too much detail we've spent a significant amount of time looking at our 2025 strategic plan. And in that strategic plan I think what's very notable and different for us is making tough choices on where we're going to invest our money. And rather than being somewhat democratic in that process and as a result of that coming out of COVID we're going to continue to be laser-focused on executing against our strategy. And that involves us taking money and putting it where we think we're going to get the best return through the P&L on that. And it's building businesses and geographies that we believe will deliver long-term sustainable profitable growth. It's building businesses that have the right demographics and category opportunity in terms of growth potential for them. And obviously making sure that the mix of our spending and the mix of our innovation continues to be premiumized which requires investment. And you couple that with obviously the need to continue to support a lot of that organic stuff that we do on the market. We talked about per capita consumption programs as a result of our focus on education and doing things of that nature. So all these aspects are critically important to driving the investment strategy so to speak. So again it's just built on I think a well thought through strategic plan. It's anchored against making good choices of where we want to spend. And certainly as we see the categories unfold in the back half of the year, we'll continue to allocate accordingly based on where we see the best growth opportunity. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. Just -- first just a kind of a detailed question. I'm sorry I missed it. Your corporate expenses were a good bit higher than, I think most people modeled. Was -- did that have to do with the warehousing issues that you referenced? And if so, how much of it was related to that, or what other sorts of investments are you doing there? And then second, you mentioned that in general you're gaining share in e-commerce. Can you just kind of give us a little bit more detail in terms of the percentage of the business that's in e-commerce maybe detail on the growth rates in the US, China Europe? Just a little bit more granularity would be terrific? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks Rob. On the corporate side, actually when you look at the SG&A line that was driven by logistics and advertising. So if you strip out just our corporate fixed costs, our corporate fixed costs pleasingly were actually down in that equation. So I think a lot of the productivity initiatives that we're focused on across the P&L and managing cost actually delivered a fixed cost reduction in the quarter, which was terrific to see. Moving on to specifically e-commerce, I mean, obviously the growth numbers are terrific across the board relative to our focus there. And as you look at market share increases we've seen those in North America. We've seen those in Hill's. We're seeing those in Asia quite nicely. We're seeing those in Latin America. In fact, I got some India numbers that look outstanding. So again, where we're focusing time, and effort, and certainly putting the investment there we're seeing a good return on that. I think that bodes well as we continue to see the growth of e-commerce. We exited the year at double digit on e-commerce and that number has accelerated in the first quarter. So I think the focus and strategies we have in place continue to be well received in the marketplace. I'll give you one data point. We're up 260 basis points versus the first quarter last year on a percent of sales on our e-commerce business. So, again, I think it's growing quite nicely, and importantly driving market share of new users into the franchise. Operator : Thank you. Mr. Wallace, it appears there are no further questions at this time. Noel Wallace : Okay. Well, thanks everyone. So that obviously concludes our call. And again, we're really pleased on how we started the year. And we've got a lot to do. We're excited about what's ahead of us, but there's no question a lot of volatility and challenges. But we've got an incredible culture at Colgate and our entire team of 3,000, 4,000 people are deeply focused on delivering strong results, while ensuring that we continue to adapt to a rapidly changing environment and wining the future. So I just want to thank everyone for their continued support on our business, and look forward to talking to everyone very soon. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to today's Colgate-Palmolive Company's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John. John Faucher : Thanks, Heidi. Good morning and welcome to our 2021 second quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 8 and 9 six of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. I will provide commentary on our Q2 performance as well as our latest thoughts on 2021 guidance before turning it over to Noel to provide his thoughts on the current operating environment and how we will continue to deliver on our growth trajectory. We will then open it up for Q&A. As usual, we request that you limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible get to ask a question. If you have further questions, you are welcome to re-enter the queue. As we report results at the halfway point in 2021, we remain pleased, but not satisfied with our performance so far as we navigate through what can charitably be described as a complicated year. For both the second quarter and on a year-to-date basis, we delivered growth in organic sales, net sales, operating profit and net income. This is despite difficult comparisons, as we lack last year's strengthen in categories like liquid hand soap and dish soap. We are also dealing with the impact of COVID restrictions in several markets, economic and political uncertainty, strong competitive activity, and of course, significantly heightened raw material and logistics headwinds. We expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our business through the second half of this year. Because of that, we remain focused on delivering impactful innovation, leveraging our revenue growth management capabilities to deliver on pricing, and driving productivity up and down the income statement. All of these are crucial to deliver long-term sustainable growth. They will help us as we look to deliver TSR at the high-end of our peer group. We delivered 5% organic sales growth in the second quarter, which marked our 10th consecutive quarter delivering organic sales growth either in or above our targeted range of 3% to 5%. As we have discussed before, the key to delivering against our long-term target is delivering balanced growth, which we did once again in the quarter by delivering both volume and pricing growth. We delivered growth in both developed markets with 3% organic sales growth and emerging markets, which delivered 7% organic sales growth. We delivered organic sales growth in every division, but North America. Our largest category, Oral Care, delivered organic sales growth of nearly 10% with organic sales growth across toothpaste, manual toothbrushes and electric toothbrushes and organic sales growth in every division. Innovation continues to be a vital contributor to our Oral Care business as we benefit from new products across all of our divisions. Products like CO. by Colgate, Colgate Elixir toothpaste, and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste are all delivering consumer desired benefits and premiumizing our portfolio. Pet nutrition delivered organic sales growth of 15%. Personal Care and Home Care declined on an organic sales basis year-over-year in the quarter as expected, but net sales remain above 2019 levels. Net sales increased 9.5% in the quarter, which was our highest net sales increase in almost 10 years. Foreign exchange was a 4.5% benefit to net sales as we lapped the peak of last year's COVID driven strength in the dollar. After strong gross margin performance in 2020 and in Q1, our gross margin declined in the second quarter due to the rapid acceleration of raw material costs across our business and the lapping of lower promotional levels in Q2 2020. We took additional pricing in the second quarter which will help offset raw material costs in the second half of the year, and we will continue to layer in additional pricing were possible. We expect raw material costs to remain elevated throughout 2021. But we do expect some sequential lessening of inflation as we get into the fourth quarter. Our efforts on premiumization and pricing along with our focus on productivity, like our funding the growth initiatives, will also help us as we look to improve our gross margin performance. In the second quarter, our gross profit margin was 60.0%, which was down 80 basis points year-over-year on both the GAAP basis and the Base Business basis. Year-to-date, our gross margin is 60.4%, down 10 basis points. Again, that is on a GAAP and Base Business basis. For the second quarter, pricing was 90 basis points favorable to gross margin, less than in the first quarter as we lapped lower promotional spending in the year-ago period, when many of our markets reacted to COVID restrictions by pulling back on promotional activity. Raw materials were 370 basis point headwind, as we continue to see significant pressure from resins, fats and oils and agriculture-related costs and many other materials. This includes a slightly favorable transactional impact from foreign exchange. Productivity was a 200 basis point benefit. Our SG&A was up 100 basis points as a percent of sales for the second quarter on both a GAAP and Base Business basis. This was primarily driven by an increase in logistics costs, and also by a 30 basis point increase in advertising to sales. Excluding advertising and logistics, our SG&A ratio declined year-over-year as our net sales growth and savings programs drove leverage on our overheads. For the second quarter on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 5.5% year-over-year, while it was up 2.5% on a Base Business basis. Our EPS was up 12% on a GAAP basis, and up 8% on a Base Business basis. Our free cash flow was down year-over-year in the quarter as we continue to lap very strong working capital performance in the year-ago period. As we discussed previously, our capital expenditures are also up year-over-year as we invest behind growth, productivity and our sustainability strategy. A few comments on divisional performance. North America net sales declined 4% in the second quarter, with organic sales down 4.5% and a modest benefit from foreign exchange. Volumes were down 8.5% in the quarter, driven by Home Care and Personal Care, which saw strong growth in the year-ago period driven by COVID related demand. Pricing across Home Care and Personal Care was positive as we work to offset higher raw material costs. Oral Care organic sales grew mid single digits driven by innovation and pricing. I mentioned CO. by Colgate before, which is helping us further expand into the beauty and direct-to-consumer channels. We are pleased with the initial performance of the Colgate Keep manual toothbrush. It comes with an aluminum handle and by using our replaceable heads, consumers can use 80% less plastic compared to similarly sized Colgate toothbrushes. We're also excited about our Tom's of Maine relaunch, which is bringing new graphics and advertising to a historic natural segment brand. Our logistics issues that we discussed on the first quarter call continued to negatively impact our promotional timing, but service levels have improved and we expect our promotional cadence will normalize as we go through the third quarter. Latin American net sales were up 12.5% with 8.5% organic sales growth and a 400 basis point benefit from foreign exchange. All three categories delivered organic sales growth in the quarter with Oral Care organic sales growth in the high teens. Brazil and Mexico both grew organic and net sales double digits in the quarter. Our strong innovation performance was led by core innovation behind Colgate Total Reinforced Gums in Mexico, which apparently sounds much better in Spanish and Portuguese than English, and several charcoal variants in Brazil. Volume of plus 2.5% in the quarter, despite a sizable negative impact due to political unrest in Colombia, our third largest market in Latin America. We believe this disruption which negatively impacted our distribution network for some time is largely behind us. But political disruption will remain a risk not just in Colombia, but in several markets. Pricing was up 6% despite lapping lower promotional spending in Q2 2020 as well as some incremental pricing in the year-ago period as we look to offset foreign exchange. Europe net sales grew 15% in the quarter. Organic sales grew 5% driven by mid teens growth in Oral Care, offset by declines in Personal and Home Care as we lap COVID related demand in the year-ago period. Volume grew 7% in the quarter offset by a 2% decline in pricing as we lapped lower promotions in the year-ago period as store traffic declined in Q2 2020 due to COVID restrictions. I mentioned Colgate Elixir toothpaste before and we're very excited about this truly differentiated product. We designed it with more of a beauty aesthetic, including skincare inspired ingredients, a unique clear recyclable bottle and liquid glide technology that allows the pace to leave the bottle leaving no messy tube or cap. This product began rolling out across the division in Q2 with further launches this quarter. We delivered 7.5% net sales and 1% organic sales growth in Asia Pacific this quarter, with organic growth in Oral Care partially offset by a decline in Home Care. Volume growth of 3.5% was partially offset by negative pricing as we cycled lower promotional levels in the year-ago period given COVID related lockdowns across the region, with the biggest impact coming on our South Pacific business. We have additional pricing planned in the second half across the division to offset raw material cost inflation. Volume growth was led by India, despite the impact of COVID related disruption in May and Thailand, driven by Naturals innovation in the Colgate Vedshakti and Colgate Panjaved line as we lapped COVID related disruptions in the year-ago period. Our volume in China declined on growth on the Colgate business, which was more than offset by weakness in sales for our Hawley & Hazel joint venture, which is primarily related to inventory reductions in our distributor network. Afro-Eurasia continued its strong performance trends in the third quarter, with net sales growth of 15.5% as we delivered strong organic sales growth throughout the division once again. Volume grew 9.5% in the quarter, while pricing was up 3.5%. Foreign exchange was a 2.5% benefit in the quarter. Oral Care delivered high teens organic sales growth, and we are relaunching several of our natural businesses with new packaging and flavors. Hill's strong growth continued in the second quarter with 18% net sales growth and 15% organic sales growth. Both developed and emerging markets delivered 10% volume growth as our increased investment around the globe is driving this highly differentiated brands. In particular, we are seeing good results from our Hill's Master brand campaign to end Pet obesity as well as our new campaign for Hill's Pet Essentials, our vet distributed wellness product in Europe. And now for guidance. We still expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range. There was no meaningful change in our category expectations at this point. The categories that benefited from COVID related demand are behaving in line with our expectations with sales below 2020 levels, but ahead of 2019 levels. Please note that given widespread COVID outbreaks in many of our markets, we could still see an impact from government actions to stem the spread of COVID and other disruptions related to COVID and this is not in our guidance. Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low single-digit benefit for the year, although slightly less favorable than when we gave guidance in April. All-in, we still expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%. We have reduced our gross margin guidance for the year, and we now expect gross margin to be down year-over-year for the full year on both a GAAP and Base Business basis, given the additional cost inflation we have seen. We expect the gross margin percentage to improve sequentially in the second half, which would leave us down modestly for the year. As I mentioned above, we're taking many steps to mitigate the impact of these costs, including additional pricing, optimizing trade spending, accelerating FTG where available and many others. Advertising is still expected to be up on both $1 and a percent of sales basis. Logistics will continue to be a headwind, as costs also have risen faster than anticipated, particularly in the U.S. We still expect these costs to moderate somewhat as we go through the balance of the year. Our tax rate is now expected to be between 23% and 24% for the year on both a GAAP and Base Business basis. On a GAAP basis, we still expect earnings per share growth in the low to mid single digits, but most likely towards the lower end of that range. On a Base Business basis, we continue to expect earnings per share growth in the mid to high single digits. Again, we would expect to land at the lower end of that range. And with that, I'll turn it over to Noel. Noel Wallace : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Hope you're all safe and well this morning. So the overriding message I want to leave with you today is that our strategy to reaccelerate profitable growth by focusing on our core adjacencies all over the world, new channels and markets is really working. As we'd like to say nothing moves in a straight line, but we now have 10 straight quarters of organic sales growth at or above our long-term target range. Year-to-date, we're at the high-end of the range despite difficult comparisons, and continued volatility in the business. We're making good progress on our journey, but we still have more work to do. And as I look back at my comments to you over the past 18 months that we've been dealing with the implications of COVID, there's one consistent theme that we keep coming back to, managing through this crisis with an eye on the future. This is still the appropriate theme, although obviously, some of the elements have changed. The prevalence of the vaccine in many developed markets gives us a sense of guarded optimism. But we've highlighted that many emerging markets which represent almost half of our revenues, the availability of the vaccine remains a very -- remains very low. Case rates are high, and governments continue to put in restrictions to help stop the spread of the virus. We remain hopeful that we will get to a post-COVID sooner rather than later, but we're not there yet. We will continue to manage to the retail and supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer behavior and government actions to stem the spread of the virus, all while doing our best to protect the health and safety of our employees, which remains our number one priority. But there are changing headwinds as well. Last year, we were faced with adverse foreign exchange movements, heightened consumer and customer demand, supply chain volatility, and uncertainty for our customers about changing business models and retail environments. This year, we're faced with unprecedented cost increases raw materials like resin, fats and oils and many others. Logistic networks are taxed, whether it's the trucking and warehousing here in the U.S., or ocean freight coming from Asia to the rest of the world. And we're seeing some political disruption in markets like Colombia and Myanmar. So 18 months into the COVID, many of the challenges are the same. Some have changed, but our approach remains we will manage through the crisis with an eye on the future. And so far, we feel we've done a pretty good job. But we know the markets look forward at our potential not backwards at our achievements. We know that to deliver top tier TSR we need to balance this organic sales growth with volume and pricing, all four of our categories and across all of our divisions. We've talked to you a lot about our changes in strategy that will enable us to continue delivering this balanced growth. First is our focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation. John discussed many of these in his commentary, and this improved innovation is a direct result of the changes that Pat and I discussed during our CAGNY presentation. Our emphasis is on faster growing channels and markets continues to pay off to growth in e-commerce, direct-to-consumer, discounters, club stores and pharmacies. We are taking formerly regional brands like Tom's of Maine, Hello, Elmex and Meridol and launching them in select markets and channels to take the advantage of their strong brand equities, and ongoing consumer trends. We're supporting these efforts with increased focus on our digital media and emerging data and analytical capabilities. But we have to deliver gross margin expansion to fund our brand investment. While we know it -- while we now expect gross margin could be down modestly for 2021, it comes on the heels of strong gross margin expansion in 2020 and in the face of unprecedented increases in raw material prices. We will continue to leverage our robust revenue growth management program and drive productivity so we can return to gross margin expansion. We have made progress in our journey to improve our mix, but we have further upside potential on this given the benefits we provide to consumers and the fact that our brands under indexing pricing relative to the category across many geographies. We're working to accelerate our productivity programs like funding the growth wherever possible to try and create additional offsets. All this should help us in our drive to return to gross margin expansion. And while the raw material inflation is obviously negatively impacting our gross margin performance this year, we're optimistic that this raw material inflation could drive an improvement in emerging market fundamentals. Again, we need to first get through the difficulty surrounding COVID that on the back of our continued rebound in emerging market organic sales growth, particularly in Latin America, we have some optimism that we could choose some additional GDP growth and therefore higher category growth on the back end of this movement in commodities. We have seen some of the emerging market currency stabilize for the first time in what seems like several years, and they're optimistic this may be a first step. And since our last call, we have released our 2025 sustainability strategy. This comprehensive plan highlights the actions we're taking around climate, plastics, sourcing, diversity, equity and inclusion and all the other areas that are vital to the future not only of our company, but our communities and our planet. And with that, I'll open it up to your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : Hey, good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to ask around Latin America in the quarter. I know it's not all the same category and country exposure. But the read through from a lot of other companies that have reported thus far was that the region was really strong with most seeing better performance sequentially. So I know you mentioned Columbia, so is there any way to quantify how much of a headwind you think the disruptions they're causing the quarter? And then maybe just more broadly, can you provide an update on your performance versus the category in the region? And how you're thinking about growth in the back half of the year, just kind of on the heels of your positive GDP commentary there? Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Peter. Overall, we're really, really happy with Latin America. You mentioned that, obviously, we saw significant headwinds from the Columbia disruption, which in many respects took almost a month of sales out of that specific country. And despite that, we obviously still delivered very strong top line growth. If you look at our two key markets, Mexico and Brazil, both delivering double-digit growth in the quarter. You've seen now Brazil deliver four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. So obviously, the market seems to be returning despite the fact that we're definitely not out of the woods relative to COVID. But we think as vaccinations improve, particularly in those markets that will continue to help categories. Categories are up on the year, which is good. Despite the fact that we still see limited mobility, we still see some disruptions in particularly the down trade around how retail environments are behaving. But overall, the categories are up, which is good. We had strong innovation in the quarter. We got some good innovation on our core business Colgate Total, which John mentioned, which is driving good share growth. We resist a little bit of the transactional couponing and deep discount in some of those markets. Overall, we've lost a little bit of promotional share, but our baseline shares look good. And the innovation process plans we have in place for the back half are strong as well. Likewise on pricing, we've always been a strong driver of pricing in those markets. We continue to obviously see a lot of headwinds on commodity prices, particularly on tallow prices coming out of Brazil. And we're ramping up for obviously a strong back half relative to how we see pricing evolving, and obviously continuing to drive the volume in the quarter. So overall, I think we're pleased despite the fact that Columbia was a significant headwind to the quarter. Bear in mind, if you look at the overall of Latin America, that region continues to perform exceptionally well on balance, 10.3 -- 10.6 in the fourth quarter, 9.5 in the first, and 8.5 now. So again, I think despite the headwinds, good consistent growth. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. Noel, I'm wondering if you could go around the world and talk a little bit about your actual pricing power. I think we all understand less promos, and that was an effect on the reported pricing in Europe and Asia. Obviously, there's mixed effects. But if we kind of clear through all that, can you talk about actual headline pricing that you got in the quarter or that you expect to get later in the year? And to what extent you're able to do that given disposable income in the various markets and competitive activity. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure, Rob. Thank you. So let me start macro. Obviously, if you look at developing markets versus developed, developing have obviously moved pricing a little faster than the developed world. And when I say developed, I'm referring to Europe and the U.S. We've seen good pricing movements in Latin America, good pricing movements in Africa. And we've seen competition likewise in those regions follows. Similarly, in Asia, John mentioned in the upfront comments that we took some pricing obviously in the fourth -- first quarter. We were lapping promotions from the second quarter last year, although we have pricing planned quite aggressively in the back half across the Asia region. If you take the developed world, U.S has been a little slow in terms of the market. I think everyone is focusing on promotions and couponings to drive pricing. We haven't seen a lot of list price changes in North America yet and I would say that particularly holds true for Europe as well. Our strategy continues to be as we've outlined, very disciplined approach to revenue growth management. We're taking list pricing where we see the opportunity. We're optimizing our promotional spend, we're looking at price tag architecture, we're looking at all the levers within in revenue growth management to drive pricing overall. The other point is, as you've heard, we're very focused on premium innovation. We continue to under index as I've mentioned, and that's a real opportunity for us to drive overall gross margin percent and dollars, as we look at the back half of the year. So I think the headline is pricing, is going to have to come up in the back half. Everyone is faced with the same challenges. And we anticipate that as we move into the back half, we'll see a little bit better environment around developed markets and continue to focus on our revenue growth management discipline across the world to do that with. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kamil Jagrulla with Credit Suisse. Kamil Jagrulla : Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. A couple questions on local competition. It wasn't really that long ago we were talking about market share gains from local competition in a very in a variety of your kind of major markets. Can you maybe talk about how that's evolved through the pandemic? What position were in -- you're in now, particularly maybe as it relates to pricing couponing promo right at a time where it's necessary to push the pricing through the market because of inflation? Noel Wallace : Sure. Kamil, thanks for the question. We talked about, I think, throughout 2020 and perhaps touched on it a bit in the first quarter, the strength of our brands and the efficacy of our brands has certainly brought consumers back into the mainstream, so to speak. I mean, a lot of the local brands relative to the credibility they had in the market, which was questionable, we saw consumers returning to big brands and certainly trusted brands in the market. And that was very prevalent in market and categories, like Personal Care, like Home Care, like pet nutrition as well as Oral Care, quite frankly. And so that certainly has benefited us in terms of how we've seen the categories evolve. And I think that will continues particularly given the overarching issues around COVID around the world, consumers are still looking for big, trusted, efficacious brands. And we expect that to continue as we move through the balance of the year. John Faucher : Kamil, it's John. If I could add something to that, what I would say is, if you look at the success of the local brands over the last 5 or 6 years, it's been a lot of differentiated benefits. Naturals -- the way Naturals is expressed in a number of different markets, different types of packaging, different media strategies, and mostly at premium prices. So as I think as you look at our innovation strategy that Noel talked about, and you look at the type of innovation we're putting out, whether it's Elixir in Europe, or whether it's a Naturals relaunch in Afro-Eurasia, we have the ability to compete more effectively with some of these local brands, and we can drive that premiumization at the same time. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning, everyone. It's actually [indiscernible] on for Andrea. Thanks for taking the question. So just at a high-level, can you maybe talk a little bit more about some of the specific actions that you plan to take to help reverse some of those share losses, particularly in the U.S., really in the core toothpaste and distribution categories? Noel Wallace : Sure. Obviously, the North America performance was below our expectations. We had a lot of factors driving that. Obviously, the impact of logistics challenges that we alluded to in the first quarter, we continue to have some case fill [ph] issues in the second quarter, which obviously had an impact on our promotional ability to put promotions in the market and obviously therefore share. We're working those behind us. And as we move into the back half, those will be ideally gone. So we expect some of that to come back. We've pushed a lot of the premiumization. That market has become highly competitive. We saw increased activity in promotion and couponing in the second quarter. We have adjusted our plans for the back half of the year and our guidance reflects those plans for North America. Likewise in the dish business, we saw similar promotional activity, we've adjusted our promotional plans for the back half. So by and large, we saw obviously some logistics challenge and competitive activity. Obviously some of the comparisons that we had last year dealing with elevated categories, obviously softening the dish liquid and the liquid hand soap category in the second quarter, but we anticipate as we move through the back half things will set down, and we have strong innovation and promotion plans to rebuild the North America shares. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Carey : Hi. Thanks so much for the question. I had a question specifically on China. I\u2019m conscious the margins were better in APAC than the rest of the world, but also on a pullback in marketing spending with China declining. Can you just provide any additional perspective on what you're seeing in that market, and maybe by category and the rationale behind the marketing and how you see that going forward? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. So as John alluded to in his comments, we did see some weakness in the China business from our Hawley & Hazel partner that was specifically driven by -- that's a business that heavily driven down trade. We have very strong distribution in CDE cities and as we've seen e-commerce continue to grow, our distributor network has been cautious on managing inventories as we've seen the brick-and-mortar categories, fundamentally flat not growing so far in the first half of the year. As e-commerce will potentially continue to accelerate and those inventories get drawn down, we expect that will sort of through in the back half of the year. Importantly, I think we're seeing terrific growth on our e-commerce business, as we talked about over the last couple quarters. In fact, our Colgate franchise and our Darlie franchise were two of the three fastest growing brands in e-commerce retail environment in the quarter. And obviously up significantly versus where we were in the first quarter from a share standpoint, which is really nice to see. That's driven behind a lot of good premium innovation that we've had in the quarter, the miracle repair continues to do well. We've launched a series of premium Enzyme toothpaste as well. So that continues to perform well. And the advertising is there in the back half to continue to grow that business as we go out the year. So we're comfortable with where we are from an advertising standpoint. Obviously, the comps versus a quarter last year where we had drawn down a bit of our advertising, we saw a little bit of elevation in Asia in the second quarter, but good plans in the back half to continue to drive share. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Chris Armes : Hey, everyone. Good morning. This is actually Chris Armes on for Mark. Just wanted to talk a little bit about Hill's growth, obviously very good. Maybe on the growth, if you could parse out how much is share gains versus just elevated category growth? Can you kind of talk also about growth by geography? And then also the growth from kind of new -- from expansion to new markets versus existing markets? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure, Chris. Yes, overall, listen, Hill's had another fantastic quarter, 50% comping, obviously a really strong quarter last year where we did double-digit growth as well. So we're hitting on all cylinders on that business. Growth is across the world. We had all of our regions up with exception of Japan. Market share is up across the board typically and where we're gaining market share is mainly in the U.S., which is our largest market as you know. We saw a good share growth across most retail environments, both on the Base Business, the Science Diet business as well as the Prescription Diet business, that's behind a continued focus on the strategy, which is the core renovation, premium innovation, new channels, in this case continuing to grow online as well as farm and feed. And obviously continuing to see an increase in the Prescription Diet business, which has more and more pet owners return to their vets, we see the benefit of vet coming through as well. So across the board, very strong growth and we continue to obviously invest for growth in that business. And that continues to be the strategy moving into the back half of this year. Operator : That will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Noel Wallace : Thank you. Obviously, an extremely volatile quarter. But again, I think we're continuing to execute our strategy. As we've talked about, for the last couple years, some real opportunities ahead and some challenges that will face as we have in the past. And so I'd simply want to extend my thanks to all the Colgate people listening for their incredible resilience during these difficult times and look forward to a good back half of the company. Thank you. Operator : That will conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation.",

I will provide commentary on our Q3 performance, as well as our latest thoughts on 2021 guidance, before turning it over to Noel to provide his thoughts on how we will continue to deliver on our growth trajectory. We will then open it up for Q&A.  As usual, we request that you limit yourself to one question, so that as many people as possible get to ask a question. If you have further questions, you are welcome to reenter the queue. Our focus on innovation, premiumization, pricing, and productivity allowed us to deliver solid Q3 and year-to-date results, despite a very difficult operating environment. We continue to deliver against our targets because we are executing consistently on the strategy Noel laid out at CAGNY back in 2019. We are focused on delivering consistent, sustainable, profitable growth, both volume and pricing growth, growth in all of our categories, growth in all of our divisions emerging and developed markets. And this has enabled us to deliver 11 straight quarters with organic sales growth in line with, or above our long-term target of 3% to 5%. This is, despite very difficult comparisons, and a challenging operating environment. The current operating environment is challenging in many different ways. Consumer mobility is limited in many markets, particularly in Asia, due to government restrictions to stop the spread of COVID-19, which is having a negative impact on category growth. These restrictions have also led to temporary closure of manufacturing facilities across many industries as you have heard in the news and from other companies. We are not immune to these restrictions, although given the essential nature of our categories, we produce products that people and their pets use on a daily basis to lead healthier lives.  We have been able to resume production throughout our network, although sometimes at a lower-than-normal level. This did have a slight impact on sales in the third quarter. And we expect a modest impact in the fourth quarter, as we ramp production back up. We are fortunate to have a flexible and resilient global supply chain that has helped us to offset some of the effects of the supply chain challenges, albeit sometimes with additional logistics costs. Speaking of logistics, the stress on global logistics networks is creating shortages of raw materials, lengthening shipment times, increasing costs, and adding additional uncertainty. All of this is on top of the significant increases in raw material costs and continued movement in foreign exchange. These challenges will continue into next year, but we will continue to meet them head on. Our net sales grew 6.5% in the quarter, driven by 4.5% organic sales growth and a 2% benefit from foreign exchange. Our organic sales growth in the third quarter was led by Oral Care, where we were up mid-single digits, and Pet Nutrition, where we were up double digits. We delivered organic sales growth in Homecare despite a difficult comparison, which puts our homecare business at double-digit growth on a two-year stack.  As expected, organic sales in Personal Care declined mid-single digits as we lap the COVID-related growth in liquid hand soap in the year-ago period, but sales remain above 2019 levels. We grew volume 1.5% in the quarter. Pricing grew 3% in the quarter up sequentially from Q2, despite a more difficult 4.5% comparison as we continue to layer in new pricing to try to offset accelerating raw materials costs. Pricing was up in every category and every division. Raw materials continue to increase in Q3, putting further pressure on our gross margins, despite additional pricing and productivity efforts.  Our gross margin was down 180 basis points in the quarter. Pricing was a 110 basis point benefit to gross margin, while raw materials were a 510 basis point headwind, despite a slight benefit from transactional foreign exchange. Productivity was favorable by 220 basis points. On a GAAP and base business basis, our SG&A was up 50 basis points on a percent of sales, driven by significant increase in logistics costs as advertising was up on a dollar basis, but flat on a percent of sales basis. Excluding logistics and advertising, our overheads were down slightly on a dollar basis and down nicely on a percent of sales basis. We continue to increase our investments in capabilities like digital, e-commerce, and data and analytics, but this was more than offset by sales leverage and tight expense controls. For the third quarter on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was down 5% year-over-year, while it was down 3% on a base business basis. Our EPS was down 7% on a GAAP basis, and up 3% on a base business basis. A few comments on our divisional performance. Net sales in North America grew 1% in the third quarter, with organic sales growth of 0.5% and 50 basis points of favorable foreign exchange. Volumes were flat in the quarter, despite a negative nearly 400 basis points impact from lower liquid hand soap volumes.  While pricing was slightly favorable. We made significant progress on our North American business in the quarter with solid Oral Care growth driven by mid-single-digit growth in toothpaste, which led to improved toothpaste market share performance through the quarter. Personal Care and Homecare were both down, as we lapped COVID benefits in the year-ago period although EltaMD and PCA skin delivered strong growth in the quarter. North America operating margins were negatively impacted by raw materials and higher logistics costs. The impact of plant closures on our global supply chain required us to incur additional airfreight charges to fulfill customer orders in the quarter. We also incurred some additional manufacturing costs in the quarter that should help improve the long-term profitability of the division.  Latin America net sales were up 11%, with 8% organic sales growth and a 300 basis point benefit from foreign exchange. All three categories delivered organic sales growth in the quarter, with Oral Care organic sales growth in the high single digits. Volume was plus 2.5% in the quarter, while pricing was up 5.5%. Brazil and Mexico led the growth in the quarter, while Columbia delivered double-digit growth following last quarter's political unrest. The natural segment continues to be a key driver of growth for us across Latin America, particularly Colgate Natural Extracts Charcoal. And we recently launched Colgate Zero Toothpaste in Brazil. Our strong Latin America pricing growth highlights the success of our Revenue Growth Management program with a combination of less price increases, premium innovation, and trade promo adjustments. Europe net sales grew 1% in the quarter, with organic sales minus 1%, and foreign exchange adding 2%. Volume was down 1%, and pricing was flat. Oral Care organic sales grew high single digits, while Personal Care organic sales were down sharply, driven by difficult liquid hand soap comparisons due to COVID-related consumption in the year-ago period and a decline in Florida Duty free sales. Colgate elixir toothpaste continued to drive growth in the quarter, along with strong contributions from Elmex and Meridol. Asia-Pacific net sales grew 1% and organic sales declined 0.5% in the quarter, with volume down slightly and pricing and foreign exchange both slightly positive. Oral Care saw low-single digit organic sales growth in the quarter while Personal care, and Home Care were down due to difficult COVID comparisons. We did see government imposed mobility restrictions negatively impacting category volumes in several markets, including many in Southeast Asia. India and the Colgate China business both delivered strong volume growth behind robust innovation in the ayurvedic segment in India and an e-commerce in China.  Our Hawley & Hazel JV saw significantly improved performance in Q3 versus Q2, with trends also improving sequentially through the quarter. Africa, Eurasia net sales grew 1% in the quarter, with organic -- with an organic sales decline of 1%, lapping double-digit organic growth in the year-ago period, more than offset by a 2% positive impact from foreign exchange. Volumes were minus 4.5%, while pricing was plus 3.5%, The organic sales growth decline in the quarter was driven by personal care as we lapped double-digit growth in the year-ago period due to COVID-related demand and pricing. Oral Care organic sales in the quarter were flat as disruptions in the global supply chain had a negative impact on product availability. Fill strong growth continued in the third quarter with 20% net sales growth and 19% organic sales growth. With strong growth in both emerging and developed markets. Organic sales growth was driven by double-digit volume growth and high single-digit pricing through list price increases and our premiumization strategies. Our focus on the microbiome, which [Indiscernible] talked about during our CAGNY presentation this year, continues to pay dividends with the active biome plus technology. Including in Hill's Prescription Diet gastrointestinal [Indiscernible] and Hill's Science Diet Perfect Digestion Both of which are driving sales growth and share in this important segment. And now for guidance. We still expect organic sales growth for the year to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range. As I mentioned previously, we have seen an impact from government actions to stem the spread of COVID-19, including reduced consumer mobility and supply chain interruptions. We are managing through these issues, but we would expect modest headwinds from this to continue in the fourth quarter. Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low single-digit benefit for the year, others slightly less favorable than when we gave guidance in July. Please note that at current spot rates, foreign exchange will have a negative impact on Q4. All-in, we still expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%. given the continued pressures from raw materials, we are projecting a greater decline in gross margin than when we last gave guidance in July. Fourth quarter gross margin is expected to be roughly in line with the third quarter although the raw material situation remains very difficult. We continue to take additional steps to mitigate the impact of these cost headwinds, including additional pricing, optimizing trade spending, accelerating FTG where available, and many others.  We are focused on recouping the gross margin we have lost due to cost inflation over time, and are planning to take the actions necessary to do so. Advertising is still expected to be up on a dollar basis, but flat on a percent of sales basis. Given the issues surrounding logistics networks on a global basis, our logistics costs will continue to be a headwind, particularly in the U.S. and Africa/Eurasia. Our tax rate is now expected to be between 22% and 23% for the year on both a GAAP and base business basis. On a GAAP basis, we still expect earnings-per-share growth in the low-to-mid single-digits, and as we said on the second quarter call, towards the lower end of that range.  On a base business basis, we continue to expect earnings-per-share growth in the mid-to-high single-digits. Again, we would expect to land at the lower end of that range. And with that, I will turn it over to Noel. Noel Wallace : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. So what I take away from our performance, I guess both in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis, is that we continue to make good progress on our strict strategic and operational journey despite the significant volatility we're encountering across our entire business. At the heart of this is our strategy to deliver broad-based, sustainable, profitable growth. Every division, every category, both volume and pricing, that's our aspiration. And over the past few years, we have changed our mindset about how we drive growth. We're more proactive in attacking the opportunities for growth. Think core, premium [indiscernible] faster alternative channels and markets. And of course, we talked a lot about building capabilities. Think digital, data, e-commerce, innovation. All of these are helping us mine these important areas of growth. While lapping our most difficult comparisons in over a decade, we've delivered organic sales growth at the high end of our long-term target range of 3% to 5%. And on a 2-year basis, both pricing and volume growth increased sequentially in the quarter. Importantly, this growth is being driven by our two most important categories : oral care and pet nutrition. Oral care organic sales were up mid-single-digits in Q3 against the mid-single-digit comparison enter up high single-digits year-to-date. We're driving this growth through more impactful innovation, Sure growth and faster growth channels like e-commerce and pharmacies, and hire more efficient marketing spending. Our premiumization strategy is paying off with our focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation, changing how we interact with the people who use our products. A great example of this is how we've changed our approach to whitening. In U.S, you're familiar with Optic White renewal, which has done incredibly well. Outside the U.S., the story needs to be more about just hydrogen peroxide levels. In China, it's about enzyme-based whitening.  In other markets, we have whitening products targeted towards consumers who had loved tea or coffee, or consumers who love wine or tobacco. We're targeting the whitening opportunity much more broadly with new technologies, formulations, and delivery systems, expanding our growth potential. Pet Nutrition organic sales growth was up 19% in the quarter against an 11% comparison, and is now up 14% year-to-date through quarter 3. This growth is driven by Hill's science-based equity messaging behind our core. It's driven by meaningful premium innovation and the continued expertise of our digital and e-commerce teams.  The launch of Prescription Diet Derm complete those breakthrough therapeutic nutrition for both food and environmental sensitivities has lead to share gains in the category and is being rolled out internationally over the next few quarters. Hills goal of MD pet obesity where study show over 50% of pets are overweight is the impetus for our Hills master brand campaign. This campaign has been rolled out globally, and has driven growth in both our therapeutic, and wellness anti-obesity products. In this type of environment, we couldn't deliver the results without -- this year without the amazing work done by Colgate people every day.  Our customer development organization is reacting quickly to the changing cost environment so we can take pricing as part of the revenue growth management initiative. Marketing in R&D of working together to accelerate the launch of premium innovation to drive mix and profitability. And most importantly, our global supply chain team has delivered these results despite freight and logistics disruptions, plant closures, congested ports, and supplier outages. Importantly, all the efforts we have put into building capabilities over the past few years is not just about driving growth. It's also about creating an organization that can respond more rapidly to all these challenges we face around the world. For example, our focus on data and analytics is helping our Revenue Growth Management Program pinpoint the best opportunities for incremental pricing as costs continue to rise. We are getting this pricing out in the market more quickly and the data that drives this process gives our people on the ground more confidence in their decisions. Our investment in e-commerce and digital marketing continues to pay off. In our six largest e-commerce market for Oral Care, we finished the third quarter with year-to-date net sales already ahead of 22 net sales -- 2020 net sales and toothpaste share growth in five of the six markets. We've implemented new media buying strategy to drive efficiencies both online and offline, and launched a four-tier training program to enable 14,000 of our employees to help drive our digital strategy. But as I've said, the key through all of this is that we recognize that the strategy is working. And while we address the pressing issues of raw materials, logistics, and supply chain, we can't lose sight of our long-term areas of focus. Our innovation calendar for 2022 will show an increase in the percentage of innovation that is breakthrough and transformational. We've announced our new sustainability and social impact strategy this year, Which includes 11 new targets and actions in areas like Zero Waste, climate change, using less plastic, as well as bright smiles, bright futures, and our diversity equity and inclusion efforts. And we will continue to build our people and capabilities through new ways of working that are truly changing how Colgate people do their jobs. 2021 has been very challenging year for us, and many of these challenges will continue in 2022, but I'm confident of the changes the Colgate people put in place over the past several years which will allow us to continue to deliver our goal of sustainable, profitable growth. And now I'll open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. Noel Wallace : Hey, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So, Noel, can you review your Oral Care market share performance globally, maybe compare and contrast some of the regions that are performing better versus laggards? And if you take a step back, looking at the strategies you laid out at CAGNY a few years ago, which strategies have sort of taken hold in Oral Care are working? Maybe what are some of the areas where you might need some more work? And if I can just slip in a related second part, can you also update us on the competitive and the pricing environment in Oral Care in light of the higher cost environment here? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Dara. So overall, we're pleased with the progress that we're making on Oral Care, particularly in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes. If you take our shares on a constant currency basis, they're relatively flat, which is better than where we had then. When you start to go around the world, particularly as you look at new channels, we're very pleased with the progress we're making in e-commerce and pharmacy. So let's just bounce around the world a bit. North America still has been a little bit soft, but we've seen the shares bounce back nicely in the last 13 weeks and where our shares are actually flat now. And all outlet basis if you take e-commerce and all the untracked channels, our estimation is our shares are back to flat and U.S slightly up, which is good progress, particularly as we've seen the acceleration of some of the premium SKUs that we've launched in the market, particularly whitening over the last 13 weeks. And likewise, our e-commerce shares continue to be good, not as good - strong as our general market, but progressing in North America.  Europe, the shares have been strong. Our Elmex and our strategy behind Elmex and Meridol has been very successful in pushing those businesses across all of our core markets. Our shares continue to be up across that region and we continue to see the shift toward our premium bundles, which was again part of the strategy change that we outlined back at CAGNY that we were going to focus on underserved channels like pharmacy with some of our premium therapeutic equities, like Meridol and Elmex. Latin America, the shares continue to be very strong, flat in the quarter, slightly down as a result of some of the promotional volume that we've given up in Mexico, which has been quite significant, but Brazil shares continue to be pretty good and trending nicely, particularly behind strong revenue growth management initiatives that have characterized the Brazilian subsidiary for so long, but overall pretty good.  Africa, pretty good. Good shares in South Africa, better shares in Russia as we move to a premiumization strategy there, so we're pleased with that aspect as well. China has been a terrific performance in the quarter for us, Dara. We've seen our e-commerce shares across both the Hawley & Hazel joint venture as well as the Colgate franchise be the fastest-growing SKUs in the market. We are the fastest-growing manufacturer in the market. Our shares on the Colgate business in China now are up after many years of declines when you combine both brick-and-mortar as well as e-commerce. So overall, very pleased, then again, I think that's a testament to the strategy and the strategic changes we made with our portfolio.  Remember that our big focus in China was getting the premiumization part of the portfolio fixed. The growth in e-commerce has all been premium SKUs, which priced at about 300 index to the general market. So again, I think good innovation at that end of the market is helping to drive our business. And you heard in the upfront comments, obviously, e-commerce across the world, once again is driving a nice shares for us, particularly in Oral Care, where we've had a lot of focus. Coming back to the question around the strategy on Oral Care, again, the focus was premium, innovation and new channels. And if you take our pharmacy growth across the world in toothpaste, very strong, particularly in key markets where we really focused, which have been in Africa, Europe and Latin America, particularly Brazil. You see our pharmacy shares continuing to grow and we've got a good pipeline of innovation coming in 2022 that's going to be specifically tailored towards pharmacy growth. And likewise, e-commerce being the other fast-growth channel and obviously just articulated the success we're having there. Therapeutic was the other big focus that we had in CAGNY in terms of where we're going to push the Oral Care business, particularly toothpaste. We've expanded meridol and elmex strategically in the core markets where we see big pharmacy classes of trade and where we see the therapeutic segment growing. And our success has been quite notable, particularly in those markets, whether you look at Brazil specifically, whether you look at the Middle East, where we've been quite successful as well. So again, I think that strategy seems to be taking hold. Naturals has quite frankly been a little bit soft, and I think that's coming out of the COVID period, where consumers traded to more therapeutic efficacious brand so to speak and the natural segment was softer than we would expect it. So hello, here in North America, shares are stable but not growing as much as we anticipated. We did indicate that we're rolling that out selectively into some core markets around the world. And that will unfold in the balance of this quarter and into the first quarter of next year.  So overall, I think the strategy that we outlined are working certainly as you've seen from the results there, mid-single digits in the quarter and high single on the year for Oral Care, which has been absolutely terrific and consistent, and that is on top of a marketplace that quite frankly is growing considerably below that right now. So again, we think we're driving share globally when you look at it on all outlet basis, particularly given the organic growth sequential improvements that we're seeing. Operator : We'll go next to Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : Hey. Good morning, everyone. I hope you're doing well. So, I was hoping to get your perspective on kind of what you're seeing in the current environment and how that informs your view on the growth trajectory as we look ahead to '22, right? So the top line momentum is strong, and as you mentioned, the inflation and FX headwinds are expected to continue. And I don't expect guidance, but I would just love to get your perspective on how we should think about margin progression looking out beyond Q4. Noel Wallace : Well, listen, Peter. You've heard it, I think throughout the earnings season so far, that obviously, cost inflation is significant for all fast-moving consumer goods. And we're certainly not immune to that. And -- but what we are very good at is pricing, and you've seen that consistently over time and time over the years, whether it's foreign exchange inflation or raw and packing material inflation, we have found ways over time to recover that in our margin line. And that is certainly the focus right now in the business. The good news is when you have an inflationary environment that's indexed around raw materials, you tend to have everyone looking to take pricing in the market, and that makes it more conducive certainly from a category standpoint and making sure that everyone takes pricing that the volume continues to go along with that. So we're pleased that we've seen pricing in the marketplace, we've been leading that across the board, quite frankly, particularly in emerging markets where we've taken pricing quite aggressively throughout the first half and very much into the third quarter and we've laid out pricing for the fourth quarter and into early 2022. So we'll see the margins begin to recover. Now, the environment you've heard around raw materials and logistics continues to be extremely volatile. And we anticipate that we'll continue to see some headwinds in that space. The team understands that and is putting the strategies in to place in order to recover margins as we move forward. We will also be heightening our focus around Revenue Growth Management. That discipline is going to be really embedded much more so given the fact that we've now put some analytical processes in place to help the teams, as I outlined, which we think is terrific. It will give the teams a lot more confidence on the pricing that we're taking to ensure that we're working with our trade partners to grow category at the same time as we take pricing to recover cost, so we're pleased with that.  Likewise, had a lot of discussions over the last couple of months on our grids our new product grids relative to premium innovation, and making sure that we continue to focus on that area of the business, whereas historically we've under-indexed and we've seen good progress against that, particularly, as you look at some of the premium businesses that we have around the world, whether it'd be Elmex, Meridol or some of the prices we've taken on our therapeutic bundles within the Colgate portfolio. So overall, a tough raw material environment will continue to be very choppy but we're very focused in terms of taking pricing and ensuring that we push our premium innovation moving forward. Operator : We'll go next to Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. Could you talk about your supply chain? And I know you mentioned the issues in China, but I think 2 parts to this question : A. What is happening globally? Do you see mostly things sequentially improving, or it's still very tough to service clients and customers globally. And B. I think you said there was an impact in the third quarter and it's going to linger in China in the fourth. I'm assuming this is not material, but just wondering if you can quantify. Thank you. Noel Wallace : [Indiscernible] You've come to know Colgate in the fact that we consider our supply chain a competitive advantage for us and that is the fact that we operate globally with some of the most efficient facilities around the world. And the benefit of that is obviously translated into the strong gross margin progression that we've seen over the years. That being said, when you operated global supply chain, you're not immune to decisions taken in locally that will impact that. And obviously in Asia, where we have seen our government's taking actions to stop the spread of COVID, whether it'd be bad or obviously impacting some of our suppliers and our third-party contractors, we've seen disruption in the supply chain. And as a result of that, we have the contingencies in place to move that production elsewhere, which the team has done just a tremendous job in servicing the sales needs of the business. And you've seen that, obviously, in the acceleration or the continuous good topline growth that we've had.  And that's a function of our supply chain ensuring that we meet the demand of our products and our retailers. And we move production around the world to do that. That comes with a cost that certainly we incurred in the quarter. Some of the disruption specifically related to what we referred to in our commentary, we're moving through those very quickly. We have moved behind one that was quite significant and we're back to where we needed to be in terms of output and we're back to pretty close on some of the other ones.  We expect that to be fully back in capacity by the end of the quarter of this quarter, but that being said, the environment is very unpredictable. And we'll continue to try to anticipate some of these things moving forward as we've done, but one can never be for sure when a government decides to come in, and shut down a province, or an area based on their needs. Likewise, this has a big impact obviously on the rest of the supply chain, whether it'd be raw material sourcing, whether it'd be our contractors.  You heard in John's commentary, we did take some decisions, particularly in North America, around some of the contractors that we use in order to clean that up and move into a supply chain strategy that allows us to exit some of those and get more efficiencies moving forward. We're taking all the right decisions moving through the issues that we had in the third quarter but we are not immune to the unpredictability of the supply chain that environment that everyone's faced with today. Operator : We'll go next to Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yes. Good morning, everyone. No. I was hoping you can talk about -- I was hoping you can talk about pet. It's been a remarkable turnaround over the last few years obviously, improvements in market share but also category growth. So I just wanted to see if you can unpack some of the drivers that you see for the business, and how long do you think that higher pet adoption phenomenon that we've seen during COVID will continue to be an incremental tailwind? Noel Wallace : Sure. Listen, the pet business has been terrific, obviously. I think a lot of the change in strategies that we deployed a couple of years ago, which again are based foundationally on exactly all the stuff we're trying to deploy across the world, really working on the core of our business, looking at premium innovation and continuing to really dial up our focus on high-growth channels. And that's exactly what's unfolded over the last couple of years and that strategy is continuing obviously to get sharper and sharper, as we executed more broadly across the Hills network around the world. A lot of that growth has come out in North America which has been terrific, the double-digit growth compounding each other. U.S. had another outstanding quarter in the third quarter. Again, we're benefiting from a quite buoyant category, but the important part that you called out is we're growing share quite consistently, not only across our wellness products are our core products, but also our therapeutic products and Prescription Diet. We're seeing obviously Vetenerians open back up. That is certainly improving the consumption of our Prescription Diet. We talked at length about the innovation process we had behind Hills, which I think is second to none in the category right now, bringing real science and real therapeutic benefits to pet owners. And we're seeing that translate into obviously more penetration and growing share. We continue to talk about the low awareness of Hills, both in North America and around the world that affords us a significant opportunities We continue to build that brand consistently all over the world and we're continued to invest behind that business. Despite the fact that raw materials are a headwind, we're not going to jeopardize the health of the brand by cutting back on our investment. We will continue to invest to grow awareness And that ultimately is growing penetration in the category, so we feel very good about where we are. Obviously the comparisons continue to get tough, but those have been tough, and we continue to see good progress on the strategy, our ability to take pricing, and our ability to bring in new consumers to the franchise. Operator : So the next to Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Carey : Hi, good morning. Noel Wallace : Morning. Chris Carey : I wanted to get a bit more context in North America. You said that you had incurred some extra manufacturing costs in the quarter. I think you just noted there were efficiencies with contract manufacturers, but the comment was in the prepared remarks, I believe to improve the long-term profitability of that business. And I was wondering if you could just expand on that. Do you think a lack of scale or efficiency or something else in the manufacturing base has been a cause of the margin compression in that business, and if they have opportunities to offset that? Am I reading that wrong? I guess just overall in the context of the pressure on margins and the commentary around some of the actions you're taking above, a bit more perspective. Noel Wallace : Sure. Chris Carey : So thanks so much. Noel Wallace : Sure. Yeah, let me jump into that in a little bit more detail. Obviously, it was somewhat of a perfect storm in the third quarter for us as we looked at the business in North America, significant inflation in raw materials, obviously, that came through in the quarter. Logistics was probably the most significant headwind we had in the last couple of months versus where we were previously. Obviously, you're not -- you're clearly aware of the logistics industry and whatever -- what's going on. Tighter capacity, tighter labor, higher costs obviously, which have obviously fueled significant increases in rates internally within North America, not to mention the fact that there's a lot of congestion going on, and a lot of delays in getting product to and from where it needs to be. As a result, we've been very focused on working with our retailers to ensure that we can continue to improve upon that. The other areas I mentioned earlier, we have this incredibly efficient global supply chain, but we do source product from different parts of the world. And you've seen obviously ocean freight increases -- increase dramatically over the last 3 months or 4 months. We have not been immune to that North America, quite frankly, brings quite a bit of its product from overseas. While we have very substantial manufacturing presence in North America, we do bring product from overseas, which has obviously been a victim of those price increases we've seen in ocean freights. The other one is we have seen increased demand, particularly in some of our Oral Care products and we want to continue to service that as we always have consistently and reliably to our trade partners. And as a result of that, we made decisions to airfreight product in to ensure that we had sufficient supply for our retailers. That airfreight did not come without a significant cost. We will move through that clearly as we move through this year and into next year and so we'll see those costs come out. And as you alluded to in your question, we did take some important strategic decisions on how we look at our network and our supply chain, both from a contractor standpoint, as well as what we source internally within our facilities. And made some decisions in the quarter, that will allow us to rework some of those contracts, and hopefully drive more profitability in the long term. So overall, we're pleased. Good oral care growth, which is obviously where we want to see that business continue to grow.  The business is looking at, obviously, a pricing environment is becoming more conducive to take pricing historically, which has not been the case. And they're very focused on their new product grids around premium innovation, which is a strong plan for 2022 and a resurgence of focus around Revenue Growth Management, given how important it is that we offset some of that compression we're seeing at the margin line. So overall, we were -- a difficult quarter for North America, but they've got the plans in place. And we think some of the things that we were working through in the quarter will be behind us as we move forward into 2022. Operator : And we'll go next to Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, good morning. You guys have such huge market shares in some of your categories in emerging markets. I wondered if you could take a step back and just comment on what you're seeing. I mean, we don't really have a sense for has consumer behavior changed in some of those markets. Is there a lag effect from COVID, either the consumer stockpile our has their free sensitivity changed just in some of your bigger markets. I figured you guys are a good Company to ask about what you're seeing on the ground, you had 3.5% growth in emerging markets on the volume side, which is good but not great. And I'm just wondering if there's something other than just tough comps, if there's a change in the way consumer shop or how much they have to spend from a high-level big picture perspective? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. Let me just address the 3.5% quickly, Wendy. Obviously, that was drawn down by some of the shutdowns we saw across Asia. And the lack of mobility of Southeast Asia, in fact, very little mobility. We saw categories fall off quite dramatically across Southeast Asia and that's certainly had an impact on volume in the quarter. And as you heard John mentioned, if you really want to dimensionalize a lot of the volume softness in the quarter, was liquid hand soap, which was a headwind of 400 basis points in the North America business alone. But let me step back to your broader question on what's going on around the world, coming out of COVID and what we're seeing in terms of category behaviors.  Oral Care was not a COVID beneficiary, and obviously, it was not in the same camp as we saw from some of our personal care businesses which saw significant acceleration in consumption and a more systemic behavior change across the world. Oral care -- as mobility comes back into the market, we continue to see the oral care categories growing, and that's good for us long term, obviously, getting more and more consumers back into stores will allow more consumption, and more category-driven initiatives to take place. And so we think, over the longer term, we are going to see oral care continue to accelerate. Personal care and homecare were obviously quite significant beneficiaries during COVID. While the liquid hand soap has taken a significant drop-off this year, it still remains above the 2019 levels. And as you rightfully said, we're the number 1 liquid hand soap player certainly in North America and around the world. And that we'll see that behavior, at least, stay with the consumer above the '19 levels, but certainly not anywhere close to where they were in 2020. Hygiene products that we're very focused on in our homecare business, Whether it be dish liquids or floor cleaners, I think we'll continue to see nice growth in those categories. You heard John mentioned the Home Care growth that we've seen as more and more consumers stay home. Obviously, there's more dishes being cleaned and more floor being cleaned and that has allowed that category to continue to be quite robust. But as consumers move back and mobility comes back into markets, are people return to work?  You may see a little bit softness in those longer-term, but overall, we think we're positioned well, particularly in the Oral Care space. If you go to pet food, obviously the significant adoptions that we've seen over the last two years during COVID and the fact that we're now executing much, much better against our strategy. We feel very good about where things are moving there. And there has been a behavior change unquestionably in that category, where consumers have returned to science and nutrition, and very focused on that space which we are obviously very driven by right now. Operator : [Indiscernible] with Jefferies. Kevin: Great. Thanks, Good morning, everyone. Question, I want to come back to the pricing strategy and implications on gross margin over the next 12 months. So, specifically with all the pricing that's going into place, you guys have done a fantastic job at funding the growth for decades. My question, is the intention as you sit here today with all the volatility in the environment that you can fully offset the input cost pressure and everything you're dealing with supply chain perspective with pricing and productivity. Is that a realistic ambition? Is that a realistic goal as you're sitting here from a risk management perspective?  Is that something you think you can do, or is the cost, inflation, and supply chain pressures just too great at this point? I'm just trying to get a better understanding of how you guys are thinking about it, how you're pricing, and how you're thinking about productivity. And then if I could just sneak in one related question. A lot of interest around demand elasticity, which has been relatively low, I think, across many categories. just observed and which I understand is going to vary by category, by geography, by channel, just some broader observations there. And Noel, what you're seeing so far with the pricing in place for your business would be helpful. So thank you for all that. Noel Wallace : Sure [indiscernible] you're obviously watch this closely and price is always been a key driver of our organic growth given how we look at the markets around the world and we've consistently look for quick ways to get pricing in the market and not only to drive category growth, but obviously to protect the margin which ultimately allows us to protect the advertising. It's worth mentioning that obviously on a two-year stack that this was the highest pricing number we've seen in many years for us. Again, I think it reflects a consistent discipline we have across the board of taking pricing quickly in the markets.   You heard me talk a little bit about how we're using data and revenue growth management now to get that information on the ground quickly to the teams, so they can do what they need to do to analyze, to take pricing across the board. But it's not just going to be pricing. We will look at, obviously, premium innovation and getting our mix improved, not only within our portfolios, but channel mix as well. I talked a little bit about the importance of driving pharmacy growth around the world, which is a growth opportunity for the Company, particularly in Oral Care. That typically trades with a much better margin for the Company given the therapeutic profile of those bundles.  We're obviously going to continue to embed significant revenue growth management initiatives all over the world not just in some of the key inflationary markets. And as we talked about earlier, we're deploying some pretty nice strategies around the emerging markets right now to ensure that we get pricing up beyond just list prices. The other piece of this is productivity. Historically, you've seen us do a really good job around funding the growth. This quarter was no exception, adding 220 basis points to the margin line. But we're really dialing that up, not just simply from a cost standpoint, but really looking at efficiencies across the organization. And going into 2022, looking at how we look to find optimized ways to run our business more efficiently, And we'll continue to do that as we historically have done, and find ways to pull costs out of the system. John mentioned it in his commentary, our overheads were actually down very nicely in the quarter on a percent of sales. And again, I think that's part of the cost focus that we have. And looking at our business and making sure that we're finding ways to optimize. So it's going to be a multitude of different things. And we'll continue to see that evolve. It will take some time to be sure. These things don't move in a straight line. We're taking pricing where we can, as quickly as we can. We're obviously watching the competitiveness of the market. But as I mentioned earlier, this is an environment that everyone is facing right now, which tends to allow everyone to find ways to take pricing up in the category.  So we don't feel we will be in an anti-competitive position, but we will be very close to watch that market to ensure that we continue to remain competitive. The other piece of this -- we haven't really mentioned is the advertising. And we continue to focus on being -- building our brands and being competitive in the marketplace. And that is a key driver of the consistent topline growth you're seeing in the Company right now. And we'll continue to do everything we can to protect that advertising line, and obviously working through the middle of the P&L will be critical in that regard. Operator : For the next [indiscernible] Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey folks, good morning. I guess I want to pick up on Mr. Graham's question around margin progression, but zooming in a bit more just in North America. And if we step back, I know it's a tough year with cost and logistics, etc. But if we step back and just look over the last 5 years, year on track to lost 1300, 1400 basis points of profit margins in North America. I think you're also on track to actually have market share lower than you were five-years ago over that duration.  So Noel can you just give us some context around what's happening with the investment plan in North America with tech and lose strategy there. And do you think you've got the right investment posture, the right innovation plan to compete effectively in the market? Is this just a low point on margins? Can we bounce back from here as a slick during point just any context you can give us around the profitability in the performance in that market. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Jason. So we talked about Oral Care, obviously a big focus for us in the North American business. That was strong again in the quarter up mid single-digits. I won't repeat what I talked about in terms of share growth, particularly last 13 weeks. We are more competitive in the U.S. market. We were not competitive in the first half. We've dialed up our competitiveness and we're seeing the benefits of that translate into better share progression, particularly across some of our premium bundles. We continue to support the business quite well. We think we're in a good place where we need to be, but obviously as any marketer would say, more support is always better. We're looking for increased efficiencies in that business as we move forward in order to accelerate gross margins. As I mentioned earlier, North America was disproportionately hit with raw material, inflation, logistics, and we took decisions very deliberately in the quarter to address demand that obviously had an effect in that quarter. So we anticipate that we'll start to come out as we move through the fourth quarter and certainly as we move into the first half of 2022. That being said, the raw material environment continues to be very volatile and unpredictable. And we'll take the decisions that we need to take to remain competitive. We are very focused on growing the North America business. It is a priority for the Company. We are ensuring that we give them what they need in order to address the challenges and the competitiveness of that marketplace, and we expect that we'll continue to see good gross margin expansion over time. I do think this is a low for us, but I say that in the context of an environment that's quite unpredictable. But given what we saw go through in the third quarter, we anticipate that things will get better as we move forward. Operator : Next to Kamil Jagrulla with Credit Suisse. Kamil Jagrulla : Thank you, good morning everybody. I'll follow-up a little bit on the second question on price elasticity. And maybe just linked to price elasticity if you could also just maybe comment on the consumer condition, various areas around -- around the world. Noel Wallace : Sure. Listen, we've historically led pricing in so many of our markets. And in the emerging markets, you tend to see a little bit more elasticity early on, but we are focused on ensuring that our innovation process is across multiple price tiers. And so when you combine pricing with innovation at the same time, we find that we can rebuild consumption quite quickly. Elasticity tends to dissipate over time certainly as we get the new innovation in the market and communicate that. So we're quite confident in where we are in emerging markets. Developed markets tend to be a little bit more difficult. Historically taking pricing in Europe and North America has been a challenge. We have certainly shifted a lot of our focus to now relaunching brands, relaunching the core, bringing more premium innovation in the market in order to drive pricing and typically then as you bring value-added consumer oriented benefits to the category, you can take pricing and therefore the elasticity is in its dramatics. So we will see it over time. I think there is everyone is raising pricing fundamentally in the categories that we compete in. That tends to reduce the elasticity as well. One might ask, where Is private label in this environment? Private label shares were down in every single category in which we compete fundamentally so the news is, big brands are winning and I think as long as you bring good quality innovation, you continue to support that innovation with good content that's personalized and targeted, we think we can offset some of the elasticity. But that being said, the raw material environment is significant and pricing will be significant over the next few quarters in order to offset that moving forward But we want to do that to make sure we protect our advertising line. Operator : The next to Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Hey, thanks, and good morning. Noel -- Noel Wallace : Hey, Steve. Steve Powers : -- I guess maybe to summarize a lot of what we've talked about so far and just try to cut through the -- some of the noise around manufacturing, closings, and mobility restrictions, and bottle supply chain, bottlenecks, etc. I guess I'm trying to get a better sense for how you're seeing Colgate's momentum trending, particularly on the oral home and personal care businesses. As I look at it, I think I see directional improvements. They are evident this quarter, sequentially, but at the same time, in most regions, I think overall performance came in lighter than many of us had hoped on the outside. So again, can you maybe just summarize the sequential momentum as you see it on a global basis, maybe how you expect things to progress in fourth quarter X Hill's, and what the early setup is heading into the new fiscal year in terms of building that momentum further r? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes, Steve. We're very pleased with momentum. I mentioned in my comments, up sequentially or 2-year stack on volume and pricing in this environment, we think is a terrific result driven by our core focus areas, which is Oral Care and Pet Nutrition. Oral Care continues to drive good sequential growth quarter-to-quarter, we talked about at mid singles in the quarter, high singles on the year. Obviously, the pet nutrition business in double-digits, comping double-digit. So again, I think some terrific progress there. Personal care significantly impacted by COVID driven categories.  And liquid hand soap, which is a very big business for us in North America and around the world, obviously, we saw a significant fall-off in the category. The category was down 28%, to give you some context on that, and as John mentioned, that was a 400 basis point headwind. So some of the COVID categories were certainly stabilized as we moved forward and we lap those moving into 2022. But the essence of your question is, where are we with the momentum on Oil-Chem? We feel good about it. We feel good about our 22 plans. We feel good about the pricing we're taking. We feel good about the segments we're competing in. We feel good about the channel strategy that we've had where we're growing share in the fastest growth channels which are typically e-commerce discounters and pharmacy. And the strategies that were put in place in the portfolio execution of that is delivering against it. So we feel, overall, we're pleased with the underlying momentum on Oral Care, Personal Care as we lapped some of the COVID will improve moving forward. We had some good discussions particularly in North America and Europe around some of the innovation that we need to continue to drive it.  Our market share, interesting now, just as a data point on market share on liquid hand soap in the U.S. was actually up two points in the quarter given the fact that it was still down 400 basis points versus where it was last year on a volume standpoint. So again, we think we're taking the right decisions on portfolio and innovation in order to drive share and continue to recover some of the softness that we saw that was temporarily driven by the COVID expansion last year. Operator : We'll go next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Noel Wallace : Hi, Lauren. I think you're on mute. Operator : At this time there is no response so next to Brian Moynihan with Bank of America. Brian Moynihan : Hi, good morning and thank you for taking the question. Noel Wallace : Hi, Brian. Brian Moynihan : I wanted to ask just a question around free cash flow and want to understand if -- with the inflation and just all of the noise, I guess, in supply chain, if it's having an effect at all on free cash conversion? And I ask because last year, you over-delivered relative to the 90% conversion target. Looks like this year, at least year-to-date, running a little bit below that. And so really just wanted to understand if there's -- if the effect that it's having on the P&L is also having an effect on free cash flow, and if that's something we should consider as we're looking into '22? Noel Wallace : Yes, I'll throw this to understand. But let me just provide a couple of topline comments. Overall, if you go back historically where we are, it compares quite consistently with our historical numbers, that there were some benefits that we certainly had last year on a comp basis around working capital, but let me turn it over to Stan. Will give you a little bit more color on that, Stan? Stanley Sutula : Yes. Thanks. We continue to cycle favorable working capital performance versus last year and there's really an anomaly when you look at 2020. First of all, 2020 cash flow, driven by the unique environment, was up significantly. While we're down year-to-year, I think if you look back and compare to '18 and ' 19, you'll see that it's more in -- more in line. Higher raw materials pricing certainly put upward pressure on our inventories. But I think important to note as you mentioned, free cash flow, as you'll see the investment we're making in the business and capex. So capex up roughly a $120 million, that's really an investment, as Noel talked about earlier, in the long-term help our business and what we're looking to grow. So that investment has an impact on free cash flow. But we think, it's incredibly important for the long term. So you step back and look at cash flow where we are today. We're not concerned about the positioning. We think we are confident in our ability to generate that cash. We're confident in our ability to invest in the future of the Company through capex, so we're comfortable with the current positioning on free cash flow. Noel Wallace : Yeah, I would only add that particularly around capex which has been quite consistent for us over the years, We found -- we see ourselves with some real opportunities to invest in growth areas of the business. And that's certainly what is elevated the capex in the quarter which we think only good news for the long term. Operator : We'll go next to Javier Escalante with Evercore. Javier Escalante : Hi, good morning, everyone. And another question on pricing, so basically we heard from both your competitors, Proctor and Unilever taking pricing either in Q3 or announcing price increases, but if you could talk about the big local players that China, in India, is there something in the supply chain that is different that they can drag on pricing? Is this a concern? And this is something that contributed to the weakness in Q3 both in China and India, that will be very helpful. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure, Javier. Thanks. I think the answer is everyone is -- no one is immune to the inflation that we're seeing across the market, both from a raw material standpoint or from a logistics standpoint. Obviously, they may have had different constituents. They look at their business differently than public companies or big multinational companies. But in any case, no one is immune to it. And XIVE had discussions and been able to get out and travel a bit and talk to retailers. I mean, retailers are recognizing even on their own private label brands, they are going to have to take pricing to offset the significant inflation that's being absorbed in the market right now. So I expect that you'll see all boats rise, so to speak. In this environment, that pricing will go up. There will be certainly some delay with local players as they tend to try to search out a bit more volume as the big players take pricing. But again, I think if you can combine the pricing with the right innovation, which we're very focused on delivering, and adding value to the consumer, the local brands have to react to that in some form or fashion, either with their own innovation or with their own price increases in order to stay competitive from a support standpoint. So I don't anticipate it's going to be a significant issue, Javier, you know, our business. It's really well, you know, that we innovate across all price points and we have significant focus. It's very deliberate in markets, and looking at shares, and our innovation process across each of the key price segments that we compete in. And that will certainly be the case as we move forward. Operator : To Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Thanks and good morning, everybody. Wanted to ask just specifically on the ad spend. Are you guys getting the right returns on the absolute dollars that you're spending? If you take a look at that category, that column, the increase is somewhere north of 200 basis points over the last few years as a percentage of sales. Obviously, there's a lot of discussions on the call talking about market share challenges, Oral Care, household prior to the pandemic. Just maybe holistically kind of talk about how you think about that. Does that number needs to move higher from here? Can it stay the same, but can you kind of work in a different way? And then how does that all kind of tie into market share and profitable growth for the business going forward. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Well, listen. Let's step back and look at what's happened over the last two years. And I think it's very clear that we have re-accelerated the topline of the Company. And that has been a core focus for everyone in the organization. It's just growth mindset that talks about elevating our core, our adjancencies, and faster growth channels and doing that across all categories and all geographies. And if you take a basis of two years ago, that's exactly what we were delivering against right now. The investment we believe is fueling that growth. Obviously the strategies, and the execution are big part of it, but we feel very strongly that the acceleration that we've had in investment, both on the oral care side, as well as the nutrition side, have clearly delivered top-line growth. Now we would like to see it reflected in some of the Nielsen based share readings. But the market is very complex now. The go-to-market strategies in the path to purchase for consumers is much more complex than it ever was in the past, and consumers moving between channels, and obviously the emergence of our [Indiscernible] which is quite significant. And in some markets like China has become a very significant part of the category. And we're seeing very strong [Indiscernible] there. Overall, we feel the top-lines moving in the right direction. The investment is supporting that. That being said, we are very focused on making sure that we deliver ROI against every dollar in the P&L. And we have brought in resources from the outside and amplified our capacity around the world, working with WPP, our partner, to get much more granular and much more analytical about how we're investing, particularly our digital spend to make sure it's targeted and we're getting ROI for that spend and we're getting much, much better at that. So as we look at our advertising, will continue to be competitive in terms of what's needed in the marketplace, continue to ensure the health of our brands are protected. But we're very focused from a productivity and efficiency's standpoint looking at that bucket as spend, and making it work harder for us. And that's exactly what we'll expect to see in 2022 as well. Operator : Our last question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Noel Wallace : Hey, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : So, can you hear me this time? Noel Wallace : Yes, I can. We can hear you just fine. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, cool, because I don't what happened. I just was curious about Mexico, which is it was kind of called out in the context of Latin America and shares being a little softer. So I just wanted a little bit of detail on that. Thanks so much. I know this has gone on for a long time. Noel Wallace : No. Mexico, again, high single-digit performance in the quarter. And obviously a difficult environment, particularly given the aggressive pricing that we've been taking in the marketplace. And that pricing certainly had a little bit of impact on volume shares in the quarter. But nothing that's terribly concerning to us. It's what we consider not real profitable volume, given that we're losing to the lower end of the market. Some of our competitors have been highly aggressive with their promotional -- there promotional levels and we've decided to protect the margin in the P&L, and continue to invest in building the brand. Interesting if you look at some of our equity measures in that marketplace, particularly given that we focus now on really supporting the equity as well as innovation. I was -- attended their budget review just recently and they look terrific. Again, I think -- we feel like we've got a very strong position in that market. We sacrificed a little bit of the promotional share, but that is not unusual when we take pricing and lead the market and will continue to ramp up innovation and ensure that we remain competitive, but nothing to be concerned of. Brazil, likewise, which you didn't ask about, but I'll mention that shares are flat there and doing very, very well, particularly as we see great growth in the pharmacy channel. So the balance of our portfolio has gotten much more therapeutic, which is obviously more profitable for us in the long term. So we're pleased with some of our 2 big markets. And you heard John mentioned Colombia is back on track given the political disruptions we saw last quarter and driving some nice growth for us. Across Latin America, good. Not concerned about Mexico at this point. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. And this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to today\u2019s Colgate-Palmolive Company Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John. John Faucher : Thanks, Orlando. Good morning, and welcome to our 2021 full year and fourth quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. I will provide commentary on our full year and Q4 performance as well as our outlook for 2022 before turning it over to Noel for his comments. We will then open it up for Q&A. We delivered solid results in 2021 despite a very challenging operating environment, which we believe provides further proof that our strategy is working. For the full year, we grew net sales 6%, adding nearly $1 billion in revenue. We grew organic sales 4.5% at the higher end of our 3% to 5% 2021 guidance range despite difficult comparisons. Importantly, our organic sales growth this year was led by our two most important categories : Oral Care, which delivered organic sales growth at the high end of mid single-digits; and Pet Nutrition, which delivered organic sales growth in the teens, our second consecutive year with double-digit organic sales growth for Hill\u2019s. Both of these categories saw an acceleration in organic sales growth in 2021, which we think bodes well for 2022. Personal Care and Home Care organic sales growth were both down in the year as they lapped very difficult comparisons driven by COVID-related demand, but we anticipate both categories will return to growth in 2022. But on a compounded basis, over the past three years, we have delivered organic sales growth across every division and every category with growth in both volume and price. And we are confident that our growth will continue into 2022. Our innovation pipeline is strong as we continue to shift our focus to more breakthrough and transformational innovation. We have raised our level of brand support, including increased advertising spending that is driving improved brand equity. Our digital transformation is paying off with e-commerce market shares growing in key markets and strong e-commerce sales growth across all of our categories, including Pet Nutrition and within Personal Care, premium skin. That said, the operating environment remains volatile, with COVID still very much impacting our business, unprecedented raw material inflation and supply chain disruptions. As Noel will discuss, we believe our 2022 plans and our long-term strategic choices will allow us to continue to grow and improve our profitability as we move through the year. This includes significant pricing, increased advertising, breakthrough and transformational innovation and stepped up productivity. Our net sales grew 2% in the quarter, driven by 3% organic sales growth and a 1% negative impact from foreign exchange. Our organic sales growth in the fourth quarter was driven by Pet Nutrition and Oral Care, while Personal Care was down slightly and Home Care was flat due to COVID-19 comparisons. Organic sales growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by the factory closures related to COVID-19 lockdowns we mentioned on the third quarter call. As you have seen across many companies and industries, raw material pressure worsened in the fourth quarter, putting further pressure on our gross margins. Our gross margin was down 300 basis points in the quarter on both a GAAP and Base Business basis. Pricing was a 120 basis point benefit to gross margin, while raw materials were a 670 basis point headwind. Productivity was favorable by 250 basis points. On a GAAP and Base Business basis, our SG&A was down 150 basis points on a percent of sales basis, driven by lower advertising spending, lapping record levels in the year ago quarter as well as lower overheads, excluding logistics. Our combination of net sales growth and productivity drove our overheads, excluding logistics, down meaningfully, which helped us offset a large increase in logistics costs both on a dollar basis and a percent of sales basis. For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, we delivered earnings per share of $0.18. Our GAAP earnings per share, includes a $518 million after-tax charge for impairment on our Filorga Skin Health business. We completed the Filorga transaction right before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has had a significant impact on key channels in which Filorga competes, including travel retail and Duty Free in China and pharmacies in Europe. While we have been unable to offset the continued weakness in these channels versus our projections when we announced the acquisition, we have full confidence in the Filorga brand and are forecasting double-digit growth going forward. Our two other skin health brands, PCA Skin and EltaMD, are performing well and should continue to deliver strong growth. On a Base Business basis, our earnings per share was $0.79 for the quarter, up 3%. Our full year Base Business earnings per share was within our 2021 guidance range of up mid to high single digits. In order to accelerate changes to our operating structure that will allow us to reallocate resources to our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses and channels, drive efficiencies in the company\u2019s operations and streamline our supply chain to reduce structural costs. This morning, we also announced the global productivity initiative. We intend to execute the majority of the productivity program in the current calendar year. And once the projects are implemented and finalized, it is expected to result in cumulative pre-tax charges totaling between $200 million and $240 million in annualized pre-tax savings in the range of $90 million to $110 million. We would expect the benefits to begin to flow through in the second half of 2022 and then accelerate into 2023. We returned $3 billion to shareholders in 2021 with our net share repurchase up almost 50% year-over-year. A few comments on our divisional performance. North America net sales declined 1% in the fourth quarter, with organic sales down 1.5% as the division lapped high single-digit growth in the year ago period, with liquid hand soap providing a greater than 3 percentage point headwind in the quarter. In toothpaste, our consumption was ahead of shipments, as our all-outlet market share was up 50 basis points in the quarter. We have announced significant pricing across all of our categories in North America, which will be implemented throughout Q1 and into Q2. Latin America net sales were up 3.5%, with 6% organic sales growth. Oral Care grew high single digits, while Personal Care and Home Care grew mid single digits. Brazil led the growth in the quarter behind strong pricing and premium innovation across whitening and naturals. Europe net sales declined 6% in the quarter, with organic sales minus 3.5%, lapping 4.5% growth in the year ago quarter and a 2.5% foreign exchange headwind. While the pricing environment in Europe is normally very difficult, we expect to see pricing across the portfolio. We gained market share in Europe in Q4, with particular strength behind Elmex and we have significant innovation planned for 2022. Asia-Pacific net sales grew 0.5% and organic sales grew 1.5% in the quarter, with volume and pricing up slightly and a modest negative impact from foreign exchange. Our Asia e-commerce business continued its strong growth in Q4 and for the year. We gained nearly 400 basis points of toothpaste market share in e-commerce in China in 2021, combined on our Colgate and H&H businesses. Africa/Eurasia net sales grew 2% in the quarter, as organic sales growth of 3% was partially offset by negative foreign exchange. The organic sales growth was driven by Oral Care despite impacts from the supply chain disruption from COVID-19 restrictions I mentioned previously. Volumes were also negatively impacted by political volatility in Eurasia. Hill\u2019s finished another great year with a strong fourth quarter. Net sales grew 12% and organic sales grew 13% for the quarter. The U.S. continued to lead Hill\u2019s growth performance, with strength across the gamut of brick-and-mortar and e-commerce retail partners. We expect another strong year for Hill\u2019s in 2022, with strong levels of advertising support, best-in-class e-commerce execution, innovation and pricing growth.  And now for guidance, we expect organic sales growth for the year to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range, driven primarily by continued growth in Oral Care and Pet Nutrition. Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low single-digit headwind to revenues, operating profit and earnings growth for the year. All-in, we expect net sales to be up 1% to 4%. We expect gross margin to be up for the year, but we highlight that, just as we saw in 2021, there will be significant swings in year-over-year performance as we go through the year. The biggest raw material headwinds year-over-year are in the first quarter and we expect that they will moderate as we go through the year. On top of the productivity program I mentioned above, we will continue to take additional steps to mitigate the impact of logistics and raw material cost headwinds, including additional pricing, optimizing trade spending, accelerating FTG were available and many others. Advertising is expected to be up on both a dollar basis and a percent of sales basis. Given the issues surrounding logistics networks on a global basis, our logistics costs will continue to be a headwind, particularly in the U.S. and Africa/Eurasia. Our tax rate is expected to be between 23% and 24% for 2022 on both a GAAP and Base Business basis. At this point, we have not incorporated any proposed changes to U.S. corporate tax rates. We expect double-digit earnings per share growth on a GAAP basis. On a Base Business basis, we expect earnings per share growth in the low to mid single-digits. There are a few factors that will determine where we fall in that range. We have budgeted modest sequential declines in some raw material prices as we go through the year. If those raw materials stay at current levels, this will be above what we are currently budgeting. Foreign exchange. The dollar has been trending higher recently. If that continues, it will be an additional headwind. We assume that raw materials and logistics cost increases are not unique to us and our plans do not include significant manufacturing downtime due to COVID-related lockdowns. And with that, I will turn it over to Noel. Noel Wallace : Thanks, John and good morning everyone. Before I get into my remarks, I want to wish all of you a safe and happy new year. Of course, I will be speaking to you all again just a few weeks for CAGNY and I am very much looking forward to that. Over the last 3 years, we have revitalized our core businesses, innovative and adjacent categories and expanded our availability in faster growth markets and channels. All these efforts have helped us deliver 3 straight years of organic sales growth in or above our long-term targeted range of 3% to 5%. I believe our company is well-positioned to continue our momentum and drive shareholder value in this year and beyond despite the difficult operating environment. We compete in growing categories with high purchase frequency, daily usage and high levels of brand loyalty and we have strong brands that are well-positioned to take advantage of these category dynamics. Colgate is the most penetrated consumer brand in the world, with strength across emerging and developed markets. Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet and Hill\u2019s Science Diet have strong health credentials with vets and pet parents. Elmex and Meridol are leading premium brands and therapeutics in the markets in which they compete. And other brands like Irish Spring, Protex, Suavitel and Fabuloso, all delivered tremendous value to consumers and our retail partners. This also includes our skin health businesses, EltaMD, PCA Skin and Filorga. John discussed the impact of COVID-19 on Filorga, which resulted in performance below our targets. We have plans in place to revitalize our Filorga business in those key channels, along with building out distribution and other growth channels and accelerating innovation. We are confident that Filorga will be a strong contributor to future top and bottom line growth. Trends on EltaMD and PCA Skin remained very strong. We have and are building capabilities that will allow us to compete in all types of markets and channels. Our global operating model, including our supply chain, allows us to operate effectively and profitably in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. Our transition to our new innovation strategy has enabled us to deliver a better mixture of global and local innovation, including increased levels of breakthrough and transformational innovation. This has had a direct impact on accelerating our growth, particularly in Oral Care, our rebound in China e-commerce, for example and accelerated growth in Pet Nutrition. Our digital transformation, which will be an important topic when we present to you at CAGNY, has allowed us to accelerate our e-commerce efforts across all of our markets. We delivered another year of robust e-commerce growth and grew share in all 6 of our largest e-commerce toothpaste markets in 2021. And we are truly integrating ESG into our business strategy in ways that drive value. Bright Smiles, Bright Futures not only teaches children in underserved markets how to brush their teeth, but also help drive per capita consumption over time. And our recyclable toothpaste 2, which we shared the technology with our competitors, is helping to drive the entire category to be more sustainable, which is a requirement for any category to deliver growth in the future. We also issued our first sustainability bond in the fourth quarter. We will use the funds to invest in our sustainability and social impact strategies while benefiting from a lower interest rate. So, I firmly believe we are well positioned to deliver long-term sustainable profitable growth to our shareholders and all of our stakeholders. But we also need to balance managing through the teeth of a very difficult operating environment while still delivering on that long-term strategy. We stay committed to our strategy. We will emerge from the next few quarters with sustained organic sales growth and a structurally more efficient company that will allow us to grow profits, while still investing in our brands. Obviously, you all know about the headwinds that companies are facing in today\u2019s operating environment in terms of raw materials. COVID and higher costs are putting significant pressure on supply chains, including unprecedented impacts on logistics, both in terms of efficiency and costs. And recently, the dollar has strengthened. The key for us to deliver against our targets in the shorter term is to continue to execute on pricing and revenue growth management. We have already taken pricing in many markets and we will have further significant pricing plan for the first half of this year, including moving some pricing that we anticipated for later in the year in 2022 into the first half. You all know our funding the growth is well-ingrained and a key component of offsetting rising raw material costs. We have put together new cross-functional teams that are focused on ensuring we are bringing additional opportunities to our funding the growth and that we are executing them as rapidly as possible. So, we are accelerating short-term actions to drive improved profitability, but we know the key to shareholder value creation is to remain committed to the long-term. To that end, we will continue to invest in brand building. As I said a few minutes ago, it all starts with strong brands. We have turned our growth trajectory around over the past few years and a key component of this has been additional advertising spend. Our guidance for 2022 includes an increase in advertising to make sure we are able to sustain volume growth as we exit a period of very strong pricing. At CAGNY, you will hear even more about how we have increased the return on marketing spend through our digital transformation. We will continue to focus on innovation, providing added value to our consumers through innovation that supports increased pricing. Our innovation pipeline is very strong for the year and heading into next. We have innovation across our categories with a particular focus on premium innovation that brings new benefits and forms to our brands. We are also investing in capacity. Our CapEx rose in 2021, primarily because we are investing in incremental capacity for growth, along with investments to advance our sustainability efforts. Our need to build capacity across the business, mostly in Pet Nutrition, shows that the rebound in organic sales growth is real and when we expect to continue. This investment won\u2019t preclude us from continuing to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And finally today, we announced a productivity initiative that is focused on aligning our costs and investments with our long-term strategies. This program is designed to deliver savings that can both be reinvested for growth and apply to the bottom line. Importantly, this program, along with the pricing and funding the growth, should allow us to exit this inflationary cycle with more levers to drive growth and profitability and keep our strategy on track. So, 2022 will be another volatile year with all the headwinds you heard me described, but we intend to execute to deliver growth and drive shareholder value, all with delivering against our long-term strategies, which makes me very excited about the future for our company. And with that, I will open it up to your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Good morning, guys. Noel Wallace : Good morning, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So I was just hoping for an update on the Oral Care business. The full year is often a good time to take stock of where you stand. So can you discuss your market share performance in Oral Care in 2021? Trends as you progress through the year, probably most productive to talk about it on a regional basis? But as we look forward, Noel after the strategic changes under your leadership the last few years, are you satisfied with where you stand? And how do you think that business is positioned for 2022? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Dara. So as you heard in some of the prepared comments, Oral Care accelerated in 2021. In fact, it was double the growth rate that we had in 2020. Our consumption exceeded shipments in most markets, and that was a function of some of the supply chain challenges that we incurred, particularly here in North America as well as in Asia. So if I walk around the world, really strong back half performance in Europe. In fact, we\u2019re at record shares on the toothpaste business exiting the fourth quarter there. You heard John mentioned the strong growth we\u2019re seeing in China, which was obviously a key market for us to get turned around in the last couple of years. Our e-commerce shares are up very, very strongly. They are close to 400 basis points and the fastest consumer brand in the market. Our brick-and-mortar shares are holding. So overall, we\u2019re delivering share growth there. Latin America Holding, as we talked about, we\u2019ve been very much on driving revenue growth management in those markets and have some great success, particularly in markets like Brazil. And we\u2019re trying to resist just chasing some of the promotional volume at the lower end of the market, which has lost some of our volume share. But overall, we feel very good about where we are, particularly around the premiumization. North America, while we exited strong, we\u2019re still not satisfied with the performance there. Clearly, we believe we have significant opportunities there. The innovation plans we have in place for 2022 reflect our commitment to that market as well as the increased advertising support, particularly around the premiumization strategy and we expect to see shares rebuild nicely in 2022. But satisfied at least that the fourth quarter and some of the back half activities that we put in place to be more competitive, have certainly stabilized the share, and now it\u2019s about growing. As we mentioned, some of our untracked channels continue to perform very well in Oral Care, in the U.S., particularly the club channel as well as e-commerce. We don\u2019t talk a lot about toothbrushes, but that business had a really good year for our share growth is up in toothpaste \u2013 excuse me, in toothbrushes across most markets, and some good innovation likewise coming on that. That will be coupled obviously with strong pricing. I\u2019m sure we will get into a lot of discussion on that, but we have taken pricing in emerging markets. We are rolling aggressive pricing in developed markets, and that will continue to bolster share and our ability to support the brand moving forward. So overall, we\u2019re pleased with Oral Care, Dara. Operator : And our next question will come from Peter Grom with UBS. Please go ahead. Peter Grom : Hey, good morning, guys. Noel Wallace : Hi, Peter. Peter Grom : So I just wanted to ask around the guidance for gross margin expansion, just in the context of what we\u2019re seeing right now. Can you maybe help us understand some of the underlying drivers behind that? And I know John mentioned it embeds some moderation in raw material costs. So could you maybe provide more detail there or maybe where you expect that moderation? And then maybe just more broadly, like how should we think about the phasing of gross margin expansion? And ultimately, how that impacts earnings cadence as we move through the year? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. So let \u2013 I guess to start with raw materials there. Obviously, we saw a significant acceleration in raw material prices following the first quarter in 2021. That continued to escalate as we went through the year. And certainly, based on where we thought we were in the third quarter, we saw significant increases moving into the fourth quarter. In fact, resins up more or less 50%, our tablet price is up 30% to 40% in the fourth quarter. So all of that is now built into how we\u2019re thinking about \u201822, and we expect raw materials, quite frankly, to peak in the first quarter. We have developed our plans based on spot rates today, and we expect the spot rates to hold and begin to moderate towards the back half of 2022. So you see raw materials potentially peak in the first quarter and then stabilize and begin to potentially moderate in the back half. You layer on top of that our pricing strategies for the year. We took some pricing in the fourth quarter in emerging markets. We took more pricing in the developed markets in the first quarter, which will mostly take effect as we exit the first quarter into second quarter. We\u2019ve got, obviously, the additional productivity programs that we talked about this morning, that will be very back half weighted more in the end of the third quarter, early fourth quarter and into \u201823. So we won\u2019t see much benefit this year, particularly in the first half. So \u2013 and you combine that likewise with an innovation plan that is weighted more towards the premium side, particularly in North America in the first quarter. And all of that will help us lead to growing margins as we go through the year and exiting the year with margins up. Operator : And our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. Good morning. Noel Wallace : Hi, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Hey, I was curious if you could talk a little bit more about the restructuring, because I feel like it\u2019s rare to see a program that only 1 year in nature. So kind of are these projects or programs that would have been on the to-do list, but were accelerated? Are they opportunities that you proactively sought out and look for ways to accelerate what would typically be funding the growth because of the environment? And then also, I feel like in the last 12-plus months, there have been a couple of things that have come up regionally with sort of operating surprises, whether it\u2019s a supply chain hiccup in one market or another. So to what degree also does this program may be look at factors that impacted some of that less consistent operating performance that you\u2019ve had over the last year or so? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Lauren. I think the key word you use is really trying to be proactive. I mean we came into this year after the first quarter, noticing, obviously, an environment that was becoming more challenging, particularly around COVID and disruptions associated with that as it then obviously led into a significant inflationary environment and we got out ahead of this as quickly as we could to start thinking about our 2025 strategy and ultimately, what we were trying to achieve and how we wanted to accelerate. We\u2019ve seen a lot of great progress in our digital transformation. We\u2019ve seen a lot of great progress as we\u2019ve restructured our innovation groups around the world towards breakthrough and transformational innovation and the benefits we\u2019re seeing coming out of that. And we decided we really wanted to accelerate that transformation and make sure that we get that savings into the business as quickly as possible as well as the benefits of how we structure ourselves to be more agile and faster to market, the benefits we get out of increased resources in the digital space as well as the innovation. Now bear in mind, as you heard from John, we had a really good year around controlling our overheads, and we have been constantly looking at ways to mitigate the inflationary pricing we\u2019re seeing in the market. Our overheads were down on the year, down considerably in the fourth quarter. And I think that\u2019s just good business. We\u2019re constantly looking for ways to optimize how we operate. On top of that, we want to look at how we structure ourselves to really continue to accelerate the growth momentum that we have. So as we move throughout the year, we will exit this program. As you said, it\u2019s a one-year program with the savings really falling into the back half of 2022 and into the first half of \u201823. It allowed us to really fine-tune where we wanted to focus and allowed us to do that in the 12-month period, and we think that\u2019s ultimately right for the business to ensure that we don\u2019t have ongoing distractions across the organization, and we get on with trying to accomplish what we\u2019ve set out to do for the year and into \u201823. On the regional point that you were mentioning, Lauren, listen, as you\u2019ve heard from everyone, the supply chain challenges everyone faces are quite significant. And it really, to a certain extent, depends on the structure and composition of your supply chain. We have had, as you know, one of the most efficient supply chains in the world in terms of how we\u2019ve optimized our global sourcing all around the world and how we put capital into ensuring that we have extremely low-cost plants. We will benefit from that long-term to be sure. In the short-term, given some of the disruptions that we\u2019ve seen both in Asia as well as here in North America, we\u2019ve had to deal with that. And that has brought some additional costs and obviously, as you heard, some disruption to the top line of the business as well, likewise, no question into the market share. So we\u2019re moving to get through those as we go into \u201822, and we feel very confident in where we are with our supply chain and the changes that we\u2019re making, particularly in the productivity initiative to continue to optimize that moving forward. Operator : And up next, we will hear from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Thanks very much and good morning. Noel Wallace : Good morning, Steve. Steve Powers : Maybe \u2013 Good morning. So maybe rounding out Dara\u2019s initial question. Just could you talk a little bit about how Oral Care performed globally in the fourth quarter from an organic growth perspective? And then looking ahead, I guess I\u2019m wondering if you can provide just some more detail around the composition of the 3% to 5% growth you\u2019ve called for \u201822 both by product segment, Oral Care versus Pet and presumably some normalization in Home and Personal Care, but also by price versus volume because obviously, you\u2019re putting in a lot of price. So I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s going to be mostly price-led. But I guess I was a little surprised in the quarter to see Latin American volumes dipped negative in response to the sequential acceleration in price there. So just curious as to how \u2013 you\u2019re thinking about that and thinking about elasticity as \u201822 progresses? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. So let me talk a little bit about Oral Care. Obviously, in the prepared remarks, you saw that the fourth quarter was driven by Oral Care and Pet Nutrition. So overall, quite pleased. And that was despite some disruptions that we saw in the quarter. The shutdowns that we talked about in the third quarter had a more material impact in the fourth quarter. That was about 60 basis points of growth to the total company in the fourth quarter, and all of that would have been in Oral Care, so to speak. So we\u2019re moving behind those. We see a little bit more disruption in the first quarter but we have a pretty good line of sight that by the second quarter and throughout the balance of the year, we will be back to where we need to get to be on that. So overall, Oral Care was good. I mentioned the strong exiting the market shares in Europe, which were very, very strong. We stabilized the shares in North America and actually saw some all outlet growth in the fourth quarter, driven by untracked channels, which was terrific. And we\u2019re particularly pleased with the reception to our new products in 2022 that we\u2019ve introduced as well as the acceptance of the pricing across North America. So we\u2019re quite confident in terms of where we\u2019re \u2013 how we\u2019re setting ourselves up for continued growth in \u201822. You had a question on price volume, and I\u2019ll address the Latin America question within that. Obviously, there is going to be more price in our organic growth in \u201822 versus volume given the significant increases that we\u2019re taking across the world. And as I mentioned, we began taking pricing at the end of the fourth quarter. We have implemented and announced pricing across the emerging markets here in the first quarter, which will take effect, as I mentioned earlier, in the early part of the second quarter. But no question, given the size of the pricing that we\u2019re taking around the world, and you\u2019re seeing that from ourselves as well as competitors in other categories, you will see a falloff in volume. And we\u2019re accustomed to that. Relative to how we think about our promotional cadence and how we think about our innovation plans as well to ensure that we continue to build volume through the balance of the year. So the makeup of the organic growth this year, no question will be driven more by price than by volume, which is a little bit different than what we\u2019ve seen in historical years. I\u2019ll say that all boats rise in this environment in the sense that everyone is impacted by the inflationary environment. So as a result, you\u2019re going to see pricing up pretty consistently across all categories. That plays, as you\u2019ve heard from others, into elasticity that you\u2019re not seeing one competitor move, you\u2019re seeing the category move. So elasticity tends to be a little bit less. We will see. It\u2019s early days now. But our experience, as you well know, Steve, of taking pricing quite significantly to offset foreign exchange in markets around the world. We have been able to balance that elasticity impact with good innovation and good promotional cadence, understanding how to ensure we\u2019re innovating across the price tiers and making sure that we\u2019re protecting the consumer and the category growth at the same time. Latin America had a really strong quarter. Bear in mind, they had a strong comp that they were dealing with. So the 2-year stack looks terrific. I think it was about 16%, if I remember correctly and obviously, 6% on top of 11% a year ago and largely driven by pricing. So, a little bit soft in the volume line as we took some pricing but we fully expect that that will recover itself. Categories continue to be quite healthy in Latin America, mid single-digit growth and the consumer seems to be responding to at least in the short-term, but we will watch that carefully as we move through \u201822. Operator : And up next, we will take a question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. I guess you mentioned consumption has been greater than shipments. Can you update us on the service level in the U.S., where I understand that you\u2019re still reviewing inventory? And you mentioned that in the fourth \u2013 the first quarter is still going to be impacted by that \u2013 by some of the disruptions. So can you elaborate on that? And then on the Latin American comment that you answered to achieve just now, I was just wondering if \u2013 when you think about the volume shortfall, is it coming from mostly from Oral Care or is it coming from Home Care or even some of the Personal Care items that were \u2013 that had a lot of strong demand last year? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Andrea, let me take your second question first because I think, to a certain extent, it addresses some of the earlier commentary on the quarter. Bear in mind that we had strong growth in Oral Care and Pet Nutrition. We were lapping significant category growth in Personal Care and Home Care that obviously paralleled our growth last year, given some of the impacts of COVID. Liquid hand soap, as a category in \u201821 was down roughly 25%. Likewise, you saw that level of growth as a category in the fourth quarter as well. Some of our home products \u2013 our cleaning products were down 15% to 20% as a category as well. So no question that had an impact in the quarter. But we\u2019ve seen that kind of starting to stabilize and our sense is as we move into \u201822, those categories have hopefully bottomed out relative to consumption. John mentioned that we shipped above \u2013 consumption was above shipments, and that was due to a certain extent to the continued constraints around logistics, the challenge of getting trailers not only around the country, but across borders, either from Mexico or otherwise. Some of the challenges that we had and the shutdowns and plants across Asia that we mentioned earlier, that obviously had an impact on the North America number as well. But as I said, we\u2019re moving through those. We think we will be out of that by the end of the quarter. We\u2019re taking the necessary steps, as I mentioned earlier, to ensure that our supply chain continues to operate as efficiently as possible. We will make a couple of changes relative to sourcing. That has obviously created a little headwind in terms of cost. But overall, we feel good about at least the plan in place, to address some of the short-term issues that we face. We will see the benefit of that as we refill the pipeline to a certain extent moving through the back half of the year. Operator : And next, we will take a question from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hi, good morning. Question, I suppose, on inflation\u2019s impact on the consumer. Most of what we\u2019ve heard so far, particularly in developed markets as we haven\u2019t seen a lot of impact. I guess you guys have probably a better sense than most given how much inflation you\u2019ve dealt with around the world and how this is likely to unfold. So if you could just talk about maybe the state of the consumer today where you expect it to be in developed markets as it relates to how they might be impacted by inflation? Noel Wallace : Yes, thanks. Early days. Obviously, as you mentioned, we\u2019ve had a lot of experience taking quite significant price increases around the world, particularly as we went through periods of significant foreign exchange headwinds. As I mentioned earlier, I think the big difference here is that the price increases are coming across the entire market in all categories. And as a result, you tend to see a little less elasticity when that happens. But we\u2019re very prepared for that. As I mentioned earlier, very cognizant of our promotional cadence in terms of how to balance that, very cognizant of our need to bring value to our innovations to ensure that the pricing is executed successfully. But we feel pretty good about at least what we\u2019ve seen in early days again, relative to elasticity, time will tell. But my sense is we will be able to weather this quite well given the whole market is moving, and we have a strong innovation and promotional strategy in place to continue to ensure the consumer is valued. Operator : Up next, we will take a question from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Chris Carey : Hi, good morning. Can you just expand a bit on the pricing actions in North America? I know it\u2019s been asked, but perhaps in the context of the margin for the business in the quarter, obviously remains under pressure. And maybe loop into there how the productivity program for 2022 can potentially help that business. Do you think that with pricing coming with productivity coming with expectations around inflation getting a little bit better in the back half of the year that, that division from a margin standpoint can also improve along with the organic sales as some of the comps that have normalized and pricing builds? Noel Wallace : Sure. So, we announced pricing in some of our Personal Care categories late last year, which took effect in the middle of this quarter. The balance of our categories have been announced and will take effect as we move into the second quarter. So, that\u2019s clearly the cadence that we see relative to pricing. Funding the growth relative to the North American business is typically pretty directional across every quarter. As I mentioned, we have mobilized specific teams in North America and in other regions to accelerate some of our funding the growth initiatives. Bear in mind that as we are dealing with the challenges around the supply chain that we want to ensure that we are finding time dedicated time to deliver funding the growth. When we produce against the demand that we have, we obviously don\u2019t want to shut our lines down to test funding the growth initiatives so we are finding alternative ways to do that. On top of that, as you mentioned, the productivity initiative, which will be a global initiative, will impact across more regions. There is not one specific region that we are targeting specifically on that. All the regions will be contributing based on the opportunities that we have identified. So, you will see pricing move through in the second quarter, funding the growth consistent across the year. And we believe quite confident that margins will begin to accelerate as we move into the back half of \u201822. Operator : Our next question will come from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English : Hey, good morning folks. Thanks. Noel Wallace : Hi Jason. Jason English : Congrats on your success as you are accelerating Oral Care and delivering another rock solid year in Pet Care. Based on results and what we see in the market and where we hear you spend your time and energy on calls like this, it feels like you may be neglecting the Palmolive side of the Colgate-Palmolive business. Well, P&G is out there clearly spending a lot on advertising, they are innovating a lot and they seem to be executing quite well. First, do you think I am being too harsh here, or do you see some truth in this? And second, and I guess either way, can you share some of your initiatives and investments you have got planned for this business this year? And how they may compare or contrast to what you have been doing in the last couple of years? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Jason. So listen, we had, obviously, really strong performance in \u201821 \u2013 excuse me, in \u201820 across our liquid hand soap, our Personal Care categories, which include Palmolive overseas as well as our Home Care categories here in North America. Obviously, that \u2013 those categories, as I mentioned earlier, are falling off quite significantly, but we believe have stabilized and will provide more continuity as we move forward. We had some challenges, obviously, getting some of the innovation executed what we wanted to do. Obviously, that\u2019s had a short-term impact. But we feel very good about the plans we have in place in terms of not only getting the pricing through the category, but making sure that we continue to deliver an entrepreneurial approach to these businesses because we have isolated pockets of strength, North America being one, Latin America being another, where we find the opportunities on the ground that we can execute against. So overall, we feel good about it. We know some of our competitors are spending significant money in these categories. As we talked about earlier, we have increased advertising in the \u201822 plan. That will support all of our key priorities mainly Oral Care as well as Hill\u2019s, but we will look selectively in some of our core markets to ensure that we have competitive spending levels to address some of the softness that we saw this year coming out of a very robust 2020. Operator : Up next, we will take a question from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. I have a follow-up question on pricing. Two areas, please. On the elasticities, which I think Steve spoke to and then on pricing ladder specifically. So, number one, on elasticities, just to drill down a little bit because I think the general view would be that the elasticities have been better than expected, at least so far. So, if we do see a mean reversion on elasticities, could that represent downside potentially to your outlook, or have you already sort of reflected that? So, I think additional commentary there would be helpful. And then also to an earlier question, just on the state of consumer. My question is on sort of your pricing ladders, I guess at this point and the potential for consumer trade down to mid-tier value brands or even private label. Have you included some elements of that or not really and that\u2019s just something that the company will have to react to and could potentially result in some negative mix implications whether this is around lower-priced brands or additional promo, etcetera? So, just maybe drilling down on those two areas would be helpful. Thank you for that. Noel Wallace : Sure, Kevin. So again, let\u2019s talk to pricing elasticity. It\u2019s early days right now, as I mentioned. But we expect that we will not see as much pricing elasticity in our business, specifically our own business, as we have seen in the past, given that everyone is taking pricing, it seems pretty consistently across all of our categories and across the world. Time will tell on that, clearly. The elasticity assumptions that we built into the P&L are quite conservative. I mean we wanted to be very careful there to ensure that we were able to adjust and have enough flex in the P&L based on how we saw the consumers react. So, my sense is we are covered there, but we shall watch this carefully to ensure that our assumptions are accurate. And we will pivot as necessary as we see what\u2019s happening in the marketplace. As I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s not only just taking pricing, it\u2019s how we go about executing that in the market relative to our promotional cadence, relative to our new product cadence. And that really fits into the second part of your question, which is the pricing ladder. One of the aspects of our business that we feel very good about is how we have clear distinction at price tiers and value add across the multiple price tiers in which we compete. And we have innovation planned across all those price tiers. Innovation that will not only get us pricing, but brings value add to the consumer should there be any temptation to trade down, particularly in the premium side of the business. But the important piece there is that we are looking to innovate across all of our price tiers to ensure that we continue to bring value to those consumers as they address obviously, a significant headwind around inflation in their markets. Operator : We will now hear from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Please go ahead. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. I wanted to go back and revisit the productivity initiative a little bit. Kind of just taking a bigger step back, I know obviously, when you came in as CEO, there was a little bit of a margin reset as you decided you needed to reinvest in the business, and that\u2019s worked really well because the top line has come in for the last few years in line with your goals. But we have seen margins under pressure, and I know there is COVID and currency and obviously commodities and logistics and all of that. But just kind of longer term, I guess my question is, how do you feel about the kind of 22%, 23% operating margin level for the company? Is that the right level? How much of the global productivity initiative savings this year are going to be reinvested versus drop to the bottom line? And give us the margin expansion and kind of all related to that, and I am sorry for the long question, again, back to Laurence\u2019s point, it\u2019s really unusual for us to see just a 1-year initiative. And I think that\u2019s probably good news because it\u2019s not that disruptive to the organization. But bad news if you have to have multiple of these. And so I am wondering, is this really just a one-off, or do you sort of say, \u201cOh, we might have more in \u201823. We might have more in \u201824.\u201d Just a little bit more color to sort of say, what\u2019s the goal here? Is this margin expansion, or is this cost of business has gone up and we just need to keep reinvesting? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Wendy. It\u2019s kind of all of the above. But let me take a step back for a moment. Obviously, we came out of a pretty significant restructuring program that ended in 2019, the better part of 5 years to 6 years of that. And as we have obviously started to think about our 2025 strategic plan, it\u2019s only good business to continue to look for ways to optimize. We have made a lot of changes in the organization around our structure around innovation, our digital transformation, our back-office centers, how we are thinking about SAP S/4HANA, how we are thinking about our manufacturing footprint and our manufacturing strategy moving forward. All of those are the right things to do to continue to drive efficiency across the business and ensure that we continue to execute against our strategies. So, this is a very focused program. We believe \u2013 I mean it was in response to what we needed to deliver for our 2025 plan to get ahead of this even faster. I mentioned earlier, our overhead structure is pretty well managed right now. You saw overheads down, our fixed costs down in 2021. You saw them down quite considerably in the fourth quarter. That bodes well for us as we move into \u201822, but we need to continue to optimize and reallocate resources into the key growth priorities we have across the company. And you have seen some of those growth priorities. Obviously, the advertising piece has been a key driver of our top line sustained momentum. And our intention, as we laid out in \u201822, is to accelerate that advertising, not only across Oral Care and Pet Nutrition business, but our skin health and some of the other categories that I mentioned earlier in the discussion. So again, we intend to reinvest most of this money, but we want to have levers available to us as we go through the year. We brought Stan in. A big purpose of bringing Stan in was not only his technology background to help us with our transformation, but to help us think about where we can optimize our structure going forward. So, why don\u2019t I turn it over to Stan, and let him share a couple of his thoughts on this. Stan Sutula : Wendy, first of all, thanks for the question. As we look at gross profit, last year, certainly a great year benefited from COVID-driven categories. But where we landed in 2021 on a full year, I think it\u2019s important for a little bit of context, that\u2019s equal to where we were pre-pandemic. So, it hasn\u2019t fallen off from those levels. There is obviously a big mix impact from the categories that drive that. But this productivity program will help us accelerate our actions through our 2025 strategy. We think they are in the right places. Again, there will be timing here, these will start to benefit us in the back half of the year. And on annualized rate, $90 million to $110 million is a meaningful number. Now behind that, on the split of what goes to the bottom line versus what goes back into the business, we have some flexibility there. But part of this is going to get invested back into the business. As we have said, we want to continue to drive the long-term health of these categories and the long-term health of the business. So, the margin as we went through the year, obviously, wrapped on a very difficult compare, but we are confident in our ability to drive margin expansion in 2022. Noel Wallace : Thanks Wendy. Operator : Up next, we will take a question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Thanks and good morning everyone. I wanted to follow up on that question. Can you hear me? Noel Wallace : Yes, I can. Go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Sorry. So, I wanted to follow-up on that question and just think about it on a longer-term basis. What is the right level of EBIT margin for the business over time? If you take a look, over the last decade, it\u2019s roughly flat, I guess the puts and takes on input costs, FX, etcetera. But in absolute, investors expected to increase over time, given what you said about increasing investment. There is less balanced growth, especially if you look this year with pet driving majority of growth. You cut ad spend in the fourth quarter as an example. And obviously, we see increasing competition coming from standalone consumer healthcare companies like GSK and J&J. So, just conceptually, how do we think about this, or how do you think about it? If we look out to your 2025 targets, obviously, not having specific targets there, but can EBIT margins grow over time? And how should we all think about that? Noel Wallace : Yes. Listen, ultimately, our goal is to continue to drive EBIT margins up. And if you think about what we are trying to execute and what we have executed over the last couple of years, notwithstanding obviously some of the setbacks related to COVID, it\u2019s accelerating our priority categories. It\u2019s the Oral Care acceleration. We will grow EBIT margins over time. Accelerating Pet Care, Premium Pet Nutrition, likewise. The Skin Health businesses, we continue to be very committed to those. All margin accretive to the bottom line of the company. So obviously, driving an improved mix in getting those three categories continuing to drive the top line of the company will ultimately deliver more EBIT margin. But we have to be proactive. I mean we are proactive in taking, obviously, the pricing we just discussed. We have to be proactive in ensuring that we have the resources internally to optimize our media spend. We will talk a little bit about that at CAGNY, some of the great work that we are doing around driving ROI more efficiently across our advertising spend. Now that may allow us to spend more against some of the opportunities we see or optimize our spending as we move forward. Likewise, as we talked about earlier \u2013 most of the call today is the pricing aspect of this. And we will continue to be bold and ambitious with our pricing because we believe getting the gross margin in the P&L, ultimately, the EBIT up is the way to continue to fuel the investment that we need to sustain the top line growth. So ultimately, the goal is to drive EBIT margins. Obviously, some challenges in the short-term that we have seen. But we think as we execute against our 2025 strategy, the category that we compete in today, the pricing, the innovation that we have in place, all will contribute to that. The program that we announced is all part of that, obviously, looking at ways to optimize our structure to ensure that we find ways to improve the profitability through the income statement. Operator : And our last question today comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. First, just a couple of follow-ups and then my real question. So, just on the U.S. Oral Care business, can you talk \u2013 can you dimensionalize kind of what the gap was between shipments and retail? And what that impact was maybe as a percentage? And then I guess related, maybe give us a sense of how much the U.S. Oral Care market grew in 2021? And then can you also may be put a little finer point on terms of the magnitude of the U.S. pricing that you are putting in. A lot of adjectives around it, but are we talking mid-single digit, healthy mid-single digit, high-single digit, double digit, just kind of a little bit of sense on that. So, those are just the follow-ups. And then the real question is really can you go into China a little bit. We haven\u2019t talked about that much today. In prior calls, there was some discussion of some disruptions that happened in some of the distribution tiers. I would love to understand a little bit how that developed in the quarter. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Okay. Thanks, Rob and good morning. Listen, on the pricing, I can\u2019t be really any more specific than what I provided you earlier. Obviously, we have announced pricing in some categories in the fourth quarter in North America. We are taking the bulk of our categories were announced and will be effective in the second quarter and consistent with where we see inflation and our needs to continue to grow gross margins that really dictates the level of pricing that we take and where we think we can take it with list prices, and how we do it through our revenue growth management initiatives and how do we do it through our innovation strategy. So, it\u2019s a well thought through approach to ensuring that we are getting the right pricing across the price tiers, able to drive value to the consumer through our innovation, and making sure that we balance that with our promotional cadence. And ultimately, we will see we have \u2013 we do the opposite kind of visibility to where our competitors are taking pricing. We do this in isolation. And we do it based on what we think is right for our business. And we adjust accordingly, moving forward. On China specifically, great success in China, in fact and I think we are still in the early days of that. We saw the Colgate business respond really nicely to a very distinct change in our strategy in that market, not only our go-to-market approach, but more importantly, our innovation approach to really go after the premium side of the market. In e-commerce, e-commerce is now 25% to 30% of the category. And we are the fastest growing brand in e-commerce right now. And that is all at a index of about 2.5x to the market average. So, it really is premium innovation that\u2019s driving our success there. We have got more work to do. We have got some opportunities in the brick-and-mortar environment. We have seen that share stabilize. And so the incremental growth has mainly come through online. And we see as we think about our distribution model moving forward some ways to optimize that. We are taking an important step with our Hawley & Hazel brand in 2022 with Hawley. We have got good innovation and good support levels for that business, to continue to accelerate that. So, we feel pretty good about China. Now, China obviously, the category has been quite sluggish. I mean the brick-and-mortar category was actually down, whereas e-commerce was up. This was really driven by the lack of mobility in the marketplace that we have seen over the last year and the lockdowns that we have seen across that market in different provinces. And that has certainly had an impact on consumption. So, things have slowed a bit. But I think as we move into \u201822 and knock on wood that COVID continues to moderate. We will see obviously, that category rebound nicely and where we believe in a much stronger position to capitalize on that and we were before. Operator : And that\u2019s all the questions we have in the queue. I will turn the conference back to the speakers for additional or closing remarks. Noel Wallace : Well, thanks everyone. So, let me close by extending my deepest gratitude to all the Colgate people that are listening today and those that aren\u2019t their resilience and their care and managing through just an extraordinary environment in 2021, which was obviously continue to be disrupted by the challenges of COVID are nothing, but impressive. For staying so focused on the innovation, our revenue growth management initiatives, as well as the brand building plans had accelerated and sustained top line growth for the company and continued to deliver strong results, so my gratitude and appreciation to all the Colgate people and thanks everyone. I will see you at CAGNY. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John. John Faucher : Thanks, Cristina. Good morning and welcome to our 2022 first quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures including those identified in Tables 5 and 6 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with his thoughts on our Q1 results and our 2022 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. Noel? Noel Wallace : Thanks, John and good morning to all of you. Given the release of the prepared commentary earlier this morning, I will keep my remarks fairly short as I am certain you have a number of questions. Obviously, 2022 is shaping up as a more difficult year than we anticipated with greater-than-expected increases in raw materials as you have seen from others, particularly fats and oils and logistics. This is offsetting what we think will be a very solid year for organic sales growth now that we are seeing our global supply chain stabilize following COVID-related lockdowns and stress in logistic networks around the world [Technical Difficulty] sales growth for the balance of the year. First off, we knew that Q1 will be the most difficult quarter given comparisons, supply chain issues and pricing negotiations. We exited the quarter with high single-digit pricing as we took more pricing in developed markets starting in February and continuing into April. We believe this is more indicative of the pricing we will see for the balance of the year. Elasticity seemed to be either in line or better than expectations and this should help limit incremental volume weakness from the higher pricing over the balance of the year. Encouragingly, as we said in our prepared remarks, volume and organic sales performance improved in February and March versus January and organic sales growth has continued to accelerate in April. Importantly, we are beginning to see the benefits of the stabilization in our global supply chain network with the impacts of COVID-related factory closures behind us and the opening of the global logistic capacities. Our guidance does not assume further COVID-related lockdowns in the balance of the year that would impact our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. Our U.S. on-shelf availability for toothpaste has been below normal for several months as we dealt with the same supply chain challenges you have heard about from other companies. By tapping into our global supply chain, we were able to restore shipments and our availability is now back to normal levels, which you are seeing reflected in better market share performance in toothpaste. And with the improved share performance in manual toothbrushes in the U.S., where our share is up 4.5 points year-to-date, we feel better about the trajectory of U.S. oral care. Combined with increased advertising through the balance of the year, significant innovation, particularly around whitening in the U.S. and in Asia and the relaunch of two important core brands, our Hawley & Hazel brand in China and the Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet business, we feel confident in our forecast for an acceleration in organic sales growth for the balance of the year. This gets us to our new guidance of 4% to 6% organic sales growth. Tempering this outlook obviously is the difficult cost environment. Our entire cost factor has risen over the past few months, but the biggest impact has come in the area that we call fats and oils. That\u2019s palm oil, palm krona oil, soybean oil, tallow and others. This has historically been our second biggest area of raw material spend behind coal new resins. Although given the inflation we are seeing this year, our spending in the second half on fats and oils will equal our spending on resins. These ingredients are used in every category we compete in and we expect a more than 60% increase across fats and oils this year. And while you know our global supply chain is a strategic advantage, the global nature of our supply chain is adding to costs in the current environment. Freight rates from Mexico to the U.S. are up 30% year-over-year and ocean freights have basically doubled. We continued to take significant steps to offset these headwinds. We are taking additional pricing and we are launching premium innovation. We established our 2022 global productivity initiative to drive further cost savings for this year and next year while accelerating our Funding the Growth initiatives. We have reduced our overhead ex-logistics spending by $30 million in the quarter versus the first quarter last year already. So, as we open it up for your questions, we know we need to execute on during the balance of the year and we are very focused against that. While we know our guidance is below our previous expectations, we believe that our cost forecasts are prudent and that our plans are well thought through and well supported to deliver on our organic sales growth guidance, while leaving us well positioned as we look to return to profitable growth. Thanks. And I will be happy to take your questions now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. So just a two-part question on guidance. Noel, when you have this large external change in terms of higher costs, clearly, it requires a change in the level of guidance that we have today, but it also requires a change in sort of choices around the P&L in terms of pricing, levels of investment, productivity, etcetera. So a), just short-term with the new guidance, you quantified very well in the prepared remarks, the cost changes. Obviously, the org sales change. But can you just be a bit more specific on maybe some of the other drivers in terms of incremental price you are expecting with the new guidance for 2022, how you think about incremental productivity? Will it change ad spends at all? I am just \u2013 and part of the reason I ask it is you have got $650 million in higher costs, so that\u2019s a high-teens earnings impact. That\u2019s sort of doubled the earnings revision in the guidance. So I am just trying to better understand the offsets, just some of the cost pressures? And then b), just wanted to really extend that same question more strategically longer term. You have obviously had success reaccelerating organic sales growth to some extent with the changes under your leadership. Do these sort of P&L decisions this year \u2013 how might, if at all, it impact the strategies you put in place or sort of the long-term top line growth trajectory as you look beyond this year? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Dara. Let me start a little bit about the pricing comment, because I think it\u2019s obviously core to how we are thinking about the balance of the year. As you know, we took pricing in at least the developed markets a little late in the quarter. As we had talked about in the fourth quarter, we have planned to take pricing in February, March and April and that\u2019s exactly what happened. So, we didn\u2019t get the benefits of the pricing in the first quarter P&L, largely in North America as well as Europe, while we were able to get significant pricing across the developing part of the world, it was North America and Europe, which lagged a little bit in the quarter. As we exited the quarter, we saw high single-digit pricing being executed, particularly in the March month and obviously, that has continued to transpire as we look at the strong sales that we are seeing in April. We have likewise continued to accelerate pricing in the developing part of the world in the year to go. So, a combination of what we are doing in the developed world and the execution of those prices, which was lagged a little bit, particularly in Europe as we were going through some longer negotiations than we anticipated as we entered the quarter \u2013 and we have consequently taken more pricing in the rest of the world, we feel very good about where we are for pricing and March being more indicative of the type of pricing that you will see in the balance of the year. So, so far so good, particularly around elasticities, volumes are more or less in line with where we thought. But it\u2019s early days on elasticity. We will see how that unfolds in the balance of the year. But we obviously have, we believe a very strong innovation plan, very strong promotional plan as well. So, on pricing, which I think is core to our guidance, we feel pretty good based on what we have seen in March, as I said, where we see it in April and more importantly, the plans that we have put in place for the balance of the year. Strategically, in terms of choices no big changes there. I mean, we have a really strong growth plans. We have talked about going into the year on premium innovation as well as core innovation. You heard a little bit of that in my comments, two significant launches on core innovation. That\u2019s our Hawley & Hazel business, which is the number one brand in China that is a complete portfolio change across the entire business. That was obviously some of the softness we saw in volume in the first quarter was driven by the fact that we were transitioning into an entirely new bundle across the entire portfolio. And likewise, on our prescription diet business, which you know we have had great success on the science diet, we are now taking a lot of those learnings into improved nutrition, improved packaging and conceptual execution on the Prescription Diet business, which is at a premium price. I would also say that on some of our other core businesses around the world, particularly given the pricing environment that we are faced with, we are now in a much better place to execute re-launches given we have more \u2013 a better line of sight on our supply chain issues that we were faced with. That was obviously taking time away from putting new products in the market \u2013 so strategically, when we start thinking about how that lays out for this year and next, we will get back to a lot of those core re-launches, which will allow us to take pricing obviously bolster volume and value at the same time. So that\u2019s kind of where we are strategically, making the right choices, we think about getting pricing in the market, making sure we execute against our very strong innovation plan and protect the core businesses, which will be very, very important as we move into a potential recessionary environment. Operator : We will go to our next question from Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : Hey, good morning everyone. I hope you are doing well. So, I just wanted to ask about the organic revenue outlook. Noel, I know you mentioned the sequential improvement in February and March and into April. Can you maybe unpack that a little bit? How much stronger was the growth versus what you saw in January? And then just for the high single-digit pricing that we should expect through the balance of the year, is the volume assumption in the 4% to 6% organic revenue outlook predicated on historical elasticities or what you are seeing in the market today? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. So, let me deconstruct a little bit of Q1. January was a little softer than we anticipated. As I mentioned, we obviously saw a little softness in Europe given some of the delayed pricing negotiations. We saw little softness in our Hawley & Hazel business as we mentioned, that\u2019s really transitory as we are moving from the old bundle to a new bundle. We saw little softness in our French business and we saw a little softness in the rural areas in India. So that led to a somewhat soft January. Sequentially, we saw all that improve in February and March, both volumes improved February, March versus January. And as I mentioned, we had strong pricing starting to get executed early March and towards the end of the month and into April. So, we feel quite good about where we ended the quarter. And as I mentioned, we have seen that translate into a strong April as well. So, that\u2019s kind of how we have set up the guidance for the year. So, 4% in the first quarter, we believe will be the low end of organic for the year and that will sequentially grow as we move more pricing into the P&L as well as continue to innovate and provide some volume enhancements as we move through the balance of the year. I will say that again, getting the supply chain constraints behind us from a ball point, yes, it cost us money relative to doing some of the things that we did to get more toothpaste on the shelf to get more toothbrushes in the market. We have seen that translate into more volume in the business as a result as well. And that\u2019s a good thing because we are seeing it translate into consumption and category growth for our retailers. So from an organic standpoint, you will see it sequentially grow through the quarters, particularly as we execute more pricing in the second quarter. And as I mentioned, we have now looked to take more pricing in the back half as we will see the peak in raw materials come through later in the year. Relative to the pricing aspect, I think not much more to add there. We have taken \u2013 we took strong pricing in developing part of the world. You see our 2-year stack on pricing at roughly 10%. And there is more pricing to come. And you will see pricing as a percentage of our organic growth likely accelerate certainly in the second and third quarters. And we will see where we end up in what situation we are in, in the fourth quarter, but pricing will accelerate. That\u2019s a combination of a couple of things. Obviously, the revenue management initiatives that we have been taking \u2013 we are getting more premium innovation and I won\u2019t get into some of the success we are having behind the Optic White Pro Series, which is our most premium-priced whitening bundle that\u2019s doing quite well out of the box. We are obviously, as I mentioned earlier, importantly using our supply chain now to get core re-launches executed quicker, which will give us a pricing opportunity as well. So, those would be the three key initiatives relative to getting pricing up in the back half. Operator : We will go to our next question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to perhaps focus on North America and talk about home care, which was obviously a headwind as you called out. And Noel, you just pointed out that some of the new franchises and the premiumization efforts have been bearing fruit. So, I was wondering how we should be thinking in the balance of the year? And just as a prior question regarding elasticities, how we should be thinking it looks as if, as you said, like you have a stacked 10% pricing. I am assuming that is U.S. So, how can we be thinking as you rollover more pricing? Just a fine point there, is that pricing coming in at the end of the summer into the fall or actually earlier than that in the U.S.? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Andrea. Good morning. Let me talk a little bit about home care. So again, a little bit of the constraints that we had with contractors and the implications of certainly the COVID-related issues that have challenged a lot of the contract manufacturing in the U.S. that certainly plagued us a bit on some of our home care, particularly our dish liquid business. And we have specifically addressed that and starting to see the improvements of that as we move through the balance of the first quarter and as we moved into April as well. So, we see home care from a volume standpoint starting to come back nicely. We are taking pricing on some of that home care business in the second quarter as well. And so that will obviously translate into improved performance. Overall, the cleaner business is solid. The fabric softener business is quite solid from a share standpoint, a little softness in dish liquid and we have plans on particularly the Palmolive and Ajax business in the U.S. from a combination of both pricing and some new product initiatives to hopefully bolster that business as we move through the back half. On elasticities, again, it\u2019s really early days here. And I think you have seen it consistently across most of the sector. Everyone is assuming that elasticities will be better than historical numbers. Why? It\u2019s because everyone is consistently taking up pricing \u2013 so therefore, everything is going to be up and we are everyday or products that consumers use everyday. And so, as a result of that aspect, I think you will see a little bit less and less elasticities than we have seen in the past and that\u2019s what we have seen so far. But again, there is a couple of factors to take into consideration. There will be significant inflation across the entire consumer segment and we will be watching that very closely. But if you go back historically, our franchise and our portfolio positioning plays well in inflationary environments, because we have big core businesses, widespread distribution and we compete across multiple price points. But we know that we can continue to grow the premium segment of the market, which is where we under-index, high indexes in the core business, but we are going to take ambitious plans on our core business to bring value to the category and to our retailers. So we feel pretty good about where the elasticities will ultimately end up here just because we\u2019ve experienced it before. We\u2019ve got good innovation going into the market. And as I said, kind of all ships are rising in this case to the categories are all taking pricing across the board. Operator : We will go next to Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy, your line is open please check your mute button. Wendy Nicholson : Can you hear me? Noel Wallace : We can, Wendy. Wendy Nicholson : Okay, sorry about that. So just a follow-up on that line of questioning about the elasticities. If I look back in my model, the one business that really suffered during the \u2013 great recession for you was the Hill\u2019s business. And I honestly can\u2019t remember whether that was something specific to the Hill\u2019s business, whether it\u2019s innovation or a competitive thing or whether that was an area where consumers really did trade down. So I guess number one, you don\u2019t need to recreate history for me, but just in terms of your confidence that the Hill\u2019s business this time around is going to remain strong. Your volume growth there has been amazing. Just your confidence that if we do go into a recession, consumers are going to trade down and look for cheaper pet food? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes. If you go back to \u2013 I believe you\u2019re probably looking at \u201808, \u201809, and that was at least the beginning of the naturals boom, as you remembered. And as we have openly stated, we made in our view, some strategic errors in how we chase the naturals rather than staying true to the core business. So I think that was the biggest driver. And certainly, at that point in time, when the Hill\u2019s business was nowhere near as salient and had nowhere close to the momentum that it has today, and we\u2019re certainly on our front foot and continue to think about that business in terms of investment. You heard today that we closed the Nutriamo contract manufacturing facility that we bought in Italy. That is going to unlock more wet capacity for us, which is one of the fastest-growing segments, particularly in Europe, which is exciting. We\u2019re relaunching the Prescription Diet business going into the back half of this year, which is obviously about half of our business, which we think is going to be an exciting innovation for particularly our veterinarian professionals. So the business is in a much different place today than it was back in \u201808, \u201809. Obviously, much more on us on it. We\u2019re going to maintain the investment spend there, which we think is critically important. Again, this is a business that has low penetration and low share, so a lot of upside in North America and capacity constrained today, hence the reason of why the purchase of Nutriamo. So again, we think we\u2019re in a much different place than we were in \u201808, \u201809. The brand itself is significantly stronger than it\u2019s been in the past. Operator : And we will go to our next question from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Olivia Tong : Great, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to get a little bit more granularity around your full year EPS expectations and how much of the EPS revision is due to input costs versus FX rate as you handicap, but perhaps a 10 points ring on EPS expectations from one end of the pendulum to the other. And realizing, obviously, there is no shortage of uncertainty. But can you talk about what the most meaningful changes are there? And mathematically, how do you get from where you were to mid-singles down the singles? And then specifically for international markets, can you talk about what your peers are doing not just the multinationals, but the local players with respect to pricing, is the expectation that they are pricing or the realization what you\u2019re seeing so far that they are pricing at a commensurate level to what you\u2019re doing? Thank you so much. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Olivia. Great to hear from you. Let me just talk conceptually on the EPS, and then I\u2019ll have Stan jump in and give you a little bit more a bridge in terms of how we\u2019re thinking about it. But fundamentally, listen, this comes down to the extraordinary acceleration that we saw in our raw materials post the January guidance, which as you\u2019ve heard, is around $0.5 billion. So just add on its own is driving, obviously, the significant change in EPS, combined with the fact that our logistics have continued to accelerate. Part of that, we will work out of as we move through potentially the back half of the year with improved manufacturing and supply chain, which is obviously important for us to get that product on the shelf, as I mentioned, which is we\u2019re doing at a higher cost, but we anticipate logistics will stay high. Ocean rates, we are keeping ocean rates at where they are today for the balance of the year. And obviously, some of the transit rates that we\u2019re seeing, particularly out of Mexico, which are up about 30% versus the year ago period, we\u2019re assuming that will maintain itself as well. So, raw materials, largely driven by fast and oils, I will get Stan. Why don\u2019t I have Stan open that up a little bit for you. And then I\u2019ll come back and we will talk about the international markets and pricing. Stan Sutula : Sure. Thanks, Noel. So as we entered the year, we knew the commodity costs were going to be up year-on-year, and we planned for that. In January, we entered the year, we saw in the market. We expected that material cost would moderate as we went through the year. At that time, in January, we anticipated roughly $750 million or 13% and year-to-year increase. But as we stated in January, if the commodity costs don\u2019t moderate, that would represent a headwind. So what\u2019s happened? Since January, as you heard in our prepared remarks, we\u2019ve seen significant movement in those commodity costs. And now we see an incremental $500 million of cost for the year. What that means is that material costs will be up over 20% for the full year on a year-on-year basis. So we put some context a little bit underneath what\u2019s happening in those commodities. Natural gas is up over 60%. And natural gas is used to power many of our plants and importantly, many of our suppliers\u2019 plants, which puts pressure on their costs and timing. Soybean and corn are up by over third; palms, up 25% and increasing. So as we said earlier, what that means for the year, fats and oils, including palm will be up over 60% year-to-year and doubled since 2020. Resins are up over 20%. And these two categories combined fats and oils and resins make up a significant portion of the material spend and on a combined basis are up nearly 40%. Take glycerin, another important material, and that\u2019s more than doubled year-to-year. So as we\u2019ve looked at logistics, we saw similar cost inflation. And since we\u2019ve seen that increase, we\u2019ve over $150 million since our expectations in January, that translates to logistics being up nearly 20% for the full year. And some of this increase is because we prioritize meeting clients\u2019 needs. We talked briefly about this, our decision to prioritize toothbrush shipments given client demand and market opportunity, particularly in North America, we grew that category double digits and gained over 450 points of share. Now I think importantly, Noel talked about this would represent over a 20% increase to our cost over $1.2 billion. But what are we doing to tackle that and mitigate some of that significant escalation? On materials, we\u2019re leveraging alternate materials, we\u2019re viable, reformulating where that makes sense, taking price to reflect the cost increase. We\u2019ve talked about price significantly here. And then, things like leveraging analytics to enhance our procurement process and driving our robust Funding the Growth program to help mitigate that profit impact. On logistics, we are taking a number of actions. As our supply chain stabilizes from things like COVID-impact and material shortages, we\u2019re going to streamline our logistics use less expedited transport. Now temporarily, we\u2019re carrying more finished goods inventory due to erratic and longer transit times. We\u2019re also making things like investments in automating our warehouses. So while these remain volatile, we\u2019re being aggressive to tackle those. So from a P&L point of view, as you translate that down to EPS, those are going to be a headwind for us for the year. We\u2019re taking aggressive pricing, aggressive funding the growth and productivity actions but we\u2019re still expecting margin will contract for the year. And we are going to maintain investment in advertising. We believe that that\u2019s an important component of our long-term model, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve taken that our organic growth up to the 4% to 6% range. Take that down, we will continue to drive improvements in overhead. And stripping logistics, our overhead improved on a year-on-year basis. And the team has done a very good job of managing that prudently, but that\u2019s what yields us down to a EPS when you take into the effects the multiple interest rate hikes, a headwind on tax, that drives the EPS here down on a year-on-year basis to mid-single digits. Noel Wallace : So let me come back to what we\u2019re seeing on local brands and certainly private label to a certain extent as an extension of that. I would just return for some travel around Asia. We\u2019re certainly seeing some of the local brands take pricing there. And likewise, I think we\u2019re going to see private label follow very quickly. Obviously, these increases impact them, and their cost of goods are obviously materially higher than ours. So we will watch that carefully. We don\u2019t have a lot of categories that index highly with private label. Obviously, oral care very low single digits. The two categories that we need to watch carefully are liquid hands open toothbrushes. But so far, we have not seen a significant erosion or migration to private label and so [Technical Difficulty] as we see the environment unfold over the next few months. Operator : And we will go to our next question from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Yes. Hi, thanks everybody. Good morning. I guess I\u2019m curious as to how you think about the supply chain impacts in terms of quantification in the quarter, whether in terms of volume or market share, particularly in North America, but throughout your remarks or supply chain issues, including in Europe and Latin America, holding you back. So just curious as to how you think about how much you were held back and how that \u2013 how much of that kind of reverses and releases for the balance of the year, number one. And then number two, just maybe just some further details on China. It was down overall. I think in your release, you said that you called out Colgate China itself as a point of strength. So obviously, some timing there with Hawley & Hazel, but just some \u2013 maybe some more color on what happened in China and how you think about that market going forward, which is obviously a very dynamic context? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Steve. Listen, the supply chain, as we talked about throughout 2021 has been really choppy with a lot of second and third derivative impacts of all the implications related to COVID. But if you take specifically the impacts to us, where you really feel it is on shelf availability. And we have historically been best-in-class in that regard across our categories and some of the setbacks we saw from COVID lockdowns in China where we saw some of the challenges we\u2019ve seen in logistics coming out of Mexico, raw material suppliers as well, having shortfalls that caused a lot of choppiness in our supply chain throughout 2021 and certainly accelerated a bit as we went into the first \u2013 out of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. The good news is, as we finished off in the back half of February and into March, we saw a lot of those issues structurally get much, much better for us as a company. Our on-shelf availability, which should dip way below norms, was now back right at top of class. And you see that directly in our point-of-sale data in some of those customers where we actually now are measuring detailed on-shelf availability at the daily and weekly basis that allows us to react very, very quickly. We have taken decisions through 2021 and in the first quarter, to ensure that we have sufficient inventory to compensate some of those \u2013 the shortfalls that we we\u2019re seeing and the uncertainty that we had from various contractors or raw material suppliers. That has cost us some money but we feel in the end is now given the trade, obviously, far more \u2013 a clear line of sight in terms of our ability to source an increasing demand, particularly behind our toothpaste and toothbrush business here in the first quarter. So on-shelf ability significantly improved as we exited the quarter and has maintained itself as we went into April, that has translated into better market share performance. Take the U.S. in the last 5 weeks, we were up or flat in seven out of 11 categories, which is a marked improvement versus where we had been in the past. Some of the issues likewise translated into the European business where we saw some shortfalls in terms of service levels there, that now has been addressed through some decisions that we have taken, and we\u2019re seeing likewise, as we exited the quarter a little bit better volume. So all in all, across the board, \u2013 most of those issues now are behind us, particularly the lockdown issues that really had a significant impact on part of our business. And I give credit to the supply chain for doing a tremendous amount of agility work that I think is only going to set us up for stronger resilience moving forward as we see some of the uncertainty continue to unfold in certain parts of the world. China is actually a really good story from the sense of our CP China business was up high single digits in the quarter. Our CP China business, combined with Holly & Hazel, was up 650 basis points in market share in the online business, which is obviously the fastest-growing part of the China \u2013 the retail sector. Hawley & Hazel business was migrating, as I mentioned, Steve, to an entirely new portfolio and repositioning of the brand, including a brand name change that will incur \u2013 that was rolling out in the first quarter. As a result of the significant distribution scale of China, we were moving down inventories of old product distributors. We\u2019re obviously taking their inventories down in preparation for the excitement behind the relaunch. We\u2019ve started to see a lot of that unfold in the back end of March and now into April, and we will see it ultimately, it will take a couple more months before we see full distribution of that new product across the China market. So overall, the China business looks quite strong for us. For the first time in many, many years, our overall China market shares in toothpaste, that\u2019s combined, Hawley & Hazel and Colgate are up. So it\u2019s been a long time since you\u2019ve heard me say that, but I think that\u2019s a testament to some big strategic changes that we made in China. Now going back 2.5, 3 years, both in terms of portfolio strategy as well as go to market that we\u2019d say is definitely paying dividends. And we will watch obviously the Hawley and Hazel relaunch carefully but quite excited about that thus far in terms of how we\u2019re seeing it hit the market. Operator : We will go to our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, guys. Thanks for slotting me in. I guess a couple of questions. First, kind of building off your last comments around the online or the exit of the Darlie brand, when did that begin exactly like in the execution? And I imagine you\u2019re planning assumption is that you\u2019re not going to retain all of the sales as you migrate away from the brand. When do you think that pressure will be behind us? I think even or how many quarters do we have to live with what\u2019s likely going to be a drag from the rebranding? Noel Wallace : Sure. Listen, I mean, we expect, obviously, that we will not only hold but ultimately build share with this relaunch, Jason, that\u2019s the intent. I mean we have significant investment planned behind this relaunch. It is the number one brand in China, has incredible salience. We\u2019re putting in improved technology as well. We have an innovation stream that\u2019s coming behind this. Now there is no question there is always risk when you change a brand name, but all of the work that we\u2019ve done thus far and what we\u2019ve seen early days, that transition really started at the tail end of January, early February, the bulk of it starting to happen in March. And as I mentioned, will unfold more than likely over the next couple \u2013 2 to 3 months. We will know by the end of the second quarter, third quarter, where we are. We will get a good sense, particularly in the online world. As I mentioned, the vast majority \u2013 the fastest-growing channel is online in China. And we will get a read pretty quickly in how we are doing relative to our online business with Darlie in that market. But overall, this is a widely distributed product, very, very strong, obviously gets into C, D and E cities. So, it\u2019s widely distributed. It will take time to work through the old product, but we are starting to see some of the new product already on shelf in the modern trade, and so far, so good. But I would say, give us another quarter, the balance of this quarter to really assess how we are doing and come back to you with the point of view as we move into the third quarter. Operator : We will go to our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the supply chain question, because I do know that in fourth quarter or even third quarter results, you had talked about supply chain dynamics impacting North America. But at least to my recollection, this is the first we have heard about supply chain bottlenecks and headwinds for Latin America and Europe. And given it impacted sales in the quarter, I would think that you would had a sense of that by the time you reported 4Q. Same goes, honestly, for the sort of softer start to the year in January. So, I just \u2013 I wanted to ask specifically about the supply chain dynamics in Latin America and Europe. And then a broader question just on visibility because it just feels like \u2013 I know it\u2019s a volatile environment, but that there seems to be an intra-quarter moving target and just level of confidence, frankly, as we look forward for the balance of the year? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. Lauren, let me just clarify. We have not had supply chain issues in Latin America. The supply chain issues and the volatility that we have seen has principally been driven by the North America complexities that we have incurred as well as some shortfalls from some of our raw material suppliers in the middle of the quarter in Europe, which created obviously some constraints there. So, specifically, it\u2019s been North America driven by some lockdown issues in China as well as some of the COVID-related issues we had in some of our facilities here in North America. So, as I mentioned, we feel very good about where we have now in March. Structurally, things have gotten much better, efficiencies in the plant, asset utilization, capacity output, all are moving in the right direction, which are good indications that we are moving to where we want to be. And as I mentioned, some of the service level challenges that we have had. And I think everyone has moved through, but we were somewhat exacerbated by those in terms of our ability to get what we needed into some of our key customers are now back to historical high levels. So, good news there, no issue, Latin America. On Europe, specifically had dealt with a some raw material shortages that came from some of our suppliers mid-quarter. So, that was after we discussed it, we set guidance in January, that particularly hit us in Europe, and that has now moved behind us and things are back to a much more normalized level. We see that, quite frankly, all around the world. I mean if you look at a number of issues that we dealt with in 2021 and moving into the quarter this year with raw material suppliers or contractors, those seem to have subsided. Let\u2019s watch it carefully because anything can happen in the current world, given the uncertainty that everyone is faced with. But we have put a lot more resilience into the system now to deal with some of the unforeseen circumstances that we are seeing. Listen, in terms of visibility, Lauren, we were \u2013 we came out of last year understanding that we were faced with $750 million of incremental cost and we had the pricing in place to deal with that. And the gross margins came in more or less in line, actually just slightly below where we expected, a little bit above guidance to the Street in the first quarter. And then we got hit with the significant incremental increases to the tune of $0.5 billion post the January call, which came in mid-Feb and into March. So, that\u2019s been the single biggest issue in terms of visibility for us. We did not anticipate those. We had cost becoming more benign in the back half initially when we set guidance, obviously, with the war, all of that change. So, the visibility for us became dramatically different as we exited the quarter and hence the change in our guidance that we have communicated today. John Faucher : Lauren, if I could just add one thing, going back to your Latin America comment. There was some impact in Latin America, really, over the last couple of quarters relative to the supply chain issues we saw with plant lockdowns in Asia. So, that was what we were referring to in the prepared commentary. Noel Wallace : But no, nothing relative to LatAm for themselves, they have been able to obviously continue to do what they need to do. But as you know, we source quite a bit of product out of Latin America. The costs have gone up, but we don\u2019t have anything that we would consider significant there. Operator : We will go to our next question from Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI. Javier Escalante : Hi everyone. I say that two things that it would be helpful because \u2013 and it\u2019s really on Lauren\u2019s question. This is that it feels that your supply chain is very global. And when you speak about Colgate, you talk about toothpaste and not toothbrushes. And then the problem in Latin America seems to be that you have problems sourcing toothbrushes out of Asia and toothpaste in the U.S. is out of Mexico. So, I think that there is a little bit of a disconnect between our understanding of the supply chain and your conversation. So, if you could clarify, in the U.S., what are the supply chain issues? Is it that Mexico is not delivering into the U.S.? And then in Latin America, is it that toothbrushes in Asia are now coming through into Latin America? And finally, in Latin America, you basically said that you had no supply chain issues, but volumes dropped. So, why is the drop, because if you think about Procter and Unilever, they grew organic sales in Latin America in 16%, so the consumer seems to be fine. So, what is that \u2013 why is it that Latin America is lagging your competitors? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Okay. Let me address the supply chain first. Toothbrushes, first and foremost, is a global supply chain we source predominantly out of Asia as well as some sourcing out of Latin America. Obviously, given the lockdowns that we saw in Asia in 2021 and subsequently having an impact in the first quarter that impacted most of our global toothbrush business around the world, more acutely here in the U.S., where we have taken decisions in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter, to ensure that we accelerated migration of those toothbrushes when supply came back online, back into refill inventories and improve on-shelf ability. So, we had issues there, particularly for North America, where we are having to bring product in expediently in order to fulfill demand. That impacted some of our sourcing \u2013 some of our toothbrush business likewise in Latin America, likewise in Europe, but it was more acutely faced by the North America business, and we addressed that. Our toothpaste business historically has been a balance of a global supply chain that works very, very efficiently. Given some of the challenges that we had in the North America, we were bringing more product out of Mexico, they were fulfilling increased demand for our product. It came into additional costs. Obviously, as we talked about earlier, that freight rates out of Mexico increased. We did have some delays getting product across the border at times, but that was not a function of our problem. It was a function of what was happening systemically across the marketplace. So, our toothpaste supply chain is global. It has been a competitive advantage for us for years and years. We are able to now transfer products from one market to another quite consistently and quite efficiently. But as you have delays in one market or supplier implications in one market, it obviously creates a little bit of a bottleneck for you. We have taken decisions to ensure that we are having locations that are efficiently sourcing local markets where needed. And I think today, we are in a much better position than we have been in the past related to dealing with the uncertainty of the supply chain network that exists in the world that we live in today. So, overall, we think we are in a good place. On volumes for Latin America, listen, the only real shortfall in volumes for us in Latin America was Brazil. We took high-double digit pricing, 15% pricing in that market. We saw volumes come off a little bit, which historically has been consistent with where we have seen. We have taken significant pricing. Mexico had positive pricing, positive volumes across the board. So, I would really attribute it to some of the softness we saw in Brazil, because the rest of the business is okay, and we will see how Brazil unfolds. But this is quite consistent with what we have seen in the past when we have taken significant pricing. Operator : And we will take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Thanks and good morning everyone. I guess I wanted to go back and try to understand the pricing strategy for \u201822. So, you talked obviously about being $750 million or so cost headwind in January, which has obviously gotten bigger, but it was still a big number back then. It seems others were a bit more proactive, at least it seems to me, more proactive and got stronger pricing earlier in the year. And I guess your comment to gross margin for you all was better than guided, but it was still down a lot. So, I guess I am curious, was there a volume calculus in your decision to seemingly lag some peers on pricing. And now that you are taking more price, how should we be thinking about volumes relative to pricing for \u201822? In other words, kind of what has changed or how do we think about the change in your assumptions there. So, if you could talk about the decision kind of first of all, whether that\u2019s right or not? And then how we think about the volume change as a result? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes. What happened in the first quarter, obviously, as we saw a little bit of delays in our pricing execution in Europe, which I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, given some of the annual negotiations and ultimately how those unfolded. The good news is those are behind us as we exited the quarter, and we will see that pricing fully reflected as we move into the second quarter. We were a little late in the U.S. arguably, I think in terms of how we sell things, but we did lead pricing in our core business ahead of competition. We have seen competition ultimately follow, but we did lead in the U.S. So, we felt like we got to have it pretty quickly, but obviously, the costs moved a little bit beyond what we expected. So, coming back to gross margin, we were kind of more in line with what we thought. We thought we would see most of the pricing come through in the back half of the quarter, which would obviously deliver accelerated sequential gross margin through the balance of the year. That was the initial assumption. But obviously, all things changed when the February-March \u2013 mid-February, March cost increases came through. We have now subsequently taken more pricing. We will be taking more pricing in developing part of the world as we move through the balance of the year. And we are also looking at obviously accelerated pricing, particularly through re-launches in the developed part of the world as we move through the back half. Operator : We will go to our next question from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Noel, I think we covered a lot of this. I wanted to kind of pick up on Lauren\u2019s question and some others. Just the degree of the downward revision of your outlook versus peers and even more broadly staples, so everyone can appreciate how challenging the environment is. It\u2019s not lost in anyone for a moment. But it\u2019s difficult for everyone, right, at the same time. So, without being redundant because we spend a lot of time on the cost headwinds and supply chain issues. But what do you feel like is materially different about your business, product categories, commodity basket, the speed or scope with which you can move on pricing, supply chain, scope of productivity savings, controls around FP&A, your stance on conservatism in guidance. As you look at that relative to the peers, which I know you guys are following closely, what do you think is very unique about your business that\u2019s causing a sharper downward revision than we have seen elsewhere? Thanks for that. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks Kevin. Listen, I think we stated it upfront. What is uniquely different for us right now is obviously the significant move we have seen in fats and oils. And that is a significant part of our cost structure of our business in addition to things that have moved up quite significantly, that historically have been quite benign relative to our cost of goods, things like glycerin, which have doubled in pricing. So, fats and oils is the big driver here. We are assuming that those costs will stay at the current levels and slightly increase through the balance of the year. I don\u2019t know how others have assumed that. As a result, we have seen \u2013 we have taken oil more or less at current levels with a slight increase through the balance of the year. That may be a different assumption than others have taken. And we obviously have the logistics on cost given our short-term implications of our global supply chain, which we ultimately think as we move into 2023, will move behind us. So, that\u2019s predominantly the biggest difference. We have very strong brands that allow us to take pricing. You have seen that consistently year-in, year-out, our ability to take pricing, particularly in the developing part of the world, and we will continue to execute against that, but we will watch the consumer environment very carefully. We are maintaining our investments in the business. That\u2019s very important for us to continue to accelerate the top line growth. That\u2019s hence why we feel good about the 4% to 6% organic, given that we will be maintaining our investments in that piece. So, it\u2019s really that. Our logistics \u2013 our overhead structure, just to talk to that, we have the global productivity initiative, as you know, that we have launched. We are accelerating the savings in that through the back half of this year. Our operating costs or just our direct overheads were actually down in the quarter, which again, we will get the leverage from that as we move and accelerate sales through the back half of the year. But the biggest difference is we are assuming a continued \u2013 a very, very costly inflationary environment through the balance of the year. We don\u2019t see that changing at this point. I am not sure the assumptions that others have made or whether they made any assumptions at this stage, but we feel it\u2019s prudent for the business to create the visibility that you need that we are assuming, those costs will continue to be at current levels or slightly above. Operator : Our last question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you for taking my follow-up. Just on the Brazil comment, I understand like, you mentioned Noel, that the pricing and there was some price elasticity. I was just hoping if you can touch, was it more on the personal care side or auto care, or what are your plans to kind of make it perhaps more competitive given that the currencies went to your favor, I think that\u2019s the good news there. Is there any ways of trying to defend the share \u2013 the volume share given that you probably took pricing more in dollar terms than you would appreciate at that point? Noel Wallace : Sure. Listen, it\u2019s early days. We obviously took pricing very, very quickly, as I mentioned, we saw volumes come off a little bit in the business. And it was quite frankly, more in the personal. Our market shares in toothpaste are actually up 20 basis points in Brazil. So, overall, we have seen again, coming back to the core strategy, we have re-launched our Sorriso business, which is performing very well in the market. We launched Colgate Total, which is performing well in the market, and you have heard us talk about MX. So, market mix, so market shares are actually up. We will see or we will watch that very closely, but we feel pretty good about where we are, but we have got pricing in the P&L. We anticipate that, obviously, competition will follow given our leadership position in the marketplace, but that will be up for them to decide. But we feel good about where we are. And the volumes, historically, when we have taken pricing at these levels are more or less consistent in terms of the falloff that we would have expected. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Noel, I will turn the call back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Noel Wallace : No. Thanks everyone. Let me again extend my appreciation to all Colgate people. Let me specifically call out our employees in the Ukraine, who our thoughts and prayers are with you, and we continue to support you and your health and your safety with all the possible opportunities that we can provide you. Thanks everyone. We will talk soon. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded and it\u2019s being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President, M&Q, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John. Thank you. John Faucher : Thanks, Caroline. Good morning. And welcome to our 2022 second quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and earnings materials and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will now provide you with his thoughts on our Q2 results and our 2022 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. Noel? Noel Wallace : Thanks, John, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. I am delighted to share with you our second quarter results. On the first quarter call, I talked about my confidence that our organic sales growth would accelerate from our first quarter results. Some of this was due to the improvement in trends in February, March and April that we discussed on the call. But what really gives me confidence is the fundamental changes Colgate people have made to drive growth, which is why we are raising our organic sales growth guidance to 5% to 7% for 2022. Our second quarter results including double-digit organic sales growth in Oral Care and Pet Nutrition, show that the growth strategies we put in place three years ago are delivering on our objectives and how the power of our global portfolio is working. We are delivering growth across all of our divisions and all of our categories. We are showing the ability to take pricing because we have built healthier brands. We have built up our innovation capabilities so we can deliver more breakthrough and transformational innovation that can drive both category growth and market share. We have accelerated our digital transformation across the company by leveraging the capabilities we have built at Hill\u2019s and in China, and other developed markets to lead ecommerce in our markets where this important growth channel is underdeveloped. And crucially in this operating environment, our revenue growth management tools are driving positive pricing and mixes our efforts to offset the significant raw material and logistics inflation we are seeing, although, the -- along with the productivity and our ability to improve our price mix, which has enabled us to rebuild our gross margin moving forward. And looking at the quarter, the second quarter marked our 14th consecutive quarter with organic sales growth either in or above our long-term target range of 3% to 5% and that growth is broad based. We delivered organic sales growth in all six of our divisions. We delivered organic sales growth in all four of our categories, Oral Care, Pet Nutrition, Personal Care and Home Care, with all four categories either in line with or above our long-term target range of 3% to 5%. As we discussed on the first quarter call, our execution on revenue growth management and premiumization allowed us to deliver a 500 basis points sequential acceleration in pricing growth. Encouragingly, despite this pricing, our volume performance also improved sequentially in the quarter on both a one year and a two-year basis, behind strong marketing plans, innovation and improved supply chain performance. Our market share performance continues to improve with our global toothpaste and manual toothbrushes are now up on a year-to-date basis. We continue to deliver on productivity with another strong quarter of funding to growth, which is vital to our plans to regain lost gross margin. As we enter the back half, we are just beginning to see early benefits from my 2022 global productivity initiative. Over the next 18 months, this program will help drive operating leverage. But we are still dealing with a very difficult cost environment. We now expect $1.3 billion in raw material and packaging inflation, with higher logistics costs as well. Foreign Exchange has become a bigger headwind since our first quarter earnings release. The euro has moved to parity with the dollar and most other currencies have weakened as well. But we will continue to invest in our brands, advertising spending was up on $1 basis, with continued shift to working from non-working and higher focus on digital spending. We are investing our capital to drive future growth as well. We are building capacity to meet strong consumer demand, particularly for Hill\u2019s, but also for other projects like our recyclable tube, which we continue to roll out across the globe. As we look to the balance of 2022 and into next year, we are focused on executing our strategies with the right innovation, brand support revenue growth management and capital plans to deliver on our long-term growth targets, while working to rebuild our gross margins and deliver sustainable profitable growth in all four of our categories. And with that, I am happy to take your questions. Caroline, can we move to the Q&A. Caroline? John Faucher : Okay. If everyone can just hold on, we are working. It seems like there\u2019s a problem on their end on the call. Noel Wallace : Are we in? Yeah. John Faucher : You are muted. Yeah. We are working on it. Everyone can just hold tight. There\u2019s a problem on the conference call and so, hopefully, we will be back up shortly. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Apologies, that question will actually come from Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Noel Wallace : Hey, Peter. Peter Grom : I hope you are doing well. Yeah. So, Noel, I was just wondering if we could take a step back and can you maybe just give us an update on kind of the health of the consumer in some of your key markets, particularly emerging markets and maybe specifically Latin America? Are you beginning to see any signs of softening demand or trade down in your core categories? And I guess, how do you think emerging market growth evolves from here as we look out to the back half of the year and potentially into 2023? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the question. If you scan at least the numbers we are looking around the world, you continue to see great pretty good vitality at the consumer level, emerging markets growing mid-single digits, obviously some slowdown in the developed world, particularly out of Europe where you saw some sluggishness in the categories. But specifically to your question on emerging, it looks pretty good now. A lot of pricing as you can imagine going through, but if we come back to our overarching strategy and as we really laid out in the first quarter that we would be continuing to take pricing coupled with strong revenue growth management, but more importantly, accelerating our innovation cycle into those markets. Strong innovation on the premium and the value orientation side has allowed us obviously to continue to deliver strong topline growth, both in price and in volume. We will watch the consumer really closely, Peter. We obviously have a lot of teams on the ground, looking at exactly where the elasticities are. But so far, elasticities are in line with what we expected or slightly better. But that will change over time as you see more and more pricing going into the market and other economic factors impact categories. But, overall, so far we have seen the categories behave as we expected. Not a lot of trade down, but its early days. We will see how that evolves over time. Operator : And our next question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. Noel Wallace : Hi, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So, you just mentioned the elasticity looks pretty good so far. Can you just talk a little bit about the competitive environment, given the strong pricing you are able to realize in the quarter? Are you seeing competitors move at similar levels? And then specifically, maybe talk a little bit about the Americas in terms of the sustainability of this growth turnaround we have seen in the U.S.? And if you could just touch on the consumer in Latin America, that would be helpful also? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. In terms of, just an overarching statement on competition, clearly, it\u2019s been constructive relative to how we have seen competitors behave and I don\u2019t pretend to understand their strategies or quite frankly react to them. We are very focused on executing our strategies in the marketplace and as we laid out again in early on the first quarter call that we would be taking a leading pricing in some of the markets, and ultimately, we expected given the inflation is impacting everyone, we would see competition follow as well and that\u2019s been the case by and large around the world. So, overall, a constructive environment relative to pricing. In terms of the Americas, obviously, you have seen strong turnaround in our North America business. Again, we highlighted that we were taking pricing and saw momentum build in the first quarter, and that continued as we mentioned in the first quarter call through April, and obviously, you see now with the performance of the North America business, a good performance overall. I would call out that, obviously, they saw strong consumption across the categories. The innovation is certainly taking hold, excited to see the takeaway on Pro Series, which is at the premium end of the toothpaste. You have seen the market share and scanner performance, with scanner data in the U.S. up in 11, eight -- eight of 11 categories over the last 13 weeks, which again, I think, shows the turnaround of that business, and importantly, the performance of some of our innovation coming in broad-based across all the categories in which we compete. So, overall, good. We are watching this closely. It\u2019s an unpredictable environment relative to where we see consumers evolving, where we see inflation evolving. But the good news is, we have taken pricing, we have more pricing planned across the world moving into the back half and we will watch the consumer impact of that very carefully. Dara Mohsenian : Okay. Operator : And Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities has our next question. Chris Carey : Hi. Good morning. So pretty good progress on North American margins sequentially as pricing has built, you noted in the prepared remarks that, your supply chain headwinds are starting to abate and with pretty good traction with the consumer on this pricing, I just wonder if you have any updated thoughts on where we stand today on just the potential to rebuild margins in that segment even amidst the inflation, which is going to be a little bit higher than your prior expectations? Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks, Chris. You have known our company for many years, how focused we are on gross profit and we will continue to be laser focused on recovering gross profit as we move through the balance of this year and into 2023. The pricing and innovation strategies and revenue growth management discipline that we have across the organization is clearly focused and tailored towards getting our teams equipped to find innovative ways to drive category growth, get value into the categories through pricing and other innovation initiatives and that will clearly be the roadmap moving forward. And we feel quite confident given the health of our brands, the investment that we have been putting behind our brands, that we will have the ability to continue to take pricing in the marketplace. We will watch it very closely as I mentioned. But recognizing we have a very broad portfolio of products. We compete at the high end and at the low end of the market, and historically, we have been able to flex our portfolio quite well in markets where we have had difficult economic circumstances. So we will continue to innovate across all price points and be sure that we are capturing any trade down if that happens, which we have not seen at this stage. But, ultimately, I would expect you will see some trade down moving forward and we will continue to innovate the top end to drive the premiumization opportunity that we see. Operator : And our next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Andrea Teixeira : Good morning and thank you for the new call format and prepared remarks. So my question is on pricing and a follow-up on volumes in Europe and Asia-Pac. On pricing, you had an impressive 8.5 global uptick in the quarter globally and about 3% in North America. So I believe there is additional pricing or as you mentioned coming through potentially oral care, I believe in the U.S. in July. Can you confirm the timing and the magnitude? And in Europe, in terms of volumes, you lost -- perhaps you lost temporary distribution, because you had a 3% decline in volume there. I mean, not sure if it\u2019s related to the war. And if you can round up the Asia-Pac exit rate also, Noel Wallace, because you exit and you had a minus 17, just to make sure that we recover all basis. I mean not to take the -- and obviously the 9% organic growth, but I just want to make sure that we know the puts and takes there? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks. A lot packed in that one. So let me talk a little bit about the overarching thoughts around organic growth in the topline. Obviously, strong pricing is 8.5. But I call out the positive volume growth where we saw across North America, Asia and Hill\u2019s, and if you take obviously the impact of Russia, that volume moved up nearly 100 basis points. So, overall, we are very pleased with the broadness of the pricing that we took across all divisions and the positive volume growth that we saw across some of the markets that I just mentioned. When you look at, specifically calling out some of the other markets, Europe obviously was impacted by a couple of things, the negotiations on pricing certainly impacted categories. We tend to see some elasticity in Europe happen early on as the market adjusted to the new pricing, but ultimately, that tends to become -- that is mitigated over time as you see everyone take pricing. Asia, you asked about, obviously strong growth in Asia, both in pricing and in volume. We had an easier comp on Hawley & Hazel, but I would call out the CP China business, which grew significantly in the quarter as well on a more difficult comp. So overall really pleased with China, despite the lockdowns that we saw in the marketplace there. So we were able to overcome that and deliver strong consumption growth across most of our business. So, overall, we are pleased with the balance of pricing and volume. We are pleased with how we are getting pricing executed, and more importantly, we are pleased with the innovation that\u2019s going into the market across multiple price points in order to sustain that moving forward. Moving forward, I would say that, we will continue to be pushing pricing and my expectation is we will see some pressure on volume in the year to go, but that\u2019s to be expected as we get more pricing in the market. The important part is the balance of innovation across all price points to mitigate that. Operator : And our next question will come from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hey guys. Good morning. Noel Wallace : Good morning. Kaumil Gajrawala : Can you talk maybe or compare and contrast what your market shares look like from a volume perspective versus revenue perspective. Obviously, elasticities are better than planned, but curious on how it looks like versus the market. And then on your assumptions for commodity costs, are they linked to just assuming spot stays where it is or do you have some assumptions in there for things, particularly like palm oil and such? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, very -- we are very pleased with the share performance. Now recognize that a lot of the share performance that we public -- that we make public don\u2019t pickup ecommerce shares and some of the untracked channels. But that being said, our global shares continue to track well on both toothpaste and toothbrushes. Obviously, we are taking pricing. So we are seeing value shares respond to that. Volume shares have been a little bit softer. But if you look back historically, where you have seen very acute pricing enter the marketplace, over time, you see volume come down. But over time, as I mentioned, it\u2019s our responsibility to bring innovation across price points, our responsibility to work with the trade to drive volume back in the categories. We have big traffic builders. Our brands are strong around the world and we know our retailers rely on us to bring traffic into their stores and drive volume and basket. So we will continue to focus on finding innovation to ensure that the volume aspect of the category is protected. But I do expect, as we get more pricing in the market, volumes will be a little bit soft year to go, but we will manage that very, very closely. On commodity specifically, again, coming back to the first quarter, we talked about $1.2 billion of raw material inflation. We have adjusted that up to $1.3 billion this quarter. There is most of that will come in the second quarter, but we will get a lot of that coming back through the back half of the year. We have new spot rates as you mentioned and we have seen, obviously, some commodities come down, but we are pretty much locked in for the third quarter. Any benefit to any deflation that we see will get a little bit of that in the fourth quarter, possibly more of that coming in 2023. But we will look to, obviously continue to take pricing given the unprecedented environment that we are seeing both on raw materials and logistics, and make sure that we have the marketing plans to execute that effectively. Operator : And our next question will come from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on quarter as always. Noel Wallace : Hi, Kevin. Kevin Grundy : Hey. Good morning. Good morning, everyone. Noel, just to kind of pull together some of the pieces of what you have touched on with respect and as it pertains to the guidance, so you hedged it up your 5% from 4% to 6%. And, I am just looking to get at some of the macro and category-specific assumptions underlying that, understanding it\u2019s going to differ little bit by category, but it does imply the midpoint of deceleration in the back half of the year, again to each of year-over-year comparisons. And maybe just touch on that a little bit and maybe just some conservatism around elasticities that you have seen and should elasticities hold its upside, but maybe just comment on pulling together some of the commentary so forth and so far on the call relative to the guidance in the back half? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yeah. So, obviously, we have taken our guidance up based on the consumption we are seeing in the market based on the fact that we have been able to get strong pricing and early on, obviously, see some good volume moving through the P&L. FX continues to be the biggest incremental issue that we see based on where we were in the first quarter. But, overall, we see the categories behaving as we expected. Now given the incredible unpredictability of what\u2019s happening in the global world right now, we are watching those category performance very, very carefully. Our estimations are based on the fact the elasticity will be consistent with what we expected it to be or slightly better and we will adjust accordingly as we move down the road, but it\u2019s very difficult to predict exactly what\u2019s going to happen at this stage. So we based our macros on what we can see today and what we can control. So let\u2019s come back to what we can control. We control the execution of our strategy and we are executing against all the things that we have talked about, driving the core, looking at adjacencies, new channels and some of the faster growth channels particularly ecommerce, and you see that delivering in the results that we have had over the last 14 quarters. So we are pleased with the strategies taking hold. I think the competencies we are building around digital across the entire enterprise, the competencies that we are building on innovation are all starting to track well in terms of how we evaluate them and we are seeing that play out in the performance. Operator : Our next question will come from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Good morning, everyone. Noel Wallace : Hey, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : I wanted to ask a question about just -- more broadly about just the rebuilding of gross margins and so like forgetting about the constructs of fiscal years and timeframes. Just is it -- can you rebuild gross margins if inflation were to or your cost of goods basket today were to stay at its current level so the inflation doesn\u2019t proceed? Would it be possible to rebuild gross margins with cost at this level or does it somewhat depend upon some sort of disinflation, if you will, in the cost basket? Noel Wallace : Yeah. It depends on a couple of things, Bryan. First and foremost, we believe that over the longer term our focus is on rebuilding gross margins and we feel quite confident that we can do that, particularly in the current environment, given the strength of our brand, the investment we are putting behind the brands and the innovation grid that we have out in front of us. A couple of things that need to happen, obviously, the pricing in the market needs to hold, as you see inflation come down, it\u2019s a real question of where competitors will go with pricing. We think it\u2019s been quite rational to this stage. We think that given the unprecedented levels that you will see constructive moves around pricing and promotion moving forward. But we are prepared for that. It\u2019s really the flex of our portfolio across different price points that we need to manage very, very carefully. So in my view, if inflation holds, the big determinant will be, will pricing hold, and my sense is, given where we see the marketplace today, that will be the case. So the answer is longer term, yes, we absolutely believe that we can rebuild gross margins. Bryan Spillane : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much and congratulations on terrific results. Also kind of stepping back, Noel, over the last two years or three years, and what appears to us to be a very disciplined and systematic manner, you have kind of addressed various issues, whether it\u2019s channel in the drug stores and in digital, whether it\u2019s premiumization, whether it\u2019s competition against local brands and really you have done a fantastic job executing and improving the momentum of the business on a commercial basis. Apart from the macro factors that are going on today and not to diminish those, but in terms of the general commercial strategy, where is the focus now in terms of improving your actual business momentum and what are you doing to address that? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Rob, and good morning. So if you come back again, I think, to the heart of our strategy, which is big core businesses that need to be innovated against and you see that coming through. We have got a pretty significant innovation on our anti-cavity business going, coming out in some of the developing part of the world. The premiumization aspect that we have talked about for quite some time, Rob. We continue to obviously unfold that across different parts of our category, whether it would be on our Hill\u2019s business or whether it be on our Oral Care business, most recently with the Pro Series launch, which is a great innovation with our highest level of hydrogen peroxide in the marketplace. And obviously, looking into the adjacencies and new channels, if we talk about new channels specifically to your point, we still see a lot of runway there. Most of our markets, our online share is now above our general market share, which is terrific. I call out China specifically where we are up as you saw in the prepared remarks, 600 basis points on our ecommerce share and that\u2019s the largest ecommerce business we have in Oral Care across the world and that\u2019s been driven through good premium innovation, a lot of good personalized marketing, getting into data driven decisions in terms of how we think about it. I come back to the success we have on digital and really equate it back to what we did with Hill\u2019s years back. I mean, that knowledge transfer that we had on Hill\u2019s where we went digital and online is transferring all around the world and we are seeing great results in our ecommerce business specifically. It\u2019s up to now about 14% of our total sales. It was up nearly 20% in the quarter in terms of growth. So, overall, we are seeing a lot of those strategies we put in place. Moving forward, not a lot of changes, Rob. We are focused on the execution. I think getting some of the supply chain constraints behind us is critically important for us and that allows us to get back to focusing on what we do best, which is execution and innovation across multiple price points and that\u2019s exactly where we see things unfolding. Revenue growth management will be critically important to our success moving forward. I think the discipline that we have on the ground quarter-to-quarter gets better. Are we where we need to be? No. But the pricing you see reflected over the last two quarters where you see at least a two-year stack on pricing, which looks terrific for us, I think is a testament to the fact that we are finding ways to build off the strength of our brands and get value executed in the marketplace. So, not a lot of changes, more focused on revenue growth management, more focused on our productivity initiatives. And in terms of funding the growth and our Global Productivity Program, which you are well aware of, getting that executed in the back half and early 2023. So, again, let\u2019s focus on what we do best, get on our front foot and continue to execute. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Yes. Hey. Good morning. Noel, actually picking up on some of the things you were just talking about -- at the end, I guess, based on your prepared remarks and your commentary just now, it sounds like most of your earlier supply chain issues have generally abated around the world. I just wanted to confirm that and to see if call -- if -- see if there is any color you have around bottlenecks that you are still working through, number one. And then number two, on line of sight to funding the growth and savings from the Global Productivity initiative. Just maybe a little bit of color around how those savings can accelerate in the back half, I think, they are expected to, but just maybe confirm that and whether we should expect that to skew at all to the fourth quarter versus the third quarter? Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks, Steve, and good morning. So let me address the supply chain first. Clearly, a lot of headwinds over the last six months to nine months, COVID related, obviously, at the heart of that, which has been somewhat consistent with the space and you are seeing others obviously talk about that more now. A lot of the supply chain North America issues are behind us, you have seen that obviously translate into much better on shelf availability, and obviously, that translates into good consumption for our brands and the market share performance that we had over the last 13 weeks. It is still a very, very unpredictable environment in terms of what we are seeing there. The team is all over it. But I think the tougher part is behind us certainly across North America. I would say, given the strong demand that we are seeing on Hill\u2019s, obviously, that team is doing an extraordinary job, continuing to deliver on what we need to have to meet the demand we are seeing in the marketplace. Obviously, 18% organic, comping 15% from last year is a really strong performance and I give the supply chain -- our global supply chain who is pulling on resources from all of our businesses around the world to bring in thoughts and ideas on how to continue to meet that capacity. We made some good strategic decisions on our balance sheet. Obviously, the Nutriamo facility that we have opening up in Europe will alleviate some of that, but we need to watch Hill\u2019s carefully, because obviously, the consumption is high, which I don\u2019t anticipate we will see that level of consumption quarter-to-quarter. We will see some strengths and some slowdown. But, overall, the underlying fundamentals of that business are strong. We need to ensure we continue to execute from a supply chain standpoint. So, overall, we feel much better about where we are globally from a supply chain. On funding the growth and GPI. GPI as we mentioned will be more back half loaded and into 2023. We had a marginal amount of savings come through in the second quarter. The bulk of the savings will come through in the third quarter and fourth quarter and into 2023, and you will see obviously that likewise in funding the growth. It\u2019s pretty evenly spaced. But, historically, we get a little bit more funding the growth in the back half and the teams are obviously very focused. We talked about that in the first quarter call that we had a lot more focus against funding the growth given the unprecedented environment, and fortunately, the global productivity initiative that we put in place last year in anticipation of a more difficult marketplace, we are starting to see the benefits of that unfold this year. Operator : And our next question will come from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Olivia Tong : I want to talk about how in your view the competitive environment might change given all the global sort of macro slowdown concerns? Does it --how do you think about this? Does it perhaps puts you in a better competitive positioning, particularly in emerging markets versus some smaller local players? And then just following up, you mentioned a couple of times that you do expect trade down. You haven\u2019t seen it yet, but you are expecting it to come. But you are still planning to price, and obviously, the Hill\u2019s results speak for themselves. So if you could just kind of triangulate those different pieces of expecting trade down, but obviously, not seeing it yet, that would be helpful? Thank you so much. Noel Wallace : Yeah. A couple of things. So, first of all, if I take the back end of your question first, the strategy that we have deployed in high inflationary times, which we have a lot of experience in this marketplace doing that is to balance our entire portfolio. We have -- we compete across multiple price points. In some countries, five to six different price points in a specific category. That allows us to be very thoughtful on where we take pricing and when we take pricing. And obviously, a lot of the analytics that we have in place, Olivia, now allow us to kind of see where consumers are trading in and out of to ensure that we are adjusting our strategies accordingly. And I think that flexibility and agility that we have learned over the years in managing high inflationary markets has afforded us the opportunity to think very carefully about how we want to adjust to this moving forward. The competitive environment may change, for sure. If inflation becomes more benign, there may be a decision by others to decide to put that into promotion to get some volume. But as I mentioned earlier on, I think, the market seems to be acting quite rationally. This is an unprecedented environment for all CPG relative to the levels of inflation and so my instinct is you are not going to see a lot of people chasing volume by discounting price, they are going to try to get -- regain margin into the P&L. You know, Colgate is very focused on gross profit. We will continue to be focused on getting pricing into the P&L as that allows us to maintain the advertising support to drive the topline and make sure we get our innovation while seated in the marketplace and I don\u2019t really see that changing over the foreseeable future. We will flex our portfolio accordingly and the good news is we compete across so many price points across all of our categories that we feel that buffers us a bit for against any trade down that we see in the marketplace. Operator : We will now take a question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I want to ask a question on Pet Care, specifically, without obviously drilling down too much. But the performance has been really strong, right? You go back even pre-pandemic, just really has gotten better since kind of mid-2000. I think what a lot of people know understand is that there were a lot of pet adoptions during the early parts of the pandemic, which continue. I guess if you could unpack a bit of how much of the contribution has come from that and maybe if you could talk about how you measure your success amongst that newer cohort in terms of your market share amongst those that have adopted pets over the last two years? And given that they are probably somewhat new to pet ownership, how do you think about the risk if any of trade down given where the economy maybe going? Noel Wallace : Yeah. Back on Hill\u2019s. Clearly, strong performance. The strategies that we have deployed on Hill\u2019s are the same strategies we have deployed across all of our categories. And the learning that we have had from Hill\u2019s, it certainly is they have been much more at the forefront on digital and online, as I mentioned earlier. That knowledge transfer has been terrific and shared the cross the world relative to how we are thinking about the business. And if you go back to the essence of our strategy, it\u2019s faster growth channels, and obviously, they are looking at ecommerce as an opportunity for growth. The expansion into new markets, our global supply chain, as well as our global footprint allows them to think about more expansion. Clearly, they are seeing a pickup from pet ownership in the U.S. that works in perpetuity in many respects, because consumers are going to -- pet owners are going to continue to feed their pets. We have benefited, I think, from getting back to what we stand for which is science. Science is inherent to all of our core categories, whether it\u2019s Oral Care, Skin Health and we use that platform to really drive innovation, drive superior consumer benefits and health benefits across the value chain and you are seeing that obviously translate into strong growth for that business. So, again, core adjacencies, channels, get back to what we stand for, which is science and superiority, leveraging our professional model across the enterprise. They have done a terrific job obviously with their vet partnerships, which again is akin to what we do in oral care and what we do in skincare. The digital work that Hill\u2019s is doing is the best-in-class for us as a company. As you know, they built that business with a digital-first mindset. Obviously, now we are taking digital into thematic advertising as we expand penetration for the brand and expand brand awareness, which candidly are quite low still. So, all in all, we feel very good about where we are. Strong growth, we have got tough comps moving forward, as I mentioned earlier, but we feel pretty good about where we are and where the consumer is. If you go back to 2007, 2008, during the last recession, we did not see a lot of trade down out of the Hill\u2019s business during that time. So we feel pretty good. The brand is stronger. We are innovating and we are spending behind the brand moving forward. Obviously, the supply chain is an opportunity to move this forward and we are using our balance sheet accordingly to address that. Operator : Your next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Noel Wallace : Hi, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : I just had two questions. First of all, just to clarify, you would mentioned earlier, plans on second half pricing and I was just curious and if you can tell us geographically, I think, it was in regard to North America, specifically, but I just was -- if you are looking for a little bit more detail on that? And then the second thing was on advertising spending. In the release, you had mentioned a plan now for it to be flat as a percentage of sales, still up in dollar terms and you did raise the sales outlook, but I just wanted to get a sense for how you might describe advertising spending plans today versus where they maybe were at the start of the year? That would just be helpful. Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. So, on pricing, let me just make it more on a global basis. Clearly, with the inflation that we have seen as we talked about in the first quarter and we are very clear in laying out visibility in the first quarter around where we saw pricing evolve through the quarter. Obviously, it accelerated in the back half of the first quarter and into April. We expect pricing will accelerate as we look at our organic growth composition through the balance of the year. That means obviously that we will have new pricing executed in the back half of the year and that will be pretty broad based across the world. I am not going to get into specific regions. But I will say that we will be taking pricing across both to developed and developing world in the back half of the year and that will be depend on categories, competitive situations and we are looking at each of that very closely, but broad based we are taking pricing across the world. Relative to advertising, obviously, given the strong topline, the percentage of sales came down. Our absolute dollar was a little bit up. We expect our dollar increase to be up in the back half of the year as we continue to support our strong innovation plans and as a percentage of sales, we are estimating that, that will come in more or less in line with where we were last year. You saw in the prepared remarks, we are spending a lot more time thinking about our digital advertising and the return on investment. We are getting there. We are moving a lot more money from non-working into working media in order to balance some of the growth opportunities we see in the market. So we feel pretty good about where we are from an advertising standpoint and intend to continue to invest to build our branch. Operator : And our final question will come from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Noel Wallace : Hi, Jason. Jason English : Hey, there. Thanks for spotting me in. If -- sorry, if my question is redone into maybe your prepared remarks, your 10-Q, but we got a lot of information dumped on us today. I must confess, I have not been able to get through all of it. But a couple of things that stood out to me. North America, the sequential improvement in margins was certainly impressive and better than I was expecting. I haven\u2019t been able to get to the drivers in your Q yet, but can you give us any more color on what contributed to, I guess, the statement of year-on-year decline and the sequential uptick and whether or not just anything transitory aiding that? Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks. So, obviously, the North America had strong sequential improvement in margin, obviously, up around a couple of hundred basis points that you saw as we put it in the prepared remarks. Dollar sales growth is driving that and obviously good topline growth, a good consumption growth across our categories. I mentioned earlier, Jason, that at least the last 13 weeks we have seen share growth in eight of our 1 categories, which again, I think, is the result of obviously the execution results we are getting in the marketplace, the innovation, working our promotions effectively in the marketplace and some of the new products that we put in place. But, obviously, we are going to continue to focus on gross margin expansion across both North America and the company. Gross profit is the key focus. The funding the growth initiatives that we have in place, getting the mix right, getting the innovation right in Oral Care as we move through the back half of the year will be critically important. Supply chain was a contributor to that as well. Obviously, we have got some of those issues that are behind us, still a lot of pressure. We need to focus on logistics, which continues to be a real headwind for both North America and the company, and as we see opportunities in the back half, we will certainly look to take those. Jason English : Good stuff, Thanks a lot. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. So I will turn the conference back over to Noel Wallace for any closing remarks. Noel Wallace : Well, thanks everyone. Again, broad based growth across the company, executing and transferring knowledge across our core categories, we are seeing obviously good consumption. Obviously an unprecedented environment around pricing, we will continue to be focused on revenue growth management, our funding the growth initiatives and our global productivity initiative as we go into the back half. Thanks for the call this morning and we look forward to talk with everyone soon. Operator : And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Once, again, thanks everyone for joining us. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President, M&A, John Faucher. John Faucher : Thanks, Allison. Good morning and welcome to our 2022 third quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and related prepared materials and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with his thoughts on our Q3 results and our 2022 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. Noel? Noel Wallace : Thanks, John and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. We continue to execute our growth strategy as we deal with an operating environment that remains very volatile. In the third quarter, we delivered high single-digit organic sales growth with growth across every division. We also delivered growth in all four of our categories, including high single-digit growth in Oral Care, Pet Nutrition and Personal Care. I know elasticities are a big topic of conversation this quarter. While our volumes were negatively impacted by retailer inventory reductions and Hill\u2019s supply chain constraints in the quarter, underlying elasticity remained in line with our expectations and we would expect volume performance to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter as these headwinds abate. We delivered strong pricing growth through revenue growth management and healthy productivity through Funding the Growth and the initial benefits of our 2022 Global Productivity Initiative. This helped us drive a sequential improvement in gross margin in the third quarter despite further increases in raw material prices. The headwinds we face, whether from foreign exchange, raw and packaging materials and logistics costs or macroeconomic uncertainty are significant, but we believe we are well positioned to deal with these issues. We have taken the difficult steps necessary to meet these challenges head on through pricing, productivity, capital deployment and other actions. These actions leave us well positioned to benefit when our markets stabilize. The first reason is our portfolio. We have focused \u2013 we have a focused portfolio of leading brands in growing categories competing across multiple price tiers. Consumers use the vast majority of our products everyday : when they shower, when they clean their homes, when they feed their pets and hopefully, when they brush their teeth after every meal. We believe this high frequency of usage, combined with the strength of our brands, helped with our elasticities despite significant pricing. This has been particularly true in Oral Care and our categories generally have low private label market shares compared to many other HPC categories where we don\u2019t compete. Consumers look to trusted brands to provide value and we have built brands over time to deliver value to our customers and our consumers, particularly given our breadth of offerings across price tiers from entry level to ultra premium. And our professional recommendation model in several of our largest categories also helps to provide added value and differentiation to consumers, which builds brand loyalty. And we have high market shares with number one or number two positions in many of our key segments across all four of our categories. We are also well positioned because we are building capabilities and then scaling them across the company in order to drive growth both now and in the future. Our most important capabilities are focused on science-led innovation, particularly in a time when there is so much pricing in our categories, it is vital to add consumer identifiable value. You can see our progress here on brands like Colgate Optic White, Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet, EltaMD and many others. It is also helping to drive improvements in our market share trends. I spent a lot of time at Barclays talking about our digital transformation, an area that is impacting every facet of our business : our e-commerce performance, the ROI of our advertising, a digital-driven supply chain, the use of AI and new product development and even how we are doing our training around the world. Revenue growth management is another capability we are scaling across the organization. We are putting the full force and effort of our data and analytics team into our RGM planning. We believe this is also helping us to make RGM\u2019s decisions to help to lessen the impact of elasticities. So as we head into the Q&A, I want to reiterate that our strategy is working and through an environment that remains uncertain and volatile, we believe we are well positioned with strong brands, scaling capabilities and most importantly, great people. So I will turn it over to the Q&A now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead. Peter Grom : Hey, good morning everyone. I hope you are doing well. So I wanted to ask specifically on Hill\u2019s. Maybe first, is there a way you could potentially quantify the impact of the supply chain constraints and reductions in retail inventory had on organic sales in the quarter? And then maybe more importantly, I know you mentioned a return to double-digit organic sales growth in September, but can you maybe discuss why you remain confident in the acceleration in the business looking out to the fourth quarter and potentially longer term? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks Peter. Let me go back to the strategy. And I think as it underpins some of the \u2013 obviously, the supply chain constraints that we had earlier in the quarter, which is obviously based on really high demand for the brand. And we have had nine quarters of double-digit growth on that business with fundamentally the same supply chain network. So if you go back to the core elements of the strategy, really building science-driven innovation that we translate into claims for the consumer, claims for our vets and vet technicians that drives to endorsement of our brand. We translate that digitally across the enterprise run our e-commerce business ahead of general market shares. Ultimately, that is driving strong consumption. What happened in the early part of the quarter is the supply chain is obviously at 100% capacity, pre, obviously, the acquisitions of Red Collar and the acquisition that we made in Europe. We now have the ability to really free up capacity moving forward. We are going to be able to do a lot more efficient production in our existing facilities. We are transferring a lot of that volume into the new Red Collar facilities, which are coming upstream as of October. So we feel very good moving forward. And as you mentioned, we exited the quarter back in double-digit growth. So strong consumption in the business, shipments outpacing \u2013 excuse me, consumption, obviously, outpacing shipments and we feel very good about where we are in the next 3 to 6 months as we integrate the Red Collar acquisition and continue to operate our plants more efficiently in the existing network. Operator : Our next question today will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hi, good morning. So, obviously incredibly strong pricing in the quarter. We haven\u2019t seen that level of quarterly growth in decades. So it would be helpful just to understand what you are seeing competitively out there given such strong Colgate pricing. Are you content with price gaps? Are you generally seeing competitors follow or might there be adjustments that are needed as you think about that pricing line going forward? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes, good morning Eric. Thanks. Let\u2019s go back to, again, what we have been discussing all year. We took pricing obviously as we articulated in the second quarter, particularly across North America and other divisions. That pricing continued obviously in the third quarter. We have led pricing in many of our markets and that has been fundamental to the growth of the business right now. We believe it\u2019s critical to get the pricing into the P&L. We have now seen competitors begin to follow. So that should alleviate some of the volume pressure that we saw early in the quarter, but we feel very good about where we are with pricing. We obviously feel that the market will continue to hold that pricing as we see a very constructive market, as I have discussed in the past, with competition. Now competition was a little slow to follow, but we have seen that in the later end of the quarter that most of our competitors have followed in our core categories. So we feel pretty good. We talked about elasticities upfront. They are more or less in line with where we articulated at Barclays. We have seen a little bit more elasticity given the pricing that we took in some of the Home Care businesses. But again, we took Home Care pricing ahead of competition and competition is now following. So, we expect that to alleviate as we move forward. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we are. Obviously, foreign exchange is the new dynamic we are dealing with and having lots of discussions with the team on how to manage price volume moving forward, but we feel very good about where we are right now. Operator : Our next question today will come from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. So can you comment a bit on the pace of volumes exiting the quarter? I think you alluded to the fact that Hill\u2019s got better with the acquisition. I know it takes, you mentioned, 3 to 6 months. I just want to reconcile, Noel, your comment also on pricing that your competitors are following now and then you hope to alleviate. Should we expect like the way the quarter unfolded that volumes were not as bad as you exit the quarter? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Andrea. Volumes improved as we exited the quarter as we talked about, obviously some of the supply chain constraints upfront on Hill\u2019s. We talked about post Barclays, as you remember we saw some early warning signs in the online business on our trade partners taking inventory down. We had not seen it in brick and mortar at that stage, but we had communicated that, that\u2019s not to say that might happen towards the end of the quarter, which is exactly what happened. We saw some inventory come out in some of the key retailers in North America. We obviously saw continued reductions in inventory on Amazon throughout the quarter and that ultimately led to roughly 100 basis points of headwinds on the quarter. Take that with additional 50 basis points of Russia impact in the quarter and obviously some of the supply chain constraints. So, we feel good about volume sequentially improving in the fourth quarter. Obviously, consumption seems to be holding out, but we have to bear in mind that there is a lot of pricing going in the market across multiple categories. So we will continue to watch that very carefully. We have also obviously had to pull a little bit of the advertising back in the quarter as we saw consumption across most categories slowdown in Europe and obviously the constraints on Hill\u2019s. Hill\u2019s, we moved that money to the fourth quarter to continue to drive consumption and exit the year strongly. We do not want to be cutting investment. We believe this hopefully, some of these volatility is short term. Our focus is continue to invest behind the brands and drive consumption as we move into 2023. Operator : Our next question is going to come from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Chris Carey : Hi, good morning. Can you just perhaps comment on how you feel about gross margin progression, really pricing still coming in quite strong and the commodity impact actually worsened sequentially. But ultimately, commodities will ease going forward and into next year and presumably productivity remains a good story. So in the context of what you are seeing on the volume side, do you feel like you might need to reinvest back some to drive demand within promotions and perhaps that can reduce net pricing? But in general, it does feel like you are weathering quite a bit of commodity pressure here with pricing and these things are going to ease going forward. So I wonder if you could just give a sense on how you feel about gross margin progression over time? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. Let me just \u2013 I will take it conceptually and strategically the top and then let me turn it over to Stan to give you a little bit more color. Overall, strategically, as we talked about coming into the second quarter, we felt it was very important to get ahead of the inflationary environment and take as much pricing as we could. We watch that very carefully obviously with consumption. You combine that with the initiatives that we set out for 2022 with our Global Productivity Index. We felt it was very important to get ahead of this, which we announced back in 2021. And we are seeing that coming through on the gross profit line, obviously, gross profit up sequentially in the quarter despite 920 points of headwind in the gross margin reconciliation. So we feel that was important to get that in and we will continue to take pricing as necessary. Raw materials, I will turn it over to Stan to give you a flavor of where those are right now. We have seen a little bit of pullback, but more or less, we are still seeing significant increases versus where we were last year. Stan? Stan Sutula : Yes. So we have seen some modest movement in materials cost. But overall, we continue to see raw materials as a full year 2022 as $1.3 billion full year increase. As a reminder, that\u2019s 23% year-to-year. In the third quarter, as Noel highlighted, it was 920 points, so a little bit of color underneath that. Oil has generally been lower since our last call, but now has kind of creep back to where it was then. We have seen ag as an offset here. It increased versus our previous guidance, particularly around proteins, corn, etcetera and those are notably higher versus where we were in July. Partially offsetting that, we have seen palm oil has actually come in a decent amount. Now, that\u2019s favorable, but tallow, soybean and other oils are still showing elevated levels of inflation. So, that\u2019s what keeps us at the $1.3 billion for the year. As a reminder, we lock in, so typically and this quarter is no exception, we are largely locked in for fourth quarter. Now one of the common \u2013 while natural gas is not a raw material per se, we do use it to power our plants, particularly in Europe. And that\u2019s been volatile and continues to escalate. So as we expected, raw materials continue to move, but overall, still see $1.3 billion. And this is why we have our GPI program, our Funding the Growth program as we look to take productivity to mitigate that 920 point headwind. Operator : Our next question today will come from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Thanks, operator. Good morning. Stan maybe if I could just pick up on the last question. Can you just give us a sense of just given how volatile maybe raw material costs have been, are you locking in or hedging further out? And as we begin to kind of look at 2023, is there \u2013 how far ahead are you in terms of being locked in on raw material costs for \u201823? Stan Sutula : Yes. Thanks for the question, Bryan. So as we look, we\u2019ve seen the volatility. While we\u2019ve had movement up and down, the $1.3 billion is exactly the same number we highlighted out of last quarter. So while we\u2019ve seen components move up and down, we\u2019ve only seen modest movement on a net basis. We typically lock in the next quarter, and then we do, do some longer-term pricing into that, mock that in out quarters. But it\u2019s relatively modest. As you\u2019d expect, the near quarter gets the most, and then it kind of scales down. But today, we\u2019re not going to give 2023 guidance. What we are looking at is the movement that we see. We\u2019re trying to make sure we\u2019re very prudent on not locking in areas that we think are going to moderate over time. And then we don\u2019t do a lot of hedging. So we do some in the ag space, but we don\u2019t do a lot of hedging among the others. We think price is the ultimate hedge. Operator : Our next question will come from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in. A couple of quick questions I\u2019ll try to squeeze in. So back to the $1.3 billion inflation, our quick math suggests that implies a reasonable amount of moderation in the fourth quarter. Still inflation, but certainly less than what we\u2019ve been seeing in the last two quarters. A, is that right? And secondly, in your Q, you give round numbers on percentage of sales by category. And I know they are round numbers. So there can be a lot of variability there. But it does suggest that you\u2019re seeing year-on-year declines in your Personal Care and Home Care categories. Can you just maybe elaborate a little bit on what you\u2019re seeing within those individual categories? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes. Let me take the categories first, and then I\u2019ll let Stan provide a little bit more color on the raw materials and where we see the fourth quarter. Categories, by and large, are where we estimated. Obviously, we\u2019ve seen a little pullback in the Home Care categories, but Personal Care, Oral Care and Pet Nutrition continue to be quite healthy, particularly given the pricing that\u2019s going into the category. Relative to year-on-year, I mean, all of our categories in terms of how we play them are up. There may be some impact from foreign exchange there, Jason. But other than that, we see good growth across a broad nature of our categories. Stan Sutula : And on the raw materials, Jason, we said in our last call that we thought this is going to peak in Q3. We continue to believe that. So while the full year still holds at $1.3 billion, we do expect some slight moderation in Q4. And again, we\u2019re largely locked in for that. Noel Wallace : Yes. The one area I\u2019d add is ag prices and some of the specialty ingredients that we use in Science Diet and Prescription Diet, those continue to be quite high. So we\u2019re watching those quite carefully as we move into \u201823. Operator : Our next question today will come from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kevin Grundy : Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Wanted to pivot, Noel, ask a question on portfolio strategy, two parts to it. The first one, the overall level of satisfaction with the portfolio. As you sit here today, any updated thoughts on where you potentially would want to augment through M&A. And the second part, as it pertains to Hill\u2019s, which is a business which has done extraordinarily well here recently, there is a view in the marketplace there is potentially some latent value in the Colgate portfolio, specifically related to that business. Love to get your thoughts there, perhaps remind us of the Board\u2019s approach to portfolio assessment. Thanks for that. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks for the question. In a world of significant volatility, we are really pleased with the diversity of the categories we compete in. They are carefully curated categories. We\u2019re highly focused on four. As you all know, we\u2019ve been focused on four for a long, long time. We have deep understanding in those four categories. We believe they are well constructed and well positioned for future growth whether you\u2019re looking at consumption opportunities, whether you\u2019re looking at price-driven opportunities in terms of premiumization. And obviously, they are all not going to run in tandem. And we\u2019ve obviously done some great things in the Pet Nutrition categories. We\u2019ve pivoted a lot of that strategy over the last 4 years, and you\u2019ve seen the success of that. You\u2019ve seen the success in this year as we\u2019re driving broad-based growth across all of our categories, which I talked about initially. Very happy with skin health. Obviously, the professional skin business in the U.S. continues to perform very well. Yes, the Filorga business in China continues to be a challenge, given the lockdowns we\u2019ve seen in China and the lack of travel of Chinese consumers around the world. But overall, we feel the ebb and flow of our categories is exactly where we want to be right now. And we feel very fortunate that we\u2019re very focused on four, and all those categories are growing today. Operator : Our next question will come from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Great. Great, thank you. My question was more around expenses. First on commodities and raw mat, is it possible to kind of parse out how much currency played a part versus inflation on a constant currency basis? And then on advertising, if you could just give a little bit more color. It sounded like most of that was related to the disruption in Hill\u2019s. Just a little bit more color in terms of your ongoing expectations, particularly in sort of the digital aspect, given what we\u2019ve heard from some of the digital advertisers. Thank you. Noel Wallace : So let me start with the expenses piece. So on raw materials, obviously, we operate in over 200 countries and territories. So as you think about the currency impact on our overall portfolio, that also impacts our raw materials. So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s outsized in any particular one. Some materials are sourced from one or two suppliers, so they\u2019ll have an outsized impact while others are sourced locally. And those have a natural hedge, if you will, from a currency aspect. So FX, as you think about the impact to raw materials, you should think about that largely in line with the impact of the overall company, and that will vary slightly by division. Stan Sutula : On advertising, Olivia, you heard us say that on a dollar basis, we were down about 3%, but on a local currency basis, we were up 2%. So overall, we still feel good with the impact we\u2019re having in the markets. We\u2019ve done a lot of work, as others have done, to really optimize our spending with obviously a move of 50-plus of our spending now, 50% plus of our spend in digital. We\u2019re able to get much more deep into the analytics and the ROI metrics. We\u2019re doing a much better job at personalizing our content. As I\u2019ve talked about before, over 40,000 people around the world on our digital transformation, media being an important part of that. So we feel we\u2019re getting much better. We pulled back a little in Europe as we saw a pretty significant drop off in the categories. And so we wanted to be prudent as we thought about investment moving forward. And as I mentioned earlier, we pulled back a little bit in the third quarter at Hill\u2019s, but transferred that money into the fourth quarter to continue to drive consumption as we bring on more capacity. Operator : Our next question will come from Callum Elliott of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Callum Elliott : Hi, thanks for the question. Another portfolio question, if that\u2019s okay. I just wanted to ask you, can you talk please about the operational integration of the Oral Care business with the Personal Care and Home Care businesses, and specifically with a view to how difficult would it be to separate parts of or all of Personal Care, Home Care, if you were to change about the value of those Personal Care, Home Care businesses to the overall company? Noel Wallace : Yes. What I\u2019m going to do is step back again and talk about the strategy of the company and why it\u2019s working. And I think the results today illustrate that our growth strategies across all of our businesses and how we integrate those businesses and scale our capabilities are delivering strong performance for the overall business, 15 quarters now of organic sales growth within our 3% to 5% target range. We\u2019ve had growth in every division in all four of our categories. And we\u2019re particularly pleased, obviously, this quarter with high single-digit growth in Oral Care, our Personal Care business as well as our Pet Nutrition business. A key part of that strategy, which I think gets to the heart of your question, is how we\u2019re leveraging our capabilities across the enterprise. We\u2019ve talked about our science-driven approach, clinical substantiation for our products that drive claims, consumer acceptance, drive \u2013 lead to professional endorsement. As you know, we have a strong professional model across our pet business, our Oral Care business as well as our skin health business. We\u2019re leveraging those learnings. In fact, over the last 1.5 years, we put an organization in New York simply to look at how we continue to optimize and sharpen our professional strategies as we see brand recommended most often is a key driver of saliency for the brands and the equities and ultimately loyalty. Our digital transformation largely initially led by Hill\u2019s. We have now taken their capabilities, their talent and use those across the entire enterprise to further our digital capabilities. You\u2019ve seen our e-commerce business is one of the fastest-growing channel businesses that we have today. Our market shares in markets like China, which is the biggest e-commerce market, are outdelivering against any other competitor in the market. And we really attribute that to leveraging the scalability of certain capabilities across the enterprise. So again, we like the four categories we compete in, a lot of similarities, a lot of overlap. And we continue to see that executed in terms of the results that we\u2019ve delivered today. Stan Sutula : One thing I\u2019d add there, I think, is that integration extends to our supply chain. One of our key attributes here is the production that we do across the world. And we integrate that particularly across Personal Care, Home Care and Oral Care, and that gives us a lot of leverage. Operator : Our next question today will come from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess two things. First off is you\u2019ve commented quite a bit on elasticity and feeling \u2013 saying it\u2019s very much in line. And I think you\u2019ve done a nice job calling out Hill\u2019s and then the inventory destocking in North America. But one thing that jumped out to me was just the volume performance in Latin America. So if you could just give \u2013 from other companies, I think we\u2019ve kind of seen what looks like a bit better resiliency in the face of pricing. So just curious if you could offer some more detail on Latin America? And secondly, I was just curious on your view broadly on inflation in grocery into 2023. How much more space do you think there is for incremental pricing across your portfolio? Is it terribly different domestically versus internationally? I\u2019d just be curious for some perspective on that as well. Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Lauren. Let me talk to Latin America. In fact, I just got back from trips to Brazil and Mexico. So the information is very fresh. You saw the 20% pricing that we took in Latin America, obviously, following significant pricing in the second quarter, about 12.5. And as I mentioned upfront, we have led in pricing across all of our categories in Latin America. And as a result of leading, it took time for the others to catch up. And obviously, you got elasticity when the others haven\u2019t catch up is going to be a little bit higher. As we exited the quarter, we started to see volumes improve, particularly across Personal Care and Oral Care. Home Care, a little slow to recover, but we will see \u2013 I think we will see that stabilize as we move forward. But overall, the plans I saw in place in both Brazil and Mexico were really, really strong. Shares, very good in Brazil, a little soft in Mexico, particularly in Oral Care, given the fact that we took aggressive pricing competition follow initially. As I was leaving those markets, competition followed. So we feel pretty good as we move into the fourth quarter and into 2023. And the innovation plans that we have in place and the premiumization plans we have in place in Latin America look really, really strong. In fact, in both Mexico and Brazil, we have seen our share of the premium segment grow sequentially over the last five quarters, six quarters. So we feel good about where we are there. We\u2019re also, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, the importance of our core businesses, relaunching some of our core businesses to ensure that if we do see trade down and we continue to provide value at the opening price point, we\u2019re there for that consumer, so overall, feeling good about Latin America as we move into the fourth quarter and in 2023. Relative to inflation moving forward, listen, I think everyone is going to deal with that how they see fit. We will continue to take pricing. I think the key aspect for us is continuing to invest behind brand building. And that brand building ultimately allows us to take more pricing in the markets around the world and continue to drive value to our consumers. Now we will see where the competition goes. If inflation becomes more benign, which I think most people expect it to be, we will watch that carefully. But the pricing environment has been to now very constructive. And we anticipate that as we can bring stronger innovation into the market, continue to invest behind our brands, we will minimize the elasticity. Is there more opportunity in grocery? Absolutely. We will see that as it comes to fruition. But right now, we feel good about where we have taken pricing and particularly the plans we have in place to minimize elasticity. Operator : Our next question will come from Kaumil Gajrawala of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hi guys. Good morning. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about Europe? Obviously, we can see the delivery in the quarter, but an area where inflation might be the most acute is also an area where the consumer might be under the most amount of pressure. So, maybe if you can just talk about your outlook for Europe, particularly as we are going into the winter? Noel Wallace : Yes. You are right. I mean Europe is certainly under the most pressure, particularly around energy pricing. We have taken significant pricing in Europe as others have. It\u2019s \u2013 as you go back and look at that in history, it\u2019s the most pricing that\u2019s gone into the business in quite some time. Importantly, we have a good mix of price points covered in Europe. The strength of our Elmex and our Meridol brands, obviously, at the premium side, and Colgate, obviously more in the mainstream, you have seen the combination of those two businesses grow share in the quarter and in the year. So, we feel good about where we are. As I mentioned earlier, I think consistently across the world, a little bit more elasticity in the home care businesses. But we have got some pretty significant re-launches coming in early 2023 on our home care businesses. So, we feel good about the plans in place we have in order to continue to drive consumption there. So, overall, it\u2019s going to be a tough winter. We are going to watch that very closely. We feel we have got a good mix of brands at different price points to deal with the significant inflation that consumer is going to have to deal with. But obviously, a tough six months ahead of the Europeans. Operator : Our next question today will come from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore. Please go ahead. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. Just a couple of sort of follow-up questions. On the inventory side, the retail adjustments, is that \u2013 are you confident that\u2019s done at this point? And is there anything on the e-commerce side where there could be adjustments in terms of e-commerce-related inventories? And then second, can you give us any more details on China? We talked about that a lot in the past. How are you doing there? How are the market share trends? And how is that market starting to reopen? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes. Good morning Rob. Thanks. On the inventory adjustments, obviously, we saw quite a bit come out towards the end of the quarter. Is it done, we can\u2019t make that prediction. We follow these inventories, as I mentioned, I think on the second quarter call or up at Barclays to the day. I mean particularly with our big customers, we work very much in collaboration with them on the guidance and goals that they have. Invariably, what happens is they may take democratic decisions across all the categories if they are reducing inventories, and we deal with that unexpectedly towards the end of the quarter. We obviously are staying very close to case builds and on-shelf availability and communicating that back as necessary. The last thing they want to do is obviously run out of stocks, particularly with our portfolio, which are significant traffic drivers across the categories in which we compete. So, is it done, it\u2019s hard to say. It is below where they historically have managed their inventories. That usually means that they will bring them back to those levels or something closer, but we will have to watch that very carefully. It\u2019s very difficult for me to predict. A great quarter for China, we have talked about China over the last 2 years in terms of the transformation of our strategy on the ground, which was significant from our entire go-to-market to some of our marketing and innovation plans. We have seen our e-commerce continue to be one of the fastest-growing e-commerce brands in the market. We have seen our brick-and-mortar business stabilize over the last couple of quarters, which is terrific. You saw the growth that we delivered the last two quarters for greater were greater \u2013 our Greater China region, we delivered positive pricing and positive volume across our enterprise. We had the Hawley & Hazel, the Darlie re-launch has gone into effect. This is a significant, significant re-launch for the brand, changing the brand name. That\u2019s been quite successful. Our Colgate business continues to track well. So, overall, we feel good. Now no question, the lockdowns are having an impact. The lockdowns have had a significant impact on our Filorga business. They have had a significant impact on some of our premium brands as we have seen those typically translate into slower online sales. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we are. We will see where the lockdowns go. That will open up the market. And as that comes back to a more stable predictability, we feel good about where we are and what we built in terms of capabilities on the ground during a very difficult 18 months. Operator : Our next question will come from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge. Please go ahead. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning. Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow-up about your thoughts about big picture about promotional efficacy. The big debate is how much \u2013 I know you talked about everybody is wondering how much promotion is going to come back structurally. But I wanted to dig in and any comment you could have about are more people \u2013 people have gotten trained off of buying on deals. So, now a little bit more promos coming back in. It\u2019s a little bit more little-by-little anyway. How is promotional \u2013 is promotional efficacy where you are promoting working better or worse than your expectations, particularly in, say, North America and Europe, developed markets? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes. Jonathan, thanks for the question. Clearly, I think as the consumer becomes more strapped relative to inflation, they will be more astute in looking at promotions. I can characterize at least where promotional volumes are, particularly for North America. And it would be somewhat a generalized consensus for the rest of the world. Our promotional volumes are slightly down year-to-date. That was deliberately \u2013 deliberate. We have pulled back on some aggressive couponing that can drive volume, but doesn\u2019t do much for your P&L. We have seen some of our competitors follow that strategy, not all of them. I would say our two key competitors have taken their promotions up a little bit in the U.S. But you saw the U.S. numbers, at least our consumption continues to be very strong. In North America, we were up or flat in 8 of our 12 categories. Our toothpaste business and toothbrush business continue to perform quite well with share growth. And we have done that with good innovation and pulling back a little bit on promotion. Now, where does it go moving forward, I think promotions will be sharply managed by the categories and by our competitors. And we will have to watch that very carefully. But clearly, I think you would expect to see a little bit more volume sold on promotion moving forward, returning to much more normalized levels given the fact that the trade and our competitors will be looking to drive a little bit more volume in the categories. But we are going to watch that very carefully. Again, I think it comes down to your ability to leverage your portfolio effectively. A lot of the work that we have done in revenue growth management really gets to the heart of that on how to balance entry price point, mid-price point and premium price points in order to drive value to the category and to our customers and ultimately giving the consumer a good proposition to take home. Operator : Our next question will come from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Nik Modi : Yes. Thank you. Good morning everyone. Noel, I was just hoping you can reconcile the inventory destocking dynamic. I am just thinking about fill rates are recovering. At the same time, the categories in which you play are high frequency. So, is this just a broader retailer decision based on dollar-based inventory that they are holding across the store, or is purchase frequency, let\u2019s say, within oral care, people are squeezing a little extra out of their tube, and the purchase cycles are getting a little wider. Any perspective around that would be helpful. Noel Wallace : Sure. Trips are down, but starting to turn a little bit. We are not seeing significant changes in, obviously, household penetration across our categories. Consumers may be losing a little bit less. We will have to watch that moving forward. The basic driver in volume has been just more deliberate shifts in some of our trade partners trying to manage their costs, particularly as they see discretionary items slow. They have had to look at, obviously, their full basket of inventory and take inventory down more, quite frankly, across the enterprise. We watch, as I mentioned upfront, very, very carefully with our trade partners. We watch out of stocks. Our case fills are all back up, obviously, looking good across the business with the exception of the early supply chain constraints we had on Hill\u2019s, as I mentioned. But we feel good about where we are from that standpoint, which gives us a lot more visibility and a lot more confidence as we deal with our trade partners to give them what they need. Again, predicting what they are going to do towards the end of the quarter becomes difficult. But I think as these things stabilize, inventories stay down at these levels, the trade will look to high velocity categories is their first priority to take back up because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive traffic in their stores. Operator : Our next question will come from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Thanks and good morning everyone. Just a few questions for me. One, could you just comment on what global volume growth would be in your categories? Second, just maybe remind us thoughts about pricing, particularly in pets, if there is any sort of deflation? And then just more broadly on pricing, how are you thinking about maintaining the pricing that you have taken? What would be the expectation for that retention? And has there been any sort of change from a retailer standpoint in terms of your discussions about taking or retaining? And maybe if you could talk a bit \u2013 I know some of the questions were talking about that domestically, but maybe if you could talk on a global basis, your perspective, that would be helpful. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Yes. Global categories, we are tracking today around 3% to 4%, maybe a little shy of that in volumes, but value more or less 3% to 4%. And obviously, as pricing goes into the market, you see the ebbs and flows there. But overall, we expect volumes to recover. We do think purchase cycles, as I mentioned earlier, will get a little bit more elongated. Consumers will watch their consumption and their pantries quite carefully. We have seen \u2013 we watch the pantry inventories. We have seen a little bit of that come down, but that\u2019s to be expected. But overall, I mean we are looking at global category growth in the 3% to 4% range. And obviously, we are growing above that generally around the world. And so that obviously leads to better consumption on our categories or at least better shares. In terms of pricing in the categories, our ability to retain that, that depends largely, quite frankly, on our innovation and the value proposition we are bringing to consumers. And we have spent a lot of time. It\u2019s not just taking pricing. There is a lot of re-launches into that RGM strategy that we have been talking about to ensure that across all price points, we are adding value to the consumer, something new and different for them to continue to use our brands and see longevity in terms of the interest they have in our equities. And so we have been very careful to ensure that it\u2019s not just straight pricing that we are bringing value, whether it\u2019s through price pack architecture, through better innovation in terms of science-driven claims, etcetera, etcetera. Specifically on Hill\u2019s, I think it\u2019s very much about the innovation strategy that we have, the Derm Complete launch, significant innovation. The obesity diets that we have, significant innovation in the market. So, that drives real value with the consumer that we can communicate and justify the price increases that we have. So, we will continue to execute against that strategy, and we will watch the categories carefully as we balance volume and price moving forward. Operator : The last question will come from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Well. Great. Thanks. I actually want to go back to Europe, and you spoke about this a bit, but I guess I was getting a question just like a little more perspective on your outlook on European profitability and whether or not you thought it is going to get worse before it gets better or whether or not you saw improvement on the horizon. And maybe as part of that, I guess I was also curious what you are seeing from some of your European-based competitors, which are obviously on the other side of the FX wall here and how that may be playing into pricing considerations and competitive considerations perhaps in Europe as a headwind to profitability or maybe it\u2019s \u2013 or maybe more globally? Noel Wallace : Yes. Europe had a good quarter. Obviously, this has been an incredible undertaking to get that level of pricing in the P&L. You haven\u2019t seen that, quite frankly, in a long, long time. And I think it plays out \u2013 plays back to a lot of the work and the focus that we have had around revenue growth management. Europe is doing an extraordinary job. Steve, you know the trade there can be difficult, but we have seen a lot of good opportunities to take pricing in the categories. It\u2019s also, I think underscored the ability to bring real new news to the categories, and we are doing that across the board. We have strong brands in oral care in Europe. Obviously, Meridol and Elmex at the premium side of the business continue to grow in this environment despite the fact that we have led on pricing. So, we feel pretty good about where we are. I again mentioned that the home care business across the world is the challenge, and we are taking a very deeper look at exactly what we need to do to ensure we continue to drive more volume in those categories. We have got strong businesses in home care in Europe, and we need to be mindful of that. I will mention, I guess as a point private label. Private label, down across all our categories in North America. In market shares, you have seen it inch up, but you would expect a little bit more in Europe. So, we are going to have to watch that. This is a market that will be challenged in the next six months, given the inflationary pressures they are under that everyone is well aware of. And we are thinking very carefully about how to continue to execute successfully. The key is getting pricing in the P&L, which allows us \u2013 the leverage that we need to do the things that we need to do moving forward. Operator : This concludes the Q&A portion of our call. I will now return the call to Noel Wallace, Colgate\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, for any closing remarks. End of Q&A: Noel Wallace : Yes. Well, thanks everyone and good questions. I want to come back to just a couple of concluding remarks. As you have seen, I think our strategy continues to pay off. The broad-based growth is encouraging, all four categories, all six divisions, the innovation stream that we are putting in the market, that\u2019s a testament to a lot of the changes we have made in innovation over the last couple of years, that\u2019s driving premiumization and making sure we sustain our strong core businesses, particularly at the entry level. The digital transformation is having a profound impact on how we operate around the world, how we drive RGM, how we drive content. So, we think we have a well positioned portfolio moving forward. The most important and I am really proud of how our team has executed the strategy to deliver the continued organic sales growth. There has been a tremendous amount of headwinds against the business, but we have now delivered 15 straight quarters of either in line or above our 3% to 5% target. And this quarter was 7% organic, is a terrific quarter. And we are very proud of the work that the teams on the ground are doing. So, with that, I wish all of you a healthy and safe end of the year. And I look forward to speaking to you in January. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President, M&A, John Faucher. John Faucher : Thanks, Allison. Good morning. And welcome to our 2022 fourth quarter and full year earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and related prepared materials, and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables eight and nine of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with his thoughts on our Q4 results and our 2023 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. Noel? Noel Wallace : Thanks, John, and thank you all for joining us this morning and I wish all of you a very Happy New Year. So I mostly wanted to focus on the year ahead today, as I think we are well positioned to deliver strong results in 2023, even as we plan for a difficult macroeconomic environment and continued uncertainty. That said, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are pleased with the progress we made in 2022. We delivered organic sales growth in all four of our categories, including double-digit organic sales growth in Pet Nutrition and high single-digit organic growth in Oral Care. 2022 was our fourth straight year of delivering organic sales growth either in line or ahead of our 3% to 5% long-term target range and we delivered within or ahead of that range in every quarter over that time period, 16 consecutive quarters in all. And is the continuing strengthening of our strategy that has allowed us to grow consistently through different operating environments, as each year has presented its own challenges and its opportunities. But if we stay focused on driving the core, leveraging our capabilities across our portfolio, innovating in faster growth adjacencies and tapping into faster growth channels and markets, we will continue to grow. And in 2023, as we continue to execute on our strategy, we expect to accelerate earnings growth and generate incremental cash flow to drive shareholder value. Why are we well positioned for this year despite all of the uncertainty in the world today? It starts with our portfolio. We operate in four highly focused categories. Growing categories that consumers use every day and where they look to trusted brands to help themselves and their pets lead healthier lives. The focus on healthier lives means these consumers are motivated by science-driven innovation with professional endorsement, which is an area of particular strength for us. And the importance of trust in our categories helps keep private label penetration relatively low and allows for premiumization behind differentiated benefits. And within these categories, we have strong market shares. With most of our revenues coming from brands that have a number one or number two market shares on a global basis. The second reason is our focus on building, sharing and scaling capabilities to drive growth. I will continue to talk about our digital transformation as it impacts everything we do. This year we benefited from continued efficiencies in our digital media spending through data-driven modeling. Our efforts on innovation need to deliver over the long-term, not just the launch year, and we have shifted our resources to deliver more breakthrough and transformational innovation. In our prepared commentary, we talked about the share gains we are seeing in the whitening segment of the toothpaste category. It\u2019s a long-term strategy of launching Optic White Renewal and then Optic White Pro Series in the U.S. or our new MPS whitening technology where we are launching around the world, which leverages our superior R&D capabilities to drive long-term share growth. And on top of that, we continue to launch at-home whitening and professional whitening products to enhance our credibility and expand our presence in the premium segment. And our focus on building revenue growth management capabilities, particularly through increased use of data and analytics is driving our pricing growth in ways beyond just list price increases. And the third reason is our strong balance sheet. Our combined financial resources provide us the flexibility to reinvest in our portfolio or pursue value-enhancing acquisitions like our pet food acquisitions, which enables us to drive faster growth. The final reason we are well positioned is the efforts we have put into offsetting the extraordinary cost increases we have seen over the past several years. We have driven consistent pricing and we look to take additional pricing in the first half of this year. Our Funding the Growth program delivered another strong year in 2022 and we expect even higher levels of savings in 2023. We announced our global productivity initiative one year ago and we began to see the benefits in our numbers in the second half of 2022. We expect even greater savings in 2023 to help fund investment and drive operating margin expansion. So we believe we are well prepared for 2023, but there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty in the world. The macroeconomic environment outlook remains volatile, which can impact consumer spending. China remains a question mark as the country emerges from COVID lockdowns. While raw materials and foreign exchange remain headwinds, they look less onerous now. But as we learned last year, that can change quickly. So we head into 2023 with topline momentum and a proven strategy, with the right brands, the right capabilities and the right efficiency drivers to deliver topline growth and improve our bottomline performance. And with that, I will turn it over to the questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. I just wanted to touch on the organic sales growth guidance for next year coming off a strong Q4 result and the strong pricing we are seeing. I am assuming more than all of that perhaps is driven by pricing and volumes will be down slightly, A, maybe is that correct, and then B, it just be helpful to get a bit of commentary on each of those areas. What are you seeing from a competitive standpoint on the pricing front, and then B, as you think about volume and the demand elasticity you are seeing from a consumer standpoint to pricing, any changes sequentially at all and how are you feeling about that front heading into 2023 here? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks, Dara. Good morning. So, again, let\u2019s recap quickly, obviously, the strong topline growth or organic growth that we have seen across the business. We are very pleased, obviously, with finishing the year with strong momentum. Obviously, the pricing that we put into the P&L, particularly if you look on a two-year stack basis up to 15.5%, so sequentially up as we moved out of the quarter. So we have continued to take a lot of pricing and we will continue to see the benefits of that as we move into 2023. Volume continues to be a challenge across the world, as you have heard, I think, throughout the earnings season, categories have pulled back and that\u2019s expected given the magnitude of pricing that we have seen go into all geographies around the world. Our sense is will see continued pricing in the first half of this year, which we think will have a drag on volumes for the categories that we have seen particularly in the back half of this year, but that will begin to improve in the second half of the year. .  I think the other aspect on the organic guidance is really a question mark on the economic vibrance of the various markets around the world. We have seen Europe obviously under significant pressure with double-digit inflation. Categories have been soft. Elasticity is a little bit higher in Europe than the rest of the world. Obviously, China is a big question mark. Infection rates remain high. Yeah, a lot of euphoria about China reopening, but as you have seen in the fourth quarter, volumes have been very soft in China for the categories in which we compete, and we see that continuing, quite frankly, in the first quarter, that will improve as we move through the back half of the year to be sure. But that will bring, I think, a question mark to everyone in terms of uncertainty on where China goes and the impact that has. Pricing will need to continue to go through the categories in the first half of this year. As we announced in the prepared remarks, we will be taking more pricing and there\u2019s a real question mark, given the magnitude of the pricing that we have seen in the back half of 2022 and the pricing implementation in 2023, the impact that we will have on the consumer. So far, if I give an overarching comment to elasticities, they have been very much in line with where we have expected. So, overall, we think we feel good about the organic range. We feel very confident that we are within that range and if things continue to stay where they are and we continue to see the share growth that we are seeing across the world and the response to our innovation, hopefully we could be at the top end of that range or better. Operator : Our next question today will come from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you and Happy New Year to you too. So I have a broader question on volumes. On the minus 4% globally, which compares, I guess, favorably to some of your competitors that reported so far. What was the impact of retail destocking, if any, in Filorga. I mean I appreciate you put it in the prepared remarks, obviously impacted more Europe. So I was wondering if you can kind of breach that gap. And also a good segue from your last comments, Noel, on Europe, you have said obviously more pressured. What are the -- and I understand that it was mostly Personal Care and hand soap. Is there anything you can add to that in terms of like the exit rate and also the exit rate for China? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Andrea. Good morning. So let me talk a little bit about volume performance around the world and more sequentially as we went through the quarter. Volume improved in the fourth quarter versus third quarter and that volume improvement came despite obviously an incremental point of advertising, excuse me, of pricing, which you saw at 12.5%. So, overall, we are pretty pleased. Some of the drawbacks on volume, as we discussed in the prepared remarks, obviously, skin health had a challenging quarter from inventory reductions, particularly in the online world. We saw those inventory reductions, particularly here in the North America business, and obviously, a significant inventory and volume softness in China due to COVID on the Filorga business. So that really pulled down quite a bit of the volume. You obviously have the Russia impact, which we would quantify to roughly around 30 basis points. Elasticity, as I mentioned early on, were very much in line and consistent around the world, slightly higher elasticities in Europe, but that should be expected and consistent with history, but very much in line with where we expected. A little bit more inventory reduction in India than we expected, particularly in the rural as the rural business has not come back nearly as quickly as we anticipated in the fourth quarter. We expect that, though, to come back in 2023. So, overall, that was very much driven by some inventory reductions we saw on skin, a little bit in the drug classic [ph] trade in the U.S. Likewise, the softness that we saw -- a continued softness we saw in the China skincare business. But, overall, volumes improved versus the third quarter and to a certain extent, more or less where we expected. We did not expect a further deceleration of inventory pullback in the U.S. on the skin business. So in terms of exit rates for Europe, if I characterize Europe in general, a strong share growth across the Board and mid-to-high single-digit organic sales growth in Oral Care and in Home Care, which as you rightfully pointed out, was offset by the weakness in Personal Care, which was principally Filorga, China. But, overall, shares are strong in Europe. We seem to be getting our pricing through. Negotiations continue to go quite well. However, categories have been rather soft in Europe given the amount of pricing that, that market has experienced and the sheer inflation that the European economies are incurring today. So, overall, I feel pretty good about Europe. The good news is the shares are strong and we are getting the pricing through and we feel we are set up for a good year in 2023. Operator : Our next question will come from Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hi. Good morning. On your commentary on shares\u2026 Noel Wallace : Good morning, Kaumil. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hi. On your commentary on share, you seem quite pleased with share trends. Can you maybe just dig into that a little bit volume versus value, are your shares -- do your shares look -- are you equally as happy with your share in volume terms as opposed to in value? Noel Wallace : Sure. I just characterized Europe, where we felt very good about where we ended up, particularly in Oral Care. North America, as you have seen the data, we are up or flat in eight to 12 categories. Importantly, good -- very strong Oral Care growth both in the year and in the quarter, so pretty good there. Latin America shares in general are flat and we feel good about where we are from a Latin America standpoint, given the sheer amount of pricing that we have taken. I think that\u2019s a representative of some of the strong innovation that we put into the market in the back half. Asia, I will characterize it as quite strong, particularly the e-commerce business, a little softness in the brick-and-mortar business. But, overall, e-commerce continues to perform very, very well and Africa, Middle East, strong as well. So, overall, we feel very good about the momentum we have had on market shares in value terms. Volume pretty much consistent with that, a little softer, particularly in Europe on the volume side in terms of our volume shares, and that\u2019s, I think, response to just the sheer amount of pricing that we have taken in that market. And as I mentioned earlier, obviously, a little softness in the Asian markets on volume, a lot of value going through those markets in general in the categories has been quite soft, but our volume shares in Asia seem to be holding up okay. Operator : The next question is from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Chris Carey : Hi. Good morning. Noel Wallace : Good morning. Chris Carey : Noel, if I just take your comments around some incremental pricing, I think, you said, productivity is expected to accelerate, if I look at raw material outlook of several hundred million of inflation and Red Collar, the gross margin negative impact should be easing sequentially. I am coming up with potentially significant gross margin expansion and I realize reality is often so much different than what we can see in the models. But I wonder if you can just maybe help frame that a bit more for me, because it does imply maybe you are leaving some room for investment. But, again, perhaps, I am missing something in this -- in the development of the key drivers here and I wonder if you could just help clarify that a bit more for me? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Let me take the kind of strategically how we position the P&L particularly around growth and investment and then I will let Stan take you through some of the constructs on how we built internally gross margin and operating margins. As you rightly said, we are really pleased with the operating margin improvement that we are seeing moving through the P&L and that will continue allowing us to fund more advertisers. So as the prepared remarks indicated, we intend to continue to invest behind the business and we have seen great response to the strategy that we have executed over the last couple of years. Obviously, the core adjacencies and channels behind increased investment is driving very strong organic growth in the category and up 5% dollar in the quarter despite significant foreign exchange headwinds. We talked obviously through the back half of this year, the need to continue to invest in Hill\u2019s business once we had more capacity coming online, and that has obviously started to happen in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to obviously continue as we move into 2023. So we will continue to accelerate our investments in the Hill\u2019s business in order to reap the benefits of the incremental capacity that we have. Good momentum on Oral Care and strong innovation and a lot of pricing that we have taken across a broad section of categories and we want to ensure that we have the investment there to generate to get the pricing seated in the marketplace and continue to drive consumption growth for our retailers. So, overall, it will be another year of good investment, a good share growth we expected, and obviously, good topline growth coming through the P&L. Let me turn it over to Stan to kind of take you through how we bridged some of the aspects around gross margin and operating margin. Stan Sutula : Sure. Thanks, Noel. And on gross profit margin, you started to see some progress, right? North America, Latin America and Africa, Eurasia, you saw improvements in the operating margin in the fourth quarter. As we look at gross profit, Noel, highlighted the pricing, that significant flow-through will help in 2022. The productivity will be a tailwind here and while material and Ranpak in particular will still be a headwind that moderates coming off of 2022. So, as you look at gross profit margin expansion, that\u2019s going to be a benefit. But keep in mind, as you work down, we are going to have investments in advertising. We expect to increase that on a dollars and percent of sales. But also keep in mind, as you go down the income statement that interest expense is going to be up year-to-year. That\u2019s driven predominantly by increase in rates and also by slightly increased debt levels as we carry Red Collar in for the full year. And also taxes, so taxes around the world, in particular in recessionary environments, potentially being out there, we expect our tax position will be slightly higher on a year-on-year basis. So, while the operating margin or EBIT margin we expect will be up nicely, that will be partially offset by interest and taxes, delivering low-to-mid single-digit EPS growth. Operator : Our next question today will come from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead. Peter Grom : Thanks, Operator, and good morning, everyone. So I wanted to ask on the gross margin as well, which for the quarter was a bit of a surprise. So in your prepared remarks, you mentioned a number of key drivers as to why it came in below your expectations. But can you maybe unpack where the biggest variance was, whether it be sales mix, commodities versus some of these startup costs and manufacturing variances? And then just maybe following up on Chris\u2019 question, when we think about the path-forward, you mentioned several hundred million dollars of inflation for raw materials and packaging. Is there any way to kind of frame that, is that $300 million to $400 million, is it something higher? I just think it\u2019s kind of important to understand kind of the gross margin bridge as we think about next year? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. As you saw in the fourth quarter, obviously, a continued difficult environment in terms of raw material inflation, another 900 basis points on top of what we had in the third quarter in terms of a headwind on gross profit. A good percentage of that continues to be ag prices, which obviously, have continued to move south on us. And in fact, if you look at the first half versus second half, Peter, ag prices were up 25%. So, obviously, that continued to impact the Hill\u2019s business. On top of that, as we integrated the three Red Collar facilities and began transitioning some of the high capacity volume business that we had in our own plants. We obviously incurred some startup costs and some variances moving through the P&L that obviously impacted margin in the quarter as well. And then I\u2019d also characterize, as I mentioned, that obviously, the inventory reductions we saw in skin health and the drag from China on the skin health business likewise had a mix impact in the quarter. With that, let me turn it over to Stan to see if he has any more information in terms of how he wants -- we want to characterize how we are thinking about raw materials for next year. Stan Sutula : Yeah. The raw materials continue, as Noel highlighted, to be a headwind for us and your range is probably in the right ballpark here as you think about that on a year-on-year basis. But I would emphasize, it has been volatile. So things have moved up and down pretty significantly here, and in particular, the agriculture and how that applies to Hill\u2019s, those have not moderated, up in the second half, as Noel talked about at 25%, and as we look ahead, we think that will continue to be the primary headwind in raw and pack. The other volatile one is natural gas. Now fortunately, that\u2019s been a benefit here in terms of moderating in the late second half and fourth quarter. But we expect that could be volatile as well heading into particularly the back half of 2023. So a combination of those two primarily we think are the drivers as you look at raw impact going into the year. Now we have laid out our pricing actions and are funding the growth savings that we look to drive, combined with our productivity. And I will just mention Red Collar will moderate, but it\u2019s still going to be an impact on a full year basis and it\u2019s important to realize that. So that will moderate through the year on a full year basis, it will still be an impact on overall gross margin. Operator : Our next question today is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kevin Grundy : Hey. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Question for Noel and then perhaps, John, you may want to jump in on this as well. Just with respect to the impairment charge on the skin care assets and just more broadly, how this may be informing the view around capital deployment. So we can all appreciate the noncash charge. Not hugely surprising, you guys have been pretty open about some of the challenges in the business also realized higher rates when you perform the impairment test so all that kind of makes sense. But I guess just given this dynamic, it sort of back to the question, does it give you any pause in terms of how you stress the assets that you may be looking at, broadly does it increase your bias towards internal investment and returning cash to shareholders versus M&A? And then maybe perhaps just from an M&A perspective, an update on any books broadly that you may be seeing and whether private market values have started to come in a bit given higher rates and what we see in the public markets? So thanks for all that. Noel Wallace : Sure and good morning, Kevin. I think you characterized that well. So let me just recap quickly a couple aspects of skin health and I will turn it over to Stan and John for the second part of your question. The impairment was obviously based on three issues. The biggest change is our outlook on growth in China. You have seen, I think, external numbers that the Beauty segment has taken a significant hit in the last three months to six months, in fact, imports were down 20%. And given the prolonged impact of COVID in China, particularly as it impacts travel retail, which were a significant portion of our businesses, we obviously then decided to rebase the outlook in years going forward and particularly 2023 in a much more conservative position to ensure that we can deliver on the growth aspects moving forward. Secondly, the situation in China regarding tourism around the world, as you followed our business on Filorga, it really went with Chinese travel, and as Chinese travel opens up potentially in the back half, we will see an improvement. But we assumed in the impairment that, that will continue to be a headwind for us as we move through at least the first six months of the year, slightly improving as we move through the back half of the year. And then as you well can understand the significant rise in interest rates has lowered the value in our discounted cash flow. But let me step back for a moment. Again, we continue to be very confident in our strategy around skin health. Obviously, the short-term impacts that we have had related to China, we believe ultimately, we will get behind us, but we have obviously been conservative in our assumptions on Filorga. We went into 2022, assuming China would open up and it didn\u2019t. But we feel good about where we are. We have seen some early signs, certainly in the early part of the year, particularly across our European business on Filorga to give us quite a bit of encouragement. Our U.S. business continues to be very, very strong, despite the inventory pullback that we saw in the fourth quarter. If I take our online business specifically, our share growth was up 300 basis points online in the back half of last year and on the year, which is terrific. Obviously, we incurred that share growth despite, obviously, inventories getting reduced. We do expect some of those inventories to come back slightly, but we are obviously assuming a considerable amount of conservatism there because we can\u2019t be sure that particularly the online retailers will take inventory up as quickly as they took it down. Our business overall continues to grow very, very nicely, particularly in the professional channel, which is the core part of our PCA and Elta business, and we have a good innovation plan coming on stream for 2023. So, overall, we still feel very good about the strategy behind skin health. Need China to turn and you have heard a lot of discussions about the uncertainty in China, but we think we have positioned the brand. So, obviously, as China comes back, we will be in a position to reap the benefits of that. John Faucher : The only thing I\u2019d add on, Filorga, is if you go back and look at the timing of when we purchased it late 2019, it\u2019s built off of very strong growth in China at the time and very strong growth in the travel retail, and then obviously, the pandemic hit, nobody had insight to that. The underlying brand is really strong. There\u2019s going to be new innovation. We have got the advertising to support it to bring it to market. We are still confident in the long-term success of this brand. So that\u2019s what I\u2019d add on Filorga. Noel Wallace : Kevin, the only thing I would say relative to M&A strategy and capital deployment is our preference is still to deploy capital internally to our projects, because we are a big believer in return on invested capital and that generates the highest incremental returns. And so if you look at the investment we are making at Hill\u2019s and capacity, if you look at the investment we are making on some of our sustainability projects, Red Collar honestly is a little bit of both, right? It\u2019s M&A, but it also is an investment in internal growth, because we think that Hill\u2019s is one of the best growth engines we have. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any change in our capital allocation strategy, invest internally, we would like to pay a healthy dividend and the Board helps us develop the dividend strategy longer term. Then we will look at projects when the valuations are appropriate and we will see what happens with valuations in the market right now. I think the market is still somewhat influx from that standpoint. Stan Sutula : And the capital allocation, I think, as we look at that return $2.9 billion to shareholders. We had $900 million of net share buyback. We have paid dividends since 1895 and 60 consecutive years of increasing it. So our capital allocation strategy hasn\u2019t changed. We think it\u2019s the right long-term strategy and we think our investment in M&A is appropriate when we don\u2019t have a better internal investment to do or to fill opportunities for us to fill out our model. Operator : Our next question today will come from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Noel Wallace : Good morning, Olivia. Olivia Tong : My question is around Oral Care, because you have obviously made great improvements here, particularly on pricing or hearing on the portfolio. So could you give us a sense of how your game plan is pivoting as macros potentially get a bit more choppy and elasticity get a little bit more elastic. Obviously, high single-digit growth in Oral Care is fantastic, but what\u2019s your view on the state of the consumer in the U.S. and developed markets as a whole, and how that -- and how does that influence your view on potential trade-up versus trade-down in 2023? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Good morning, Olivia. Again, as I mentioned earlier, Oral Care had a really, really strong year, high single-digit growth across the year and the quarter and we were high single-digit in Oral Care on three of the last four quarters and toothbrushes specifically up double-digit three of the last four quarters. Some of that was some easier comps as we were lapping some of the supply chain challenges that we had last year. But the important aspect there is share growth up on the year for both Oral -- toothpaste and toothbrushes. Specifically around elasticity, I think, it comes back to the strategy that we talked about for a couple of years now, which is the flexibility in our portfolio. We continue to innovate across all price points and we cover a wide gamut of price points, from opening to now, obviously pushing a lot more of the super premium segment, which you saw some of the examples of the success we are having in the whitening segment in that regard. So, overall, our categories -- our portfolio is well positioned for this environment. We spend a lot of time as we work through the operations around the world to ensure that we have value-added benefits to every price point within our portfolio and we are flexing our portfolio in different ways over the last couple of years and we are seeing that certainly translate into improved performance. Elmex would be a great example. Taking Elmex very selectively in the pharmy channel -- pharmacy channel around the world has allowed us to grow incremental share in those businesses. The other aspect I\u2019d say is our core re-launches. We will have a significant core re-launch coming on the India business next year. We have re-launched our core business in some of our bigger markets around the world and that has helped some of the premium innovations come on incrementally to the franchise moving forward. So we feel pretty good about where we are with Oral Care. Elasticity is exactly where we expected and I think driven by a combination of the flexibility we have in our portfolio in addition to the innovation that we are bringing to the marketplace. Operator : Our next question will come from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Nik Modi : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Noel, I was hoping\u2026 Noel Wallace : Hi, Nik. Nik Modi : \u2026 maybe you could provide some -- a little bit more context on what you are seeing on the ground in China right now. It\u2019s interesting you mentioned you think the recovery will happen in the back half, so I think there has been projections by other companies and just by looking at some of the mobility data that things might start improving around March to April and we are already starting to see kind of we track the metro activity in China and starting to see some real improvements there. So just curious on your thoughts there given how important that business is for the -- on the margin side given the skin care mix? Noel Wallace : Sure. As I mentioned, we had strong performance in China on the Colgate side of the business. Our Holly & Hazel business up nicely mid single digits, our Colgate business up nicely mid-to-high single digits. So, overall, we feel very good about the transformation that we put in place over the last couple of years across our China business. Our brick-and-mortar business is a little soft. But as I mentioned, that\u2019s, I think, characteristic with the lack of mobility around the country and as mobility improves, as you say, and if it improves earlier, by all means, we should benefit from that as we continue to expand our distribution in that marketplace. But it continues to be highly, highly uncertain. Obviously, the Chinese New Year, everyone is waiting very carefully to see the impacts of that. There\u2019s a lot of euphoria, but infection rates are still very, very high and things could change very, very quickly there. The comment I made about the back half is not only mobility within the country, which I think will probably, as you say, improve more quickly, but it\u2019s more external mobility in terms of more international travel, which would benefit the Filorga business. But again, we feel good from the success that we are having from a market share growth. Our -- as I mentioned earlier, our e-commerce business was up almost 300 basis points on the year this year and that is again a reflection of the strategy and some of the good innovation we brought into the market. If the markets improve, we shall -- certainly see the benefits of moving through our P&L earlier than we anticipated. But I would be quite cautious on China at this point. But over the long -- medium- and long-term, we are very optimistic about the growth opportunities there. Operator : Our next question will come from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English : Hey. Good morning, folks. Noel Wallace : Hey, Jason. Jason English : So Mr. Faucher talked about the healthy growth contribution from Hill\u2019s, and obviously, the topline lift has been really last few years. It\u2019s surprising, though, to see penny profit actually contracting this year. Can you unpack the drivers and I imagine within that, you are going to come back to some of the ag inflation. So, I guess, I will tag on to that. Ag -- the ag complex seems like it\u2019s one of the easiest ones to hedge out. I imagine you are hedged out, and therefore, have good visibility to it, assuming that part of the contribution is related to ag? What\u2019s impeded your ability to price that through? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks, Jason. As you said, we have coming off of some of the challenging capacity issues that we had in the third quarter, we feel like we have certainly turned the corner on that business. Again, a double-digit growth in the quarter, that\u2019s 27% growth on a two-year stack basis and we have delivered double-digit growth on the Hill\u2019s business 10 to 12 quarters and we feel with the capacity improvements that we have and obviously the continued increased investments that we feel we are in a very good position to deliver sustained profitable growth moving forward. Now, as I mentioned, ag prices were just up 25% half-to-half. Now you take that on the year versus last year, that\u2019s significantly more. I will let Stan talk in a moment to our hedging strategy, which is very minimal around ag prices. So we don\u2019t get a lot of -- we don\u2019t do a lot of hedging there. But, overall, it\u2019s taking pricing. It\u2019s making sure that we continue to move through the transition aspects of incorp -- integrating three plants and moving capacity from our existing plants into those plants. So there\u2019s startup costs associated with that, obviously, we are building a new web plant, which should open up towards the back half of the year. We have the startup costs associated with that running through the P&L. But all of it is around building investment ability for the future for us and our ability to continue to sustain the strong topline and the strong investment structure that we have by investing in capacity and allowing us to do the things that we do so well in the marketplace. So we feel good about where the business is. Obviously, the ag prices will be where they are and we are taking pricing, as you have seen both in the fourth quarter and plan to take more pricing in the first half of this year. But, again, if ag prices come back, things will get better, but we at this point don\u2019t expect any short-term benefits for ag coming back. Stan Sutula : Yeah. Thanks, Jason and Noel. So what I\u2019d add on to that is, we don\u2019t have a large hedging program against ag and that\u2019s a philosophy for us. So we look, we do partial hedges there in ag. We don\u2019t do that in most other categories. But just while we have highlighted ag, there are other areas here like chicken livers, other specialty products that come in as part of the diets that make us more complex, as well as all the amino acids and everything else. Those have all had inflation as well. So while agriculture products have had the most significant, we have also had those and things like the AVM flu do have a ripple effect into the availability of those products. So as we look, we have also integrated now four plants through acquisitions, one from Nutriamo earlier in the year and then the three from Red Collar. So we took those over on September 30th. That integration has gone well. But as you would expect, there are startup costs that go along with that. As we bring Tonganoxie online, that\u2019s our new wet plant in Kansas in the second half of the year. We are very excited about that plan. It has great automation. It\u2019s going to be, I think, a great addition to the portfolio. But that has startup costs in 2023, in particular, in the first half as we hire staffing, get the staffing right heading into or going live. So important here on Hill\u2019s, we see a great market opportunity, science-based, our research center really supports that. We are investing the advertising behind that to drive that capability and to drive that demand and we think that serves us well for the long-term. So we expect margin improvement heading into 2023 in Hill\u2019s. We are excited about that market opportunity and what it represents to the company. We also think it fits really well in our overall portfolio with a science based approach. Noel Wallace : Jason, I\u2019d throw one other point, which I think is relevant to not only Hills, but to other aspects or other questions that have come up this morning. And that is the foreign exchange impact in Europe in the quarter, obviously, the second largest business outside the U.S. for Hill\u2019s is Europe and Europe had 11% headwind in foreign exchange and that obviously moved through the Colgate side of the business as well. Now you have seen the significant pricing that we are taking, but obviously, the transactional impact as well as the translational impact of that foreign exchange moved through in the fourth quarter, and certainly, dampened a little bit of the penny profit that we would have expected. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Hey. Thank you. So picking up a little bit on what you were just talking about in terms of startup costs, but also the manufacturing variances and the negative mix that Noel you alluded to earlier with respect to the fourth quarter. I guess, a couple of questions related to that. One is, I assume that\u2019s lumped into the raw materials, the 920-basis-point negative impact of raw materials, I don\u2019t know where else it would go. So if that\u2019s the case, I guess, is there a way to quantify what those sort of to me, non-raw materials costs would have been or were in the quarter as a headwind, number one. Number two, how we think about those carrying over and phasing at least into the -- I presume the first half of 2023. And then just to clarify and round it out is, are those are those impacts embedded in the several hundred million dollar raw and packaging materials inflation outlook for next year, just because I think it\u2019s a little bit different than raw and packaging materials as sort of narrowly defined. That\u2019s really my -- those are my main questions. If you could also talk a little bit about how you are thinking about Red Collar phasing through the year, and just operationally, what that entails, if there are costs, whether cash costs or costs that are notable going to the P&L as you do transition the private label product over to Hill\u2019s, just that would be helpful to understand? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Steve, let me take a very topline kind of strategically how we are integrating Red Collar and deliberate plans that we have take -- we have taken to ensure a successful integration into the Colgate-Palmolive Company. First, it\u2019s three significant plants that we are obviously integrating. And as we have talked about for the better part of a year, all of our existing facilities on Hill\u2019s have been running full out, and obviously, that is a very inefficient way to run your supply chain. Now we have obviously been investing in improved capacity, obviously, with the plants in addition to the Tonganoxie in addition to the plant that we purchased in Italy. But again, integrating those into the system to ensure one quality mechanisms are where they need to be, ensuring the lines are capable of the flexibility and the formulations and the sophistication of our formulations, making sure that, obviously, the all aspects of the science driven approach that we have taken to our formulas is well understood and by the culture of the organizations that we are integrating into the company. All of that has been very, very methodical. We are not going -- given that we need the capacity, we are not going to rush ourselves into doing this too quickly. So we have been very careful to ensure long-term success as we built the plans to bring that volume into the Colgate business over time. So, with that, let me turn it over to Stan. He will take you through a little bit of how we planned for Red Collar and how we are thinking about the ongoing startup costs associated with that. Stan Sutula : Yeah. So let\u2019s start with Red Collar first. So as Red Collar comes in and we cut over production over time and this will be over an elongated period of time. There are a few things that have to happen. One, and of course, I should start, all of this is baked into our guidance. So as we planned this out, this is all incorporated within our guidance. So first, as we take the Red Collar facilities and migrate those over to produce Hill\u2019s formulas, there is investment that has to go into that. We have incorporated that into our capital and we have incorporated any income statement impact into the numbers. And that really centers around what Red Collar was producing was much simpler formulas for us and for others, and our diets, our formulas are much more complex, in particular, in the prescription diet area, which is why I think they are such valuable to consumers. So that involves additional mixing, additional ability and testing, quality testing as we go in, and that will require capital investment into those facilities, all planned all on track. The variances that we have in total, so let me step back to there, the variances that we have in total go into gross profit so that as they are going through, we expect that those will get better. We expect that those will get better as we get some relief on the overall manufacturing as those Red Collar facilities come fully on board and produce more of Hill\u2019s formulas. That allows us to go in and do more efficiency planning within the existing facilities. So as we think about Tonganoxie, that\u2019s, again, the new wet food plant that will come online in the second half of 2023. In the beginning, we do have some startup costs there and those startup costs, again, are around things like bubble staffing as we bring the staff on board and get them trained and so we expect that, that will contribute in the second half, but it becomes a headwind in the first half around Hill\u2019s. So thinking about Red Collar, keep in mind that this was acquired and was in for the full quarter of Q4 of 2022. So we will wrap around from an impact here in Q4 of 2023. But as we go forward, you should think that the impact to margin is roughly in line with what we saw in fourth quarter. So it would be a benefit to the topline and given that the private label activity is at a much lower margin that will impact margin through the year but at a slightly decreasing rate. Operator : Our next question will come from Rob Ottenstein of Evercore. Please go ahead. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. A couple of follow-up questions. One, you mentioned in the press release or the comments that there was an e-commerce inventory drawdown on skin health. Can you just clarify exactly what brands that was and why that would be happening? And then I\u2019d like to just kind of talk a little bit more about Hill\u2019s. One question that we are getting is, what was the effect of private label on the organic number. So if you took private label out, was the volume growth actually down 100 basis points, so a clarification on that. And then bigger picture, if we could kind of scope out and look at the whole pet food area in general, you guys are obviously premium and have been gaining share a long time. Can you talk about historically potential trade-down impact given a tougher consumer environment and how you may be adapting to that and what your volume assumptions are for pet in 2023? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Good morning, Rob. Thank you. Let me take the e-commerce question first. A good year for e-commerce, as I mentioned, it\u2019s up to 14% of our sales. We continue to see strong growth throughout the year, and importantly, in the most important markets around the world, we continue to see strong share growth. So, overall, we feel a lot of the work that we put into our digital transformation has paid out quite nicely in the consumption that we are seeing across the board, whether that\u2019s our skin business, whether that\u2019s our U.S. Oral Care business or our Hill\u2019s business, we are performing quite well. And we are sharing those capabilities very nicely across the enterprise, and as I have talked to you before in the past, obviously, Hill\u2019s was at the forefront of that and a lot of the skill sets that we built in our Hill\u2019s organization have certainly translated now across the enterprise and we are using those benefits to grow our e-commerce business, both on a share basis and a topline basis. The inventory drawdown was on PCA and Elta in the U.S. in the online channel, which is their number one retail channel. As you know, they sell through the profession and they sell online through the big online retailers. The big online retailers took significant inventory out of the system in the fourth quarter. These are very high priced items, as you are well aware, and they felt, I guess, managing their working capital that they were going to take those down in the fourth quarter. The good news, as I mentioned earlier, we didn\u2019t see a significant impact on our consumption. Our shares were actually up and the more important news is that we started to see that inventory rebuild itself slowly, I would say, in the first quarter of this year, particularly January. Now that\u2019s not to say that at the end of the quarter, we may see more draw downs. But in any case, the good news is we start to see some improvements there. But it was on the PCA and Elta business in the U.S. And likewise, on the Filorga business in China with the significant lockdowns that we saw across China in the fourth quarter and coming out of the third quarter, we saw significant inventory reductions in the online business there as well. Relative to private label, let me characterize, I guess, first Oral Care. So Oral Care private label in the U.S. is about 0.9 share and that share is roughly flat on the quarter -- in the fourth quarter and flat on the year. Oral Care private label shares in Europe are around 3.5%, and likewise, that share is flat. We are seeing a little bit of growth in private label businesses, particularly in Europe on some of the Home Care businesses. Obviously, cleaners dish, and to a certain extent, fabric softener, as we have seen about 1 point of growth in the private label business there, but consistent with where we expected. So nothing unusual, and importantly, we don\u2019t see, obviously, given the benign levels of shares we have seen in Oral Care, we haven\u2019t seen a significant turnaround there. On the Hill\u2019s trade-down, we have not seen trade-down thus far. If you go back to 2007, 2008, which we spent a lot of time looking at the premiumization of the category during that period. We did not see consumers pulling back on scientific -- scientifically proven Pet Nutrition. And we feel that given the strength of our innovation, and obviously, the strength of the investment that we are putting in the market, that we will be able to continue to manage that quite well. Stan Sutula : So, thanks, Noel. Rob, let me just pick up on the on the Hill\u2019s organic and private label and how we are showing that. If you look at the press release, you stated, you saw net sales were up 20%, organic sales were up 14%. There is no private label in the organic sales. So we include in the net sales, but in organic, it will only be inorganic when it wraps around for the year, which will be in the fourth quarter. So when you see organic sales that represents true year-on-year with no private label benefit in that number. Similar to volume, you will see the volume in a press release at plus 10% and then organic volume at plus 0.5%. So volume expanded even outside of private label, you get a feel for the size of private label in the as reported volume number. So, again, that will be that way Q1 through Q3, and then in Q4, it will wrap around, because it will be in both years and be in the organic numbers. . Operator : Our next question will come from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yeah. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I want to go back to gross margin kind of looking backwards and then trying to think about it going forward. So I guess I am curious what happened to gross margin in 4Q, I mean, I hear all of what you talked about some things unexpected. But if you go back and look at what you said at the last call, you were locked in at least that\u2019s what I thought you said on, I assume a bunch of these raw materials, ag pieces. So was just the manufacturing variance of startup costs, et cetera, just much greater. And I guess the question going forward then is I hear you in modeling the question on this call is about, improving gross margin expectations and all these things that are potential tailwinds. But how much visibility do you have as you sit here today and what potentially is based in that could go wrong? And then kind of pushing it forward longer term, how do you think about -- how does the company think about the necessity to grow gross margins over so that you can hit the earnings algorithm for the business given where the topline expectations are and just how important that is and what line of sight you have to get back to a number, not that I am expecting you to comment on, you can get to 60% again, but if you can talk directionally to that that would be helpful as well? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Thanks, Mark. Let me start with the end, the last question first and provide some thoughts and I will have Stan walk through you a bit more of our assumptions once again. Listen, driving gross margin for our company has always been fundamental and it\u2019s always been the fulcrum of our P&L, and as we laid out in the prepared comments, we expect gross profit to be up in 2023. I remind you that the gross profit was down 160 basis points in the fourth quarter, if -- when you exclude the impact of Red Collar. Some of the issues that we incurred in the fourth quarter, obviously, we had a mix issue with the lower skin health business that we mentioned. A little bit of a mix issue on Hill\u2019s as well with more of the Science Diet business versus prescription diet, but we obviously had the elevated ag prices moving through there and the startup costs that as Stan mentioned earlier, that moved through the gross profit line. But step back, again, I mean, we are very focused on getting pricing in the P&L and you have seen that sequentially improve from third to fourth quarter. We expect that to benefit us next year. Now there are a lot of assumptions on where commodities go. We talked about a couple of hundred million dollars there. But remember where we were in the first quarter of this year. We had a lot of assumptions there and we got ahead of that very, very quickly in terms of where things move. Now if things move -- stay where they are, improve, obviously, we don\u2019t think we will be at the low end of our guidance. But we feel it\u2019s a prudent and flexible place to be given the uncertainty that we have seen and the movement that we have seen, certainly, over the last six months to nine months in commodity prices not to mention foreign exchange. So let me turn it over to Stan to give you a little bit more color once again on where we are from some of our locks in our contracts. Stan Sutula : Yeah. So on gross profit and we look at raw and pack, we do lock in a majority of our commodities here at least 90 days out for the next quarter. But there is still conversion costs, there\u2019s still the manufacturing variances that we have to go through, labor cost that goes into that, et cetera. So when we look at this and for fourth quarter, the 250 basis point as reported decline in margin, again, private label drove about 90 points of that, so you are at 160 basis points. And as we look at prices here, again, it was 920 basis points, relatively consistent with Q3 and our conversion costs and some of the variances that we talked about had an impact overall on margin versus our original expectation. As we look going ahead, we are guiding for expansion of gross profit margin heading into 2023 and we think as we look at that, the components of that are going to be moderating commodities are on pack, improved pricing in RGM and then the productivity work that we have been doing across the Board will have a benefit here to margin. So the margin expansion again fuels that investment into advertising. So we do believe that margin expansion is a core component of foundation of our overall model and so that expansion into next year will fuel that model, which will allow us to deliver low-to-mid single-digit earnings growth. Operator : Our next question today will come from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I know you have covered a lot of ground, but I just was curious, knowing that 4Q gross margins came in below what you had anticipated. You have obviously detailed the reasons a couple of times. I was just curious, the bottomline still delivered, frankly, so that means there were some choices made, perhaps, a little bit short term on lines within OpEx. So I was just curious kind of what are the areas that you may be pulled back on in the shorter term than how you kind of make those decisions and how we should think about the reinvestment in 2023? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. Well, we didn\u2019t pull back on the advertising investment, obviously, that was down 20 basis on a percent to sales, but if you exclude Red Collar advertising was flat and on a local currency basis, Lauren, the advertising was up and that becomes fundamental to continue to build the momentum of the progress we have seen in 2022 to ensure that we deliver that continued momentum in 2023 and that was a very deliberate choice to sustain the investment moving through the quarter. Obviously, a little bit of softness in gross margin, as I mentioned, largely driven by mix of the Hill\u2019s business coming in a little bit lower than we expected, as well as skin health, but we feel those are well under control. We have good visibility about where those two businesses are going. So we feel like we are in a pretty good position to continue to execute against our strategy, deliver gets the gross margin improvement in 2023. Obviously, the first half we have a bit more visibility, we don\u2019t have that visibility in the second half, but we will continue to execute against what we see in front of us and that is our need to take more pricing, get it into the P&L and ensure we have the investment to support that. Stan Sutula : The only thing I\u2019d add, Lauren, on that one is, look, we took actions early in the year, particularly around the global productivity initiative that started to pay off in the back half of the year. So we saw some of that flow through here hit in the back half of the year. And we manage the overhead lines carefully and because we are running the entire P&L up and down and those overhead lines, we prioritize within that. We want to make sure we support advertising, digital, analytics and then we make trade-offs within that, as you would expect us to do go forward. We think that\u2019s just a prudent way to run the business and we will continue to do that heading into 2023. Noel Wallace : Yeah. As I mentioned earlier, Lauren, we are very pleased with that middle part of the P&L around how we managed overheads, which given, obviously, the headwinds we have seen below that around interest expense, as well as tax, it\u2019s extremely important that we got ahead of that. We delivered an additional 50 basis points of overhead on top of the 150 basis points that we had in the previous year. So we feel that structures us well to invest in strategically the areas that we think are fundamental to driving long-term growth. Those are the capabilities that we have talked about around digital transformation, improved capabilities around innovation, certainly as we restructure that part of the organization and making sure that we have that operating leverage to sustain the advertising investment, which is clearly driving a good topline growth for us. Operator : Our next question will come from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Hey. Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone. So my question is just around cash flow. Free cash flow conversion, if I am doing the math right was about 74% of net income this year. I think in absolute dollars, free cash flow down about $900 million. So maybe you can talk a little bit about, as we look forward, do we expect some of that free cash flow productivity to improve? And then maybe just related on, I know you have talked about net interest expense being higher for this year, just if you can put a number on that and also on capital spending? Thank you. Noel Wallace : All right. Let me hit the topline, and Bryan, good morning, by the way, and I will let Stan take you through some of the puts and takes. But, overall, cash flow -- our cash was down due to lower cash income, right? Obviously, that was the higher -- that was some choices that we made, particularly around working capital investments, a little bit increase in inventories as we were dealing with some of the supply chain disruptions we saw from suppliers and our need to sustain the consumption growth that we had in the marketplace, particularly some of the stronger consumption growth, but obviously, inventory days came up as a consequence of that. But we improved a bit a bit of that in the fourth quarter versus where we were in the third quarter. But clearly, it was driven by the lower cash profits driven by, obviously, the sustained foreign exchange hit as well as the challenges that we saw moving through gross margin on the year. CapEx was the other one, a deliberate choice for us, obviously, the growth that we have made -- the growth that we put into Hill\u2019s, and the investment and the significant increase in capital expenditures there and some of the increases that John mentioned earlier around sustainability, which we think are extremely important to position us for where the markets are moving forward. And overall, I would say that we expect a very nice improvement in operating cash flow in 2023. Stan Sutula : Yeah. Let me pick up there on the cash flow. So, as Noel said, we do expect improvement in 2023 and it\u2019s really going to be two-fold. One, the improvement in cash profits, as we have guided to, and second, the improvement in working capital. We see opportunities there. We have been conservative on our working capital here in 2022 and particularly around inventory. We wanted to make sure that we could restore fill rates across the board that we had enough inventory to supply. And in particular towards the late in the fourth quarter as China had impacts from COVID on manufacturing, we prudently brought in additional inventory to make sure we could fulfill clients over the year end. On -- so on cash flow, we expect improvement in both working capital and cash profits. On interest expense, you see in fourth quarter a material increase on a year-on-year basis, and again, really comes from two components. First, the impact that it has on floating rate debt, in particular, CP, that\u2019s up significantly, as you know. And then second, we are carrying a slightly higher debt level, though, quite comfortable within our range and our leverage metrics for heading into 2023. So as you think about that interest expense, it will be larger than the gap you saw in fourth quarter, simply because you get a full year of carrying the Red Collar of funding through the year. That said, we think we have highly competitive rates on our debt going through. We have great access to the markets that fund our overall model. So, on capital spending, as you saw from our press release, we spent just under $700 million. I expect that could go up a little bit as we look at 2023 and that\u2019s really in a couple of areas. First, we are going to complete Tonganoxie as that comes online in the second half. And that we talked already about the Red Collar facilities, we have great plans for those as we are going to significantly increase our overall capacity for our Hill\u2019s business, which operates in a terrific segment and that investment obviously will have capital spending. In addition, we invest in sustainability type efforts like recyclable tube, which we think are important. We will continue to roll that out in a prudent manner and we continue to invest in IT capabilities, including our S/4HANA journey that we are well underway. So, overall, we are comfortable with the position heading into 2023 and that will expand cash flow at a material level on a year-on-year basis. Noel Wallace : Yeah. The only thing I would add is strategically these investments are all around positioning us for long-term growth and success. A lot of discussion goes into the choices we make around our capital investments. And the supply chain, and certainly, the IT team are very focused on ensuring that the money is being put into areas that are going to give us improved capabilities moving forward and allow us to weather some of the storms that you have seen over the last three years where we have recognized the challenges and generated real opportunities coming out of those and that certainly has driven the topline of the company. Noel Wallace : So, with that, let me just finish off. I think that\u2019s the end of the questions. Again, 2022 was another year of strong progress for the business in terms of sales, market shares and productivity that moved through the P&L, but more importantly, the capabilities that we are building across the organization. We are excited to see the leverage moving through the P&L and we will see that continue in 2023 that will allow us to deliver the investment to sustain good topline growth, and obviously, very focused on delivering shareholder value moving forward. We will see everyone, I hope down in CAGNY in February, where we can talk a little bit about more of our plans in terms of how we are seeing 2023 unfold. But I\u2019d be remiss not to thank all the Colgate people listening on the call for an extraordinary year in 2022, a lot of challenges, but we recognize the opportunities that we had in front of us and I wish all of you a happy and successful 2023. Thanks, everyone. Operator : The conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today\u2019s call and you may now disconnect your lines.",

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I'd like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President, M&A, John Faucher. John Faucher : Thanks, Allison. Good morning, and welcome to our 2023 first quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and related prepared materials and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Table 6 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some thoughts on our Q1 results and our 2023 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. Noel? Noel Wallace : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As you can tell from our press release and the earnings materials, we had a strong start to 2023, and the momentum on our business gives us confidence to raise our net and organic sales growth guidance and to raise the lower end of our base business earnings per share growth guidance for the year. We did this because with the quarter of the year gone, we see less risk from some of the macroeconomic and geopolitical issues that we were concerned about earlier in the year. That said, there is still notable uncertainty surrounding the balance of the year, particularly in the second half. Since the commentary focuses on the results, I want to focus my remarks on three of our priorities that Colgate people are focused on. Priority one is driving organic sales growth as we face tougher comparisons. We will utilize our enterprise-wide capabilities in innovation and revenue growth management, along with a firm commitment to marketing spending to return to a balanced algorithm of pricing and volume growth. The pricing we have taken over the past two years helps provide us with the flexibility to fund increased brand investment to support our pricing, build brand health, and drive volume and household penetration. We know that the competitive environment is going to be difficult, but we have a brand portfolio that is built for times like these, and we look forward to driving growth and market share performance moving now. Priority two is delivering our productivity to fund the brand investment while we're also delivering on our earnings targets. We had a strong start to the year for both Funding the Growth and our 2022 global productivity initiative and we are laser-focused on delivering against or exceeding our goals for the year. We still foresee year-over-year headwinds to earnings per share growth from raw and packaging materials, foreign exchange and below-the-line items, so driving productivity in the middle of our P&L is vital. And finally, we are focused on improving our cash flow performance. Again, we had a strong start to the year with both operating cash flow and free cash flow up and we know there is still opportunity for further improvement. We will utilize this cash flow to fund the growth in capital expenditures to return cash to shareholders through dividends and to drive earnings leverage through paying down debt and repurchasing shares. So I'm pleased with how we started the year, but I'm also well aware of the challenges and uncertainty ahead for us. Colgate-Palmolive, however, has the brands, the capabilities and the people to deliver in this environment. So with that, I'll take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys, good morning. So clearly, strong top line results in Q1, but we're also obviously in a period of outsized pricing. And the question is sort of where do we land as the pricing trails off? So just A, just can you discuss your confidence that volume will recover going forward as pricing drops off? I know it's a bit of an unanswerable question at this point, but how do you think about that dynamic ahead of time and manage your business to drive sustained volume growth as you look out longer term? And B, maybe as a bit of a window into that performance when category pricing drops off, can you just talk about your market share performance in Q1 in some of your key regions and product categories and if the strategies are working in terms of driving improved market share trends? Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Dara. Let me come back again to the strategy that we've been deploying over obviously the last couple of years and continues to execute against the initiatives that we've talked about, particularly at CAGNY, and that's driving the core and adjacencies and channels. And you see the progress we're making against all three of those, obviously delivering sequential volume growth in the quarter. So we had five of the six divisions sequentially up in the first quarter. North America was down. But if you pull the Fabuloso recall out of the North America business, North America would have been up sequentially as well. And all of this plays back to our belief that the strategy clearly is working to deliver improved volume despite the fact that we continue to take significant pricing across all of our geographies and our categories. So quite frankly, we're very pleased with the progress we're seeing, and we expect sequential volume improvement as we move through the year to go fear. Now that is contemplated on a consumer environment that remains where it is. We shall see where the consumer goes relative to the level of inflation being absorbed in the marketplace, but we feel strongly that we've got the right portfolio of brands across price points, the right innovation, the right channel strategies, particularly where consumers are shopping today to continue to drive growth. Importantly, as we saw in the quarter, our Oral Care business was up double digit, and that's both positive pricing and positive volume in toothpaste, and we saw good share growth in the first quarter on toothpaste in North America. Good -- very strong share growth across Europe. Flat shares in Europe -- excuse me, in Latin America, and good share growth in Asia. So overall, we feel good about where we are from a consumption standpoint and the strategies that we're executing and expect sequential volume improvement as we move through the back half of the year. And as you said, pricing will get more challenging as we lap the back half. And certainly, in the second quarter, which was a strong quarter for us, where we had strong pricing and volume in that quarter, we'll expect a little bit of pullback from there. But overall, we feel good about the momentum we're behind the business right now. Operator : Our next question today will come from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Filippo Falorni : Can you talk about the consumer health in your key emerging markets? What are you seeing in terms of response to recent price increases? And then as you mentioned, like the second half, obviously, a lot of uncertainty. Maybe can you compare and contrast how do you see the consumer environment evolving in emerging markets compared to your more developed markets like the U.S. and Europe? Noel Wallace : Yes. Emerging was strong. You saw obviously double-digit organic in the quarter. Sequentially, again, volumes performing better than they did in the first quarter. And if you look at the pricing that we've taken in emerging markets, over the last three quarters, quite frankly, we're pretty pleased with the fact that the volume sequentially continues to improve. Now that being said, we've got strong innovation in emerging markets and you've seen the level of advertising that we're putting back into the business. That gives us, again, confidence that we're able to sustain that advertising as we move into the back half of the year, and we intend to continue to do everything we can to increase that advertising support in the back half, particularly in emerging markets in order to : one, support the innovation we have; second, drive the pricing into the market and continue to accelerate volume growth in the category. So overall, emerging pretty good. We were really pleased with the progress in both Latin America, Africa and Asia, particularly in China, strong growth in all three of those regions, particularly in the key markets of Mexico, Brazil and China and South Africa. So good progress across emerging markets and shares holding up, a little more elasticity as you would expect given the level of pricing that we've taken in emerging markets. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we stand in that regard. As it relates to the second half, time will tell. As I mentioned upfront, we'll see the compounding impact of pricing across many categories as we move into the back half. And I expect a better balance between pricing and volume as we move through the back half, but we shall see. The good news is we've got strong innovation. We've got the pricing in the P&L, which is really important in order to get the flexibility that we need to drive the business in the back half of the year. And we feel we've got a good channel strategy to ensure, as I mentioned upfront, that we're capturing the omnichannel impact of how consumers are shopping today. Operator : Next question will come from Peter Grom of UBS. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. So I appreciate all the commentary on inflation in the prepared remarks. But maybe as a point of reference, Stan, is the $300 million to $400 million headwind that we discussed on the last call, is that still a reasonable range? And I guess what I'm trying to get at is the dollar impact from the 770 basis point headwind in the bridge, this morning you\u2019re you pretty close to that range from a dollar perspective. So -- and I realize there's more than just inflation in that line. But is there just any way to frame either what inflation was within that number? Or how to think about that component of the bridge more broadly as we move through the balance of the year? Stan Sutula : Yes. Thanks, Peter. So first, as we look at that inflation level, that $300 million to $400 million range is still the range that we're seeing on commodities. But there's really a tail underneath this. And in particular, around ag that affects predominantly Hill's, those prices still remain elevated. We don't see a lot of relief coming on those, and we see that kind of continuing as we go through the year. That's the main driver of our range, which is why we haven't seen it come down more. If you look at the other categories, like we do for toothpaste, Home Care, Oral Care and Personal Care, those have moderated more, and that was reflected in our guidance for the year, and they stayed reasonably balanced. So as we look out -- remember, we're essentially locked in here for Q2. We have locking already in place for Q3 and a little bit less for Q4, I still that as the viable range going into the back end of the year.  Now what happens is on a year-on-year impact, we wrap around on the very significant increases last year. The pricing that we've taken helps to moderate this. And then as you saw, we had an exceptionally good start to Funding the Growth this year, and that has also helped to mitigate that. That gives us the confidence to say that we will increase margins as we go through the year despite the fact that we expect that the commodities are still going to be in this range due to inflation. Operator : The next question will come from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And congrats on a strong result here. Noel, question for you on reinvestment. So obviously, strong results here. You guys are getting the top line payback that you'd hoped for. You're seeing gross profit come through. You've made it a point since you come in -- since you came in, just increased advertising levels and seen that. The advertising and marketing as a percent of sales was high even by historical standards. That's a good thing, of course. How are you thinking about reinvestment levels should you exceed on gross profit? Number one. And then number two, realizing that it's top line payback and profit growth that's sort of driving the decisions and not necessarily as a percent of sales, but are you comfortable with where you are? I mean, it's high, 12% of sales is high relative to historical standards, which dipped to 9% at -- if we go back here to '15, '16 how are you thinking about that? How should we think about that as gross margin begins to improve? Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Yes, we're really pleased with the level of advertising we're getting in the P&L, and that is obviously driven by the circular nature of how we're driving the business, obviously, more advertising is driving the top line, and we're able to get more leverage to the P&L to continue to support that. And we feel as we move out getting the pricing in the P&L was critically important to sustaining and increasing our levels of advertising. We've obviously moved more money into digital. We're seeing great ROIs on digital and our programmatic and the personalized content that we're delivering in the market. We're seeing growth in market shares relative to where we're spending the money, particularly around the Hill's business, and our Oral Care and Skin Health businesses. So we're really pleased with the fact that the advertising levels continue to deliver against the expectations that we have. And we balance that off with obviously a broad portfolio of offerings that we think are attracting and building the brands that we speak. We have high household penetration, with many of the brands around the world, our ability to drive reach and continue to sustain that reach is very, very important to the growth that we're seeing in the business. As we look forward, we would anticipate to continue to spend behind those businesses. We still have some businesses, in my view, need more support, particularly businesses in parts of Europe and some of the categories in the U.S., and we would expect to continue to fund those as we get more gross margin accretion through the back half of the year because we're seeing the results. And ultimately, the brand equity, which is obviously the big testament to the brand support and how are we getting what we want out of it continues to show a strengthening of our brands, and that bodes well for continuity and sustainability of the growth moving forward, and that's how we're kind of running that flywheel right now, continue to invest, drive leverage in the middle of the P&L, accelerate the top line and ultimately deliver better margins, better earnings per share for our shareholders. Operator : Our next question will come from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Olivia Tong : I wanted to talk a little bit about gross margin. Clearly, Funding the Growth start of the year materially better than expected. I imagine it's a function of supply chains improving a bit, if you could expand on that a bit. And then usually, your savings contribution build as the year progresses. So should we assume sort of a regular quarterly cadence from here? Or is there something onetime-ish that happened this quarter to result in the strong Funding the Growth contribution? Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Olivia. This was very intentional. As we went through the back half of last year, we were deliberately looking to make sure that we have projects in place for the first half of this year in order to accelerate gross margin accretion given the inflationary pressures that we were seeing. In addition, I would say that we've done a lot of work on getting our facilities to run far more efficiently, whether that's the Hill's facilities where capacity utilization has come down, which has allowed us to put more funding to growth projects onto the line to determine their feasibility. We've had the teams, obviously, very much focused on the opportunities that we see in the first half in order to ensure that we get that gross margin back in quickly to once again sustain the advertising and the increases we want to see in the back half of the year. So it was deliberate and strategic to make sure that we got more of that funding to growth up front. And the teams have really done a wonderful job in that regard as you saw in the numbers and we would certainly expect that focus to continue as we move through the balance of the year. Let me throw it over to Stan. He'll give you a little bit more color on what we're seeing again around commodities and some of the other projects that we have underway, particularly around our global productivity initiative. Stan Sutula : Yes. Thanks, Noel. And just a quick comment on the FTG. Noel highlighted that we had a very strong start here. That SKU, I think, is going to be a little bit different than prior years. In prior years, you saw build through the year. This was very deliberate. Supply chain has moderated in terms of the volatility around that. In particular, the Hill's team has actually had time to work on some of these as we've had a little bit better improvement in capacity utilization. So the strong start we have to the year, I think you should think that this will be more equal as you go through the year versus growing through the year, so from a SKU point of view. And this is important because as we look at the material cost, there's still going to be a headwind as we go through the year. So we need that to help offset that impact. And then we have our GPI program, we continue to get benefit from that. You saw a small charge in the quarter, but the team is driving productivity throughout the P&L, not just in the GP line, but also in the MBO line as we look for things to offset that material headwind. Operator : Our next question today will come from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Carey : Good morning. So Stan, I just wanted to confirm one comment about commodities. I think it was somewhat clear. But to Peter's question, just around the $300 million to $400 million range, is that what you're expecting for the full year from an inflation standpoint? And then just a little bit related on the North American operating margin that has been stepping up kind of sequentially and then slowed a little bit this quarter, obviously. I would have thought maybe with the transportation and logistics relief and building productivity and a little bit of easing inflation, maybe that can keep going, but I know there was obviously some noise with the North America business this quarter with recall and otherwise. So is there any way you can maybe just unpack that North America margin performance and where you see things going? So thanks for that clarification on commodities and the comment on North America. Stan Sutula : So why don't I start here? North -- first, let's start with the commodities. So as we said, still $300 million to $400 million range on that impact. I don't see that moving a lot in the short term. And keep in mind, our locking, right? So we're already into almost May, so 2Q is largely locked. And as we go into the back half of the year, hopefully, we'll see a little bit of relief come through. But keep in mind, the closer we get, the more we lock in order to ensure we have supply. If we think about the North America margin and go through, so North America margins here still improved on a year-on-year basis. They also improved on a sequential basis. So as you look at the progress on what we're doing from a GP point of view, that's important. We do see some logistics benefits here. Logistics have come down versus the start of the year. But again, we start to lock in some of that activity. We've seen it mostly in the ocean side of logistics, which will certainly help the overall margin. And if you think about North America in total, clearly, Fabuloso recall had a impact in the quarter. That's getting largely behind us, so we expect that we'll see improvement as we go through the year. Noel Wallace : Yes. Maybe a couple of things. So as Stan said, obviously, operating profit was up nicely, which has been the big focus for our North America business. We were up roughly 300 basis points on operating profit in the first quarter. So we feel we're making the right step, taking the right decisions and making the right progress against the middle of the P&L, particularly around gross profit and controlling our overheads and managing logistics. So that was an important element, and we're making sure that, that progress has been reinvested in the business. So a couple of other highlights on North America. Obviously, ex-Fabuloso, volume would have been up on the quarter, great quarter for toothpaste. Toothpaste was up double digit in the quarter for North America with growth, including volume growth on that business. Toothbrush is a little softer. You remember, we were lapping a resupply of our product last year and some out of stock from some of our competitors. So volumes were a bit down there. Personal Care, up high single digits. Home Care was soft, as we mentioned, due to the Fabuloso recall. But overall, really good progress. The other aspect to North America that I would call out is the significant progress we're making in non-measured channels. And again, this is part of our strategy of growing in faster-growth channels, where we saw significant growth in non-Nielsen channels, which was terrific for North America and has obviously helped to drive some of that top line growth. So overall, a good quarter for North America, very focused on the middle of the P&L moving forward, and we see opportunities, but the good news is we're seeing good progress on the top line, and that's translating to the P&L. John Faucher : Just one point of clarification on that. North America volume would have been up sequentially from Q4 to Q1 performance from Q4 to Q1, not up year-over-year ex Fabuloso. And then, Stan, on the... Stan Sutula : Yes, on the operating margin, it's up year-to-year versus fourth quarter, you see it's down about 100 basis points or so. And that's really driven by the Fabuloso impact, combined with the increased investment in advertising as we're bringing both innovation to market and supporting the pricing that we've taken in the market. Operator : Our next question today will come from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : If I could just ask a quick clarification on the raw material, the ag stuff. Stan, can you just give us any more detail on exactly what ags are causing the pressure and what's driving that? And then my broader question is Noel on the whitening innovation and just the whitening strategy. I'm just curious if you've done any halo work on the impact it has on the core Oral Care franchising or toothpaste. Any perspective around that would be helpful. Noel Wallace : Sure. Let me -- Nik, let me take that, and then we'll have Stan get to some more specifics around the Hill's commodities and particularly the ag prices. Yes, the strategy that we have on whitening is very much about building the brand, particularly here if you take North America, the Optic White brand. And as we expanded into at-home whitening at very significant premium prices and the significant efficacy that those products deliver in the market and to the consumer, we've seen very nice halo impacts across the entire Optic White range as well as the Colgate brand. So the short answer to your question is, clearly, the halo effect is transferring to the entire Optic franchise as well as improving the Colgate brand. Stan Sutula : Yes. And Nik, on the commodities, it's kind of across the board with most of the ag. So corn, wheat, soybean, the risk of the drought in the U.S. and the effect on crops, even though some other areas of the world are a little bit better, the risk of Ukraine, all has been pushing pressure on that. Don't forget as well that the protein side of this, things like chicken livers, et cetera, with some of the impacts that have been out there has all put pressure on Hill's. That remains the real driver of that $300 million to $400 million range. Operator : The next question will come from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey. Good morning, folks, and that's a great segue because I wanted to talk about Hill's actually on it. Good quarter, obviously, enough for Hill's with the profitability and the margins. We've lost over 1,000 basis points in margin in the last few years. I was hoping you could unpack the components of it, and the cadence at which you can recover, if you were to recover them. So how much are we looking at from the mix effects of recent acquisitions? And what's the cadence of bringing your capacity on there and improving that? How much is related to like the slack capacity, the underutilization of the assets that you're standing up and maybe some of the stress in the supply chain as a result of past utilization?  And then I think the third bucket and tell me if there's other buckets, I think the third bucket is the pricing at the cost. How large is that bucket of the roughly 1,000, and is it reasonable to think that could come back? And if so, when? Sorry for the multipart. Noel Wallace : No. Thank you, Jason. So let me top line Hill's a bit, and then Stan can provide a little more of the specificity that you were looking for. But structurally and strategically, this business continues to perform very well, continued sequential improvement in volume and strong organic growth despite the difficult comps that we continue to come up again. So overall, pleased with the 14%. And again, that's 14% on 13% last year and pricing of 11.4% on 9% last year and obviously sequentially improvements in volumes. So a couple of things there. Stan will get into, obviously, the key drivers of the operating margin dilution, which would be the following. Obviously, ag cost, the manufacturing integration of the three Red Collar facilities plus the Italian facility that we have as we move through the variances associated with that. Red Collar in the current quarter is a significant portion of that, the private label business. We've continued to obviously significantly increased our advertising support. We said we would do that as we built up more capacity. That is very strategic and deliberate and we're seeing the results of that in the marketplace, particularly as we drive new innovation into the market, and we drive pricing in the market, the ability to sustain and elevate that moving forward is going to be largely driven by our ability to sustain the strong levels or even increase our advertising levels. As we look forward, strategically, margins will improve sequentially as we move through the back half of the year. Plant efficiencies will continue to deliver progress in that regard. We'll get the constraints out of our existing plants, which we're running at full throttle that will allow us to be far more efficient in those plants, put more Funding the Growth into those plants as we look forward. So overall, strategically, the business is doing very, very well, and we feel all the steps we've taken to improve capacity ultimately delivering good, strong line growth. We need to focus on the middle of the P&L, as you rightfully say, and the progress is there to do that. Stan Sutula : Yes. Let me pick up here. So first, if you take a look, these investments in the business and if you look at the net sales, keep in mind, you go back just a couple of years ago, we're up well over $200 million quarter versus first quarter of 2021. So the investment in the brand is paying off. If we look at margin, the private label has -- what we said as a 90 basis point impact to the total company has slightly over 400 basis points impact to Hill's. So as you take a look at that margin impact, that is a material impact to Hill's on a GP basis. Now through time, that private label will wind down, and that will be over the next couple of years as we slowly wind down that contract and then backfill it with Hill's volume at Hill's margin. Now as we've already talked about, all of the raw material impact inflation has predominantly been against Hill's also impacting their margins. But keep in mind, they've taken significant pricing here over the last several quarters, and that is helping to mitigate this. And the fact that we're now, as the Red Collar facilities have come on, that's helping us manage utilization, not just a Red Collar but of the entire manufacturing footprint. That's enabled Hill's to contribute materially to the funding of the growth savings. So I think where Hill's is right now is well positioned. I think we'll see sequential improvement in margin as we go through the year. We're going to manage that carefully so we can continue to supply our clients and we saw material improvement in case fill rates coming out of first quarter. Operator : Our next question will come from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : I just -- I've got a quick clarification first for Stan. I think in the guidance, we talk about net interest expense maybe going higher than your original plan. So could you put some -- maybe if you can just put some color, put a number on that. And I'm assuming -- is this related to the refinancing? I think you refinanced some debt in March. So is it just related to the refinancing of the debt? Or is it exposure to like short-term financing variable rates? And then I have a follow-up. Stan Sutula : Sure, Bryan. Thanks for the question. So first, on interest here as we look, this is -- well, we want to call it out because we saw rates going up, this is not a large number. So you should think around $20 million for the year. It's not really related to the first quarter debt issuance. We are very happy with that. We had very good demand on that bond. It's really the assumptions on the number of rate increases and predominantly in Europe. So as we look at the ECB and the changes there, the slight difference to what we had anticipated coming into the year. As we all know, that's a moving target, and it's going to depend on inflation moves to central banks, but that's our best guess right now. So that's a modest impact for the year. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Great. And then a question for Noel. Just you talked about, I guess, risks in the second half. And maybe if we just kind of think about that at a higher level, it sounded to me from listening to the Q&A and reading the prepared remarks that a lot of that risk is what the consumer may or not do, less so than concerns about volatility in input costs or supply chains? And risk has got a lot of definitions, right? So if you could just maybe talk a little bit about like what the specific risks are and maybe how Colgate is in a position to manage that risk maybe a little bit more -- with a little bit more agility than maybe was the case two years ago? Noel Wallace : Bryan, thank you. So clearly, the consumer environment is the one that's the big unknown, I think, to everyone. And that's been a consistent theme through the first quarter print by most in terms of what's really going to happen in the back half and the compounding impact of pricing. I'll address the fact that historically, when we've seen significant inflation in our categories, we weathered those periods really, really well, a combination of great value-oriented innovation and the fact that our -- the breadth of our portfolio at various price points affords us the opportunity to really push different segments at the appropriate time anywhere around the world. So we're pleased with that. We're also pleased with the fact that you tend to see in times like this, a squeeze in the middle of the category with premium growing and the value growing, and that's been our focus, quite frankly. Premium has been the key focus for us, and we're seeing great progress, particularly across our Toothpaste business in new channels and at the premium end of the market, and we obviously have a very strong base business that is well positioned based on some of the relaunches we have. Raw and packing materials, we shall see, we've seen a stabilization across at least the Colgate side, you've heard a lot about the ag prices that continue to elevate, but we've seen a stabilization on those as we move. So we've got more predictability on that. Hence, the reason why we felt more confident the raise in guidance across multiple dimensions there because we see a little bit more transparency to that. As Stan mentioned, we've got some contracts that will obviously come off. Now the unknown there is what our suppliers would do. They're facing rising wage inflation, and we'll have to deal with that as it comes, particularly in the second half of the year relative to how they decide to adjust pricing on some of the key commodities that we will ultimately be purchasing. The other aspect is China. We will see where China impacts not only the Asia business, but the world, quite frankly. We expect obviously a slow progress in that market. I don't expect it to be vertical. I expect it to be a progress from quarter-to-quarter. We have not seen the travel retail business come back yet, and that is an expectation that we will probably see in the second half of 2023, not in the first half, but we shall see. Now we'll get into Asia and China, I'm sure as the Q&A progresses, but we had obviously a very strong quarter there, and we think we're well positioned as that economy comes back to deliver on it. The last is foreign exchange. That clearly is always a risk. We -- as you saw in the prepared remarks with low single-digit foreign exchange impact through the P&L, we'll see where that moves. The Latin American currencies have come back a little bit here as has the euro, but it's been very volatile, and we'll adjust to that going forward. But that has been a big driver in the past as you know, but we think we're well positioned right now from the fact again, of getting strong pricing into the P&L, both in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Operator : Our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Two questions sort of like everybody else. But the first was is just pretty basic. And I was curious if you could offer any perspective on volume performance by category that you've seen? I know that's not typically something you discuss. But as we kind of think about that path forward and that shift in the -- towards a more balanced revenue algorithm, I was just curious where you stand on kind of volume growth by segment. And then the other question was, Noel, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned something about knowing the competitive environment would be difficult. And I just -- we haven't heard that from a lot of other companies, and I didn't know if it was sort of a particularly pointed comments or just a general commentary on your ability to compete and confidence in the innovation pipeline and advertising support. So just curious on a little bit more color behind that -- I mean, sorry, on the competitive environment. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, and good morning, Lauren. Let me take the second question first. The competitive environment will likely intensify particularly as you see costs come down, and that will be a function of both local brands and private label getting more aggressive. The good news is our categories. If you take North America and private label, we're benign, no progress in private label shares. So to speak, with the exception of a little bit in liquid hand soap and a little bit cleaner, a little bit more acute of private label growth in Europe. As you saw price discrepancies or the gap between private label and global brands increase, we'll see how that translates in the back half as we expect them to have to take pricing in the first quarter as we did as well. So we think local brands in private label likely to elevate in terms of their competitive nature in the back half. And as costs to stay flat in the back half, which is what I think we're hearing from most, we expect the competitive environment to increase in that regard. Obviously, you'll see more promotional volumes probably come into the category, but it's been quite constructive so far. I will say that, but we need to anticipate that things could worsen based on where the costs are, and we're well prepared for that. On your first question, volumes. So category volumes, if I take just the market volumes in general, flat to slightly negative across most of the world on the volume side, obviously, driven by the fact that there's so much pricing that's gone into both Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care. If you look at us specifically, really strong growth on the Oral Care side, as I talked about, double-digit growth across most markets in Toothpaste, good volume progress in most markets on Toothpaste. So we're really pleased with what we're seeing there. Personal Care up mid- to high single digits depending on the marketplace. Both from a pricing standpoint, a little bit more challenged on the volume side given the strong pricing we've taken there, particularly in categories like liquid hand soap and bar soap. And on Home Care, mid-single digits to low single digits in terms of growth, depending on the marketplace. And that one has experienced a little more elasticity, particularly around the cleaner side of the business where we've seen more price competitiveness in that side of the business and a little bit more trade down. But overall, again, sequentially up and really pleased with sequentially up, given the fact that we had a lot more pricing in this quarter than we had in the fourth quarter. So good progress overall. We'll have to watch the volumes carefully, and we're all over that. Operator : Our next question will come from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Mark Astrachan : I wanted to ask about EBIT margin in North America and Europe. If you take a look at where you are today versus where you were a few years ago, it seems like it's outside of Hill's, one of the biggest drop-offs relative to historical levels. I appreciate inflation, FX, et cetera, but it also seems like maybe those markets are a little bit more competitive than some of the others. Is it levels of spend that is potentially impacted that? And kind of how do you think about progression of margins? Is it realistic to think that you could eventually know sort of timeline around that to get back to those levels? Why or why not would be helpful. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Mark. Yes, your answer is clearly around the spending. That's the answer. The spending is up quite notably in North America, that's very strategic. We see that as a growth market for us moving forward, not only on the top line but on the bottom line. We really wanted to reinvest behind the business in some of our brands, and we're clearly demonstrating that as we've gone through the last couple of quarters. Getting gross profit in the middle of the P&L sorted out in North America. It's clearly been a key focus, and we've had good gross profit progress in North America. We're getting better overhead leverage through the P&L. We're getting a lot better efficiency in our plants, and so we'll see that translating moving forward. But we will continue to invest behind that business moving forward to drive the top line. Europe, a little bit driven, obviously, by the foreign exchange environment to a certain extent and obviously, more increased inflation in Europe than we've seen in other markets around the world, particularly around the high gas prices and the fall-off effects of higher gas prices, and some of the raw materials that we purchased into our European plants. So overall, there's been a little bit more pressure there. But again, we've taken strong pricing in the back half of 2022, and pleased that we were able to execute our pricing in the first quarter of 2023 towards the latter end of the quarter, and we'll see that benefit us as we move forward. So overall, your observation is correct. We feel -- we've got a good handle of getting the gross margins and the operating profits up sequentially as we move through the back half of the year and importantly, sustaining or increasing our advertising levels to continue to drive the top line. Operator : Our next question will come from Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : Just a couple of cleanups, I guess. Just the first one on -- just on the Fabuloso recall just because I've received some confusion in my inbox during the call. Just is there a way to quantify what the impact was in the quarter? And does that reverse out as a benefit in the second quarter? That's question number one. Question number two, on the logistics topic. I don't know if there's a way to quantify what the benefit was or how you're thinking about the expected benefit over the course of the year, but that would be helpful as well.  And then the last piece is I guess it kind of builds on Jason's question on Hill's margins, but I was -- specifically on the Tonganoxie plant, just where that is and what the time line is to get that up to scale? And just is that a material driver of the margin bridge as well? Or is it more on the margin? Noel Wallace : Great. Thanks, Stephen. Let me take the Fabuloso and the Hill's question, and I'll have Stan come back to you on logistics. So the Fabuloso impact was Q1. It was a material impact to the North America volume line. We're not going to quantify that, but it was quite significant to the volume performance in North America. That is behind us as we move through into the second quarter. So we'll see the benefits of the Fabuloso business coming back into the P&L as we move forward. Again, if you take the Fabuloso business out of the North America number, they were up sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2022 in volume. So it was a very time-driven event in the first quarter. And the good news is that's behind us. Tonganoxie progressing, as you know, strategically, that's a very important plant for us given the strong demand we have on the wet side of the business at Hill's and our inability to supply the current demand for wet products all around the world. So getting that plant up and running will be strategic for the continued growth of that business. That will happen towards the tail end of the third quarter. And we anticipate, obviously, we'll have some start-up costs associated with that as we move through the transition of that facility. But overall, we should see that benefit us moving into 2024, particularly at the margin line as our wet business is margin accretive to us and will certainly benefit the Hill's business longer term. Stan Sutula : Yes. So let me pick up on logistics here. So you saw logistics was 9.5% of sales. And if we look -- it's been incremental headwind to our overheads. Remember, it's in our overheads and SG&A for several years. And in Q4, we saw the first year-on-year decline as a percent of sales in 12 quarters, and it was down again this quarter, and we expect it to be down for the year. I expect as we kind of look out through the remainder of the year, it's going to come down slightly. I don't see it coming down materially. So we're at 9.5% now. I still think it will probably start with the 9% as we go through the remainder of the year. So certainly a help year-on-year, but as we kind of look out through the rest of the year, I think that's how you should think about as a percent of sales, it will moderate and stay just above 9%. Operator : Our next question will come from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Two follow-ups. First one, a quick one. You mentioned that the -- you were very strong in non-measured channels in North America. Was that more e-commerce or club stores? And can you give us some metrics around that? That would be helpful. And then my core question is really on the advertising spend pickup, 14%, it's a big number. You mentioned for the full year that you would be up absolutely and as a percent of sales, so can you give us a little bit more sense of where that money is going? Is it more innovation and longer-term focused or maybe more short term? And then following into that, do you expect to see this elevated level going forward, either because you have very high return projects or you need to catch up, just trying to get a sense of what the income statement may look like longer term? Noel Wallace : Sure, yes. Good morning, Rob. Let me take both those questions. First, on the non-measured channels. Again, this plays back to the strategy that we've been talking about for quite a few years now. And certainly, I highlighted again at CAGNY that we are very focused on growing channels that particularly are not measured by Nielsen, which are the faster growth channels, as you mentioned, e-commerce, club stores, discount stores, value discount stores. Some of the big box stores that we're seeing emerge in Latin America. So overall, in some of the new obviously platforms that we're seeing coming out of China, so this has been strategic and deliberate for us. And if you take the North America number, we've seen significant growth in non-measured channels to the tune of 4x to 5x what we're getting in measured channels. So obviously, good growth there. The key is to sustain that growth. Our e-commerce business was up double digit in the quarter, now roughly 14% of our total sales. So overall, and we're seeing good share growth in those businesses. In fact, if you take some of the progress we're seeing in China, very much driven by the strong e-commerce shares that we had. I demonstrated that at CAGNY. And in fact, since CAGNY, we've continued to increase our e-commerce shares in China, and likewise, in the brick-and-mortar business. So overall, we feel the strategy is working for us. Again, largely driven by the fact that we're supporting our businesses. We're using a wide spread of different mediums to grow brand awareness and brand penetration. Obviously, TV for a lot of reach and frequency given the scale and scope of our brands in many markets, but really fine-tuning behind our digital transformation, our ability to drive higher ROI spending in the digital space. And clearly, as we see more ROI coming, we see continued growth in terms of penetration, in terms of consumption, and in terms of ultimately delivering share growth and category growth for our retailers, we'll continue to elevate our spending. We're measuring it very quickly. This is not just for the sake of increasing spending. We want to be sure and absolutely deliberate and making sure that the spending is returning back to the brands, driving category growth. So there's not a specific number we're aimed at, Rob. We're looking to obviously continue to accelerate and sustain the top line and grow the health of our brands and we're seeing good results from the strategy we've put in the marketplace. Operator : Our next question today will come from Fulvio Cazzol of Berenberg. Fulvio Cazzol : Mine is on the medium-term outlook for the Pet Nutrition category. How should we think about the medium-term growth prospects as the tailwinds ease from increased pet ownership during COVID, et cetera. And I was also interested in your view on the competitive standpoint, like if you're making some investments on capacity. And I think some of your peers are making significant investments. I think Nestle is doing quite a bit on manufacturing. Is there a risk that the supply-demand balance turns less favorable in the coming years and result in softening industry pricing power? So that's my question. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thank you very much. Let me take -- let me answer a couple of ways on the first part. First, obviously, coming through COVID, pet adoptions increased quite significantly. Those pets will continue to obviously age, and we will have, obviously, therapeutic and wellness products delivered for an aging pet population. So we feel good about that. You will recall, we've talked about the low brand penetration and brand awareness of the Hill's franchise. So we feel even if the market softens a bit, which we have not necessarily seen a little softness in volume, but not necessarily in value, as you see premiumization continuing to grow the market today. We feel we have the right portfolio of brands to continue to grow in the right investment strategy, hence, the aggressiveness of the advertising to ensure we're building brand awareness and penetration off the lower levels that we have today. And we also feel we've got opportunities internationally that we have yet to exploit given some of the capacity constraints that we have. And so we'll continue to obviously go after those moving forward. We feel -- I can't address the capacity issues or where the capacity is in the market. We're obviously putting capacity for our business. And we see that, obviously, as a real plus for us as we move forward, not only to drive better efficiencies in the plants that we currently produce in. But as we bring Tonganoxie up to line as we bring the Italian facility up to speed relative to our recipes, we feel we have real growth opportunities to continue to expand those segments where we weren't competing nearly as aggressively in the past. And so overall, that will not only drive our business but will drive the category as well, given the levels of support that we'll continue to bring to our retailers. Operator : Our last question today will come from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Noel, Stan, I appreciate the sequential improvement in volumes that you called out worldwide. Are you still seeing a premiumization playing out, starting to see consumer down trade into the entry level price points in some parts of the world. I know mix is part of your volume numbers. So I was wondering if you can speak apples-to-apples into the volume increase that you're seeing sequentially. And then a clarification on the Latin America and in European, including EMEA. I understood the share stabilized, especially in LatAm. But assuming it was mostly value share, given that, obviously, you're the leader and you're leading in pricing. So how about the volume share in those regions? And how are you seeing that play out as you progress, especially as you over SKU in Personal Care, in particular hand soap and the other categories within that sub-category? Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks for the question. Clearly, as we've seen in prior challenging the markets with a lot of inflation, you kind of have the tale of two cities, which is the premium segment continues to grow and that's the area where we're under-indexed in. So clearly, that's fueling a lot of our advertising investment and our channel strategies, particularly in Oral Care and in the Skin Health business. So we see that segment continuing to grow. The middle getting squeezed a bit and the lower end with the point you made, a little bit more trade down into the lower end. Now remember that some of our lower end businesses, while the absolute margin dollars might be lower, the margin percent might be as good or better than some of our premium segments. So overall, we feel pretty good about the mix of our business, and that continues to be, in our view, a real advantage for our portfolio relative to the breadth of our portfolio. Relative to volume shares, particularly in the emerging markets, we have taken significant pricing in emerging markets. And we clearly done that to ensure we get the flexibility in the P&L as quickly as we possibly can, that we sustain the advertising numbers or increase them to drive the innovation and deliver the pricing, particularly for the premium side of the market. We've seen a little trade down, particularly more in the Home Care businesses. The cleaners segment, I would point out in the dish segment, a little bit of trade down, particularly in Latin America. Personal Care, holding up okay. Bar soap tends to be more price elastic than many of our categories. But we've seen a lot of constructive pricing from our competition. So there hasn't been a significant amount of trade down to private label as of yet, but we'll watch that very carefully. So Home Care a little bit more challenged, particularly around the Cleaner segment worldwide and Personal Care in the Bar Soap segment. Oral Care looks okay, as I mentioned, were up by double digit in Toothpaste with both positive pricing and positive volume. Operator : This concludes the Q&A portion of our call. I will now return the call to Noel Wallace, Colgate's Chairman, President and CEO, for any closing remarks. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, everyone, for your interest in our company. And let me just extend a personal thanks to the 34,000 Colgate people who have worked tirelessly to deliver a stronger momentum in the first quarter, getting us off to a strong start for the year. We greatly appreciate their steadfast resolve and the innovation that they're bringing to the market and the strong execution. So I look forward to talking to everyone in the second quarter. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. Welcome to today's Colgate-Palmolive 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I'd like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Executive Vice President, M&A, John Faucher. John Faucher : Thank you, Allison. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the Q2 2023 earnings press release and related prepared materials and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the Q2 2023 earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some thoughts on our Q2 results and our 2023 outlook, and we will then open it up for Q&A. Noel? Noel Wallace : Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. So a few quick thoughts this morning on our strong quarter of top and bottom line growth and clearly along with the improved 2023 outlook we provided. On the first quarter call, you'll recall, I highlighted three priorities for the year, driving organic sales growth as we face tougher comparisons, executing on productivity and revenue growth management to fund brand investment, while also delivering on our earnings targets, and improving our cash flow performance. While not without its challenges, in Q2, we made strong progress on all three of these. On organic sales growth, Q2 showed the strength of our global portfolio as we delivered our strongest quarterly growth on a two-year stack basis since Q3 2008, with both organic volume and pricing growth accelerating on a two-year stack basis. We delivered organic sales growth in all six divisions and in each of our categories grew in the mid-single digits or higher. We are laser-focused on returning to balanced organic sales growth and we believe the investments we are making, combined with easier comparisons, give us a path to improved volume growth going forward as we leverage increased brand support and innovation while still delivering profit growth. The strength of our revenue growth management efforts, combined with our progress on funding the growth, drove improvement in our gross margin both sequentially and year-over-year. Our Base Business SG&A was down 30 basis points in the quarter. A strong sales growth, lower logistics costs and the benefits of our 2022 global productivity initiative drove operating leverage even as we increased advertising spending by 20%. Combined with our gross margin expansion, we delivered 60 basis points of operating margin expansion in the quarter. This enabled us to deliver upside versus expectations in the quarter despite continued pressure from below the line items, including the impact of higher interest rates and tax. As you've heard me say, it's just virtuous combination of growth driven leverage, revenue growth management, cost containment and productivity to drive investments in capabilities and brand building which drove the strong quality of this quarter's results. We believe it also lays the groundwork for our performance across the balance of the year and into the future. And finally, our strong cash flow performance continued in the quarter, which is helping us offset some of these below the line headwinds. Free cash flow was up more than 50% in the quarter and is more than up -- up more than 80% year-to-date through net income growth and improved working capital performance and pleasingly, particularly in inventories and payables. So I'm pleased with how we started the year, but I'm also well aware of the challenges and uncertainty ahead of us. Our goal is to deliver consistent, high quality compounded top and bottom line growth to drive shareholder value. And I believe Colgate-Palmolive has the brands, the global footprint and the people to deliver. So with that, I'll turn it over to the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And Our first question today will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey. Good morning, guys. Noel Wallace : Hi, Dara (ph). Dara Mohsenian : So another impressive quarter of organic sales growth. And as you mentioned, the CAGR is accelerated on a multiyear basis, but it was driven by pricing more than entirely. And obviously, from here, we're going into a period where we're cycling higher pricing. So can you just talk about, conceptually at a high level, how you think about the balance of organic sales growth going forward, level of visibilities that volume can come back as pricing drops off? And maybe within that question also, if you could just touch on the global Oral Care share and the performance in the quarter and prospects going forward, that would be helpful also. Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Dara. So let me go back to a couple of the comments I made in my opening statement and really talk about how we're trying to work to improve the quality of the P&L, which puts us in the best position to drive compounded long-term balanced growth top and bottom line, which is what we've been talking about for quite some time. As you know, we're coming out of what has been the worst raw material environment in decades. So our plan is with the combination of the revenue wealth management we talked about and the discipline that we're putting across the company in that area, more pricing and productivity, we can restore our gross margins and that's been the key focus. We believe that if we exit this type of environment with a structurally lower gross margin, you're going to be in a hole that's very difficult to dig yourself out of in the future, particularly because you need the gross margin to fund the investment in capabilities and the brand building, which you certainly saw in the quarter. We want to grow margins while still investing behind our brands and sustain a consistent organic sales growth, which we're clearly demonstrating. The key to do is getting pricing in the P&L. We certainly focused our teams on the ground in that area because the depth and duration of this cost inflation that we're experiencing has been an issue and you simply can't do it with one round of pricing. It needs to be consistent and deliberate and purposeful. And now as we look at cost inflation slowing overall, there are still places where we see margin pressure. So we -- of course, we need to take additional pricing, and this has had an impact on the volume. Maybe a couple of examples. China is a good example. We've taken pricing on our Hawley & Hazel joint venture in order to improve profitability long-term to drive the necessary investments in digital, the premium innovation required in that market and a continued shift to e-commerce. And as you know, China is a very difficult market in which to take pricing. And in the short term, that hasn't -- that's had an impact on our volume through lower promotions and wholesaler inventories as we look to set the new pricing in the market. But the long-term implications of not restoring margins are more problematic. I'd go on to North America as well, where we're working to improve the health of our business and our brands through shifting more consistent brand support from above the net revenue line to obviously into margin expansion. This will improve health of our brands and our P&L. We're seeing this play out in our non-promoted share, which is growing, which is a healthy way to grow the business. In the short term, was the volume impact from reduced promotions more than we expected? Yes, it was. But the good news is, we've adjusted the P&L, we've strengthened it and we can adjust moving forward as we see the opportunities provide themselves. So while we're delivering both sales and profit growth along with increases in brand support in the middle of the P&L, it's clearly a healthier way to drive the business. If I look at the Hill's business, we're still seeing high levels of cost inflation, as you've heard us talk about in the first quarter and gross margins are still down year-over-year. So we've taken additional pricing to get the right margin structure for this business for the long-term. Much of the Hill's volume decline in the quarter was in emerging markets as much of the time is due to go-to-market changes or shipments that we had. The good news is the EMEA or our Europe business, and particularly there we were strong, U.S. volumes were only down slightly in the quarter against a very difficult comparison with pricing as you saw up in the teens. But we're focused on getting Hill's back to volume growth the right way. This is a business that responds very well to science driven innovation and strong advertising. We want to make sure that it's well funded and through the gross margin expansion that you've seen. And Hill's saw the biggest advertising increases in brand building in this quarter and will continue to fuel that investment. So I understand the importance of gaining volume growth, as you asked. We know we're all focused on that and as you are. But as I said, we want to do that in a way that sets us up structurally for long-term profitable growth. That means a good visibility towards restoring our gross margin to previous levels through revenue growth management and productivity that we've been talking about, well-funded advertising and the ability to drive operating leverage with the strong innovation that we're bringing to the market and healthier brands. So with a lot of great work by Colgate people, we have gross margin, overheads and logistics trending positively. We just finished the first half where we increased advertising by 17%. We have put additional pricing in place. We have strong innovation across all the divisions and categories. And we have second half volume comps that are easier by about 500 basis points. So we feel we're very well positioned. So with that, let me turn it over to the other questions. Operator : Our next question will come from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead. Filippo Falorni : Hey. Good morning. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up on the prior question, Noel. You mentioned the need to take incremental pricing. Can you give us a little bit more color which category, country combination are you taking more pricing? What has been the response so far, and generally, like the magnitude relative to the prior price increases? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Let me just come back to a quick finish on Dara's point. He asked about market shares. Dara, so our market share -- global market shares are up on toothpaste around the world. Strong growth obviously in Europe, a little softness in North America, as you've seen in the scanner data. And we're obviously addressing that as we go into the back half. Latin America shares look good. Asia shares look good. Africa shares look really, really strong. We're up or flat in all the 11 markets where we read shares there. So overall, oral toothpaste shares are pretty good. Filippo, on your question with regarding the pricing, certainly in some of the higher inflationary markets, we will probably still see pricing in the back half of the year. Take Turkey, take Argentina, take Pakistan and some of the other higher inflationary areas around the world. We took pricing in the second quarter in North America. Obviously, that had some impact on volume in the quarter. But we'll see deliberate and very focused pricing where we have margin pressure. On the Hill's business, clearly, we've seen ag prices accelerate through 2022 and into '23. So we're taking pricing commensurate with that as we move into the back half. But it will be more isolated and targeted the bigger price increases are in the P&L. And as you heard us talk about, we took a lot of pricing in 2022. About 58% of the pricing in the P&L this year is flow through from last year. So we still have a little bit to go, but most of it is in the P&L already. Operator : Our next question will come from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Hey. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Noel. Maybe just kind of tying it back to -- maybe this ties back to Dara's question. But in the prepared remarks, you talked about -- on a percentage of sales basis, SG&A would be up in North America, Europe and Hill's to support volume acceleration. And I guess, as we look through the results, it looks like it's been pretty good in Europe, like, you've gained share. So maybe if you can, for some context, in terms of that investment, how much of it is \u2013 like, where has each of those geographies progressed relative to the investment? Is it right to read that you're having an impact in Europe and you still have some catch-up to do in North America? Just want to get some color on that. Noel Wallace : Absolutely. Thanks, Bryan. Yeah. I'll start with Europe. Obviously, we've increased investment there and we're seeing terrific response to particularly the elmex and meridol brands where we've elevated our investment there, but likewise, on the Colgate brand. So a lot of the efforts that we've had on premium whitening have played out to drive incremental share in Europe. So that investment across that business is certainly playing out. But importantly, the investment in Europe is broader based than just Oral Care. We have a wonderful relaunch on Sanex, that's underway across Europe. We're putting investment behind that. We relaunched our Soupline business in France, which is a big business for us. And we've launched the Suavitel -- the Soupline Hearts, which we're putting investment behind that. So I think what's important is with operating margins back to growth, it's giving us a lot more flexibility to support a wide array of brands, particularly in Europe. And that would be the case likewise in Latin America, where we've obviously seen a little pickup in exchange. So on a local currency basis, we're getting more advertising. And I'd also point to the fact that we're getting more efficient and targeted with our advertising with some of our digital skills that we're implementing across the world. North America, it's taking a little bit more time. You certainly have seen the promoted share fall off. But as I mentioned in my comments to Dara, the important thing is our non-promoted volume share is growing. And that's a clear reflection of the fact that we've increased support on the brand and building the health of the brand. And if you look at the attributes of the Colgate brand, particularly in North America, we're seeing good movements in terms of how we measure the health of the equity. So good news there. Asia, likewise, good response. We've obviously seen a fall-off on our biggest business, which is Darlie due to the price increase. But the Colgate business overall, where we've added more support similarly is responding very, very well. And we couldn't be more happy with the progress we're seeing in Africa on the Oral Care business with the elevated increase that we're seeing. Advertising doesn't respond immediately. It takes quarters after quarters of consistent growth. And what\u2019s important, back to the quality of the P&L, is that with the quality of the P&L where it is, it allows us to sustain that advertising. In this quarter, you obviously saw us increase it. And that\u2019s clearly the strategy because over the long term, consistent levels of advertising play out for brands the best. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. Noel, you mentioned the balanced volume and pricing, obviously, impressive to see some of the green shoots in Africa and Eurasia. Can you talk also about the brand support above the line you mentioned in North America and elaborate more on that? And obviously, that has been a main drag to global volumes. And I understand it takes time, of course, to see volume share rebound. But do you see in terms of like when should we see some improvement there as you talk to your customers? And then sorry to get a second part of the question, but I want to understand also your impressive rebound in margins in the quarter came through. Even looking at your prepared remarks, you mentioned raw material and packaging, you still ahead of 540 basis points negative impact. So I'm thinking about the cadence of this inflation, if you can comment and then how we can expect that from here? I know you reiterated margins up, but I just want to see to the P&L, what would be the puts and takes there? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Andrea and good morning. So on above the line expenses, obviously, when you're in an environment of inflation and recovering cost and taking pricing either through list prices or revenue growth management, it involves a reallocation of your promotional dollars for two reasons. One, you want to ensure that when you're taking list price increases, you see that pricing in the market and you get consistency of implementation around the retail environment. So that was an important part of the second quarter pricing we took in North America. To do that, you need to pull back on some of your promotional volumes. That was done, one, because some of those promotional volumes are unprofitable. So as I mentioned earlier, we are very focused in North America on building brand health and getting back to consistent delivery of share growth with advertising and innovation through simply -- and simply taking some of the reliance on promotions away. Did we pull back a little bit too much perhaps? But we're going to be very thoughtful moving forward on how we put grocery net back into the North America business to ensure that we continue to grow margins and obviously grow share at the same time. But we will ensure that, that happens in the back half. But I can tell you that we're going to be very thoughtful on how we approach all the categories relative to promotions to ensure we maintain the margins in the P&L. And around the world, I think we were quite consistent with the above the line where we had list price increases. We were managing promotions. We'll have a little bit easier comps as we've talked about on pricing -- harder comps on pricing in the back half, but easier on volume. So I think we'll see a better balance between our organic growth as we move through the back half of the year, but we'll still see a little bit of pricing moving through, as I mentioned, upfront. On the margin line, clearly, very pleased with the progress that we're making both at the gross profit level and the operating margin level. And I remind everyone that our gross profit does not include logistics and cost of goods. So if you take logistics, obviously, we had a very strong quarter relative to gross profit acceleration. And our SG&A was down despite the fact that we took a 20% -- we implemented a 20% increase in advertising. Let me turn it over to Stan. He can give you a little bit of color on how we're thinking about raw materials phasing out through the balance of the second half. Stan Sutula : Thanks, Noel. So raw materials, as we look towards the second half, we will see these moderate. But there are pockets that actually are going up, and predominantly, they're impacting Hill's. So around ag and proteins, those continue to escalate. So while on a year-on-year basis, these will moderate slightly coming off of the first half, they still will be a headwind in the second half of the year. Now we continue to drive funding the growth savings. The teams have done a really nice job on driving that productivity and we will carry that through the back half of the year as well. So we do expect margin to improve in the second half and continue that momentum. And then obviously, just as we look at FX, it's going to bounce around here a bit. And in particular, we've seen pressure in Africa, Eurasia countries as well as Asia-Pacific. So overall, we do expect margins to improve in the back half of the year. Operator : Our next question is from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Great. Thank you. First, can you just elaborate a little bit on what the impact of logistics is just so we can kind of compare you to your peers? And then specifically on the U.S., could you just talk about the path forward? I mean, we talked about the -- what's driven some of the challenges so far in terms of volume. But could you talk about the actions that you're planning to take for the second half, whether it's some relaxation in terms of the pullback and reinstating perhaps some of the promotion or other actions that you're planning to take with respect to the U.S. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Olivia and good morning. I'd ask you to reference the Q on details on logistics. There's a lot more detail in there. And if you're not finding what you need, obviously follow up with John and Stan afterwards. On the volume cadence, certainly, as you look at the back half, as I mentioned, the comps get much easier. But despite that, we're going to be very deliberate in how we think about volume creation in the back half. We\u2019re going to be thoughtful, as I mentioned, continuing to focus on the structure of the P&L, which we believe is absolutely imperative for the long-term sustainability of the company. We think that we can keep the gross margin accelerating, we\u2019ll keep the advertising in the P&L and not simply chasing unprofitable volume. So we\u2019re going to be very focused on that. That being said, we do expect a slightly heightened promotional environment in the back half. As cost tend to level out, we\u2019ll see probably a little bit more promotions. I will say that around the world today, we have not seen an elevated promotional environment. We are recently starting to see more volume being sold on promotions but not the frequency of promotions there or the depth of promotions in the market. So that\u2019s an important aspect. But we\u2019re going to be very deliberate in how we think about the promotional cadence in the back half, probably a little bit more in the U.S. But the rest of the world will be very targeted where we see competitive needs to put more money there. But so far, it\u2019s been quite constructive. And we continue to believe pushing our brands through innovation and top \u2013 and advertising is the healthiest way to grow the business longer term. Operator : Our next question will come from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English : Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for swapping me in. Stan mentioned earlier the elevated degree of inflation that's continuing to impact, but also the new price increases. How should we expect them to translate into margins? I mean, it's good to see the moderation in gross margin expansion this quarter. But we're still down a lot from where we were. What is the right level of profitability for that business on a normalized basis and what is the pathway to getting there? Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks, Jason. So again, we are taking aggressive pricing across the Hill's business, as you've seen through the recent quarters and we continue to see some inflationary prices on ag prices. Now do we think that's going to continue into '24? Unlikely, but we want to assure we continue to take pricing this year to recover that. Is there a number that we're targeting? No. We want to continue to do this in a very thoughtful way. We see real opportunities to continue to grow both gross profit and operating margin at Hill's in a healthy way quarter-to-quarter moving out, particularly given the pricing that we'll see flow through the back half of the P&L and hopefully a more benign cost environment. We also have mixed opportunities that we're very focused on as we get the new Tonganoxie up and running and the wet -- and we get wet capacity building that will allow a little bit of margin accretion on mix. So we're pleased with that. We're getting the productivity through the plants operating more efficiently. So we'll see that. And obviously, as the private label business comes off, that will be a natural organic accretion to both gross profit and operating profit at the end. So good aspects to \u2013 as we see the business projecting over time. We\u2019re going to ensure that we\u2019re competitive relative to pricing in the market. We\u2019re going to continue to ensure that we keep the high levels of advertising there on the Hill\u2019s business, which you saw in the quarter. So overall, we feel pretty good about the phasing of gross profit accretion moving forward. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Stephen Powers : Hey. Thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask more of a general question on the state of the advertising industry as you see it. You talked obviously making increases, the 20% increase this quarter. I guess the question I'm left with is just how you're seeing the efficacy of that advertising. Do you believe the efficacy is up commensurate with the increased dollar investment or is there inflation or other dynamics cutting into that efficacy just as you the environment today as you plan ahead? Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks, Steve and good morning. I'll take you back to CAGNY, when Eve (ph) presented a lot of our digital advancement and the digital transformation and ultimately how our focus on digital advertising is yielding a much higher ROI, we have the ability to analytically measure that much more effectively than we have in the past. Our copy effectiveness is getting much better. So we're seeing the efficacy delivered there through the brand health measures that I talked about earlier. We're obviously spending more money on generating first-party data. That allows us to obviously look more holistically across the market and get more targeted media that's more personalized and effective, which has been terrific. And as I mentioned upfront, the non-promoted volume share in the U.S. is a big metric for us because that clearly indicates that our advertising is driving more non-promoted share. So we were up about 100 basis points in non-promoted share and that's excellent. That's exactly what we want. Now we may have pulled back, as I mentioned, a little too much on the promotion, but we'll get the balance right as we move forward. So the efficacy overall, we're very pleased. And that's clearly demonstrated in some of the market share performances as we have around the world, where we've had elevated advertising to support that, particularly across some of the brands -- non-Colgate brands. I mentioned Sanex in Europe. We talked about the Suavitel business and the Axion business in Mexico, which is obviously well supported. So overall, we see a more healthy balance of advertising across our categories. And over time, this is going to lead to more sustainable growth. Operator : Our next question will come from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Robert Ottenstein : Great. A quick follow-up and then my other question. Where your volumes are down, particularly in the U.S.? Has that gone to competitors or is it more of a function of consumers postponing purchase or orders being postponed? So that's just kind of the follow-up. And then my main question is, where you see yourself in digital and e-commerce. Arguably, a few years ago, you were unsatisfied and have made a lot of investments and they're certainly panning out particularly in China. Do you believe that you're kind of where you need to be, to be fully competitive globally in digital and e-commerce now? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks, Rob and good morning. So on the volume, particularly in the U.S., as I mentioned already, we saw some -- our promoted share fall-off across a couple of our categories in the U.S., as we pulled back on some of the promotions and established some of the new pricing. Where it's gone to is a multitude of the competitors, obviously, where they have not pulled back on their promotional levels as much. And therefore, we saw a little bit of migration to them. But clearly, that consumer typically responds to promotions, whether it's couponing or otherwise. And they're not that difficult to get back, but we want to get -- we want to get those consumers back in a much healthier way moving forward. So the overall structure of the U.S. P&L improves and that's pretty consistent around the world. When you pull back on promotions, you're going to have a highly driven consumer that looks at pricing and value, and you need to ensure that you're obviously providing that value moving forward. So we'll get the balance right. Our digital -- on that, we've talked a lot about our digital transformation, yeah, three years ago, we weren't where we needed to be. And I would say we're very, very pleased with where we are today. We do an external study with BCG, which assesses all of our peer group vis-a-vis their digital capabilities. And three years ago, we were below the peer group. Today, we are above the peer group. And we're not best-in-class yet, so we feel we've got more room to go. And Brigitte and Diana and Prabha and all the operating units are very focused on this, and we feel we\u2019ve got good plans in place to continue to advance that. And our goal is absolutely to become best-in-class. Operator : Next question is from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to maybe talk a little bit about Latin America. I know it's a market where you've been putting a lot of premium innovation in place. It's been a core part of the strategy, particularly in Oral Care. And yet there's significant inflation in some markets. So I was just curious for an update there may be on premiumization versus affordability, what you're seeing in terms of consumer trends outside of the reported results, but kind of what the dynamics are from a consumer environment standpoint and how you're managing those two ends of the pricing ladder. Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks, Lauren and good morning. So you saw the results, another really strong organic sales growth for Latin America. And pleasingly, after five quarters of double-digit pricing, we saw volume improve in Latin America. And I think this is a good proxy for as we think about pricing in other markets and coupling that with strong advertising, ultimately the volume will come back. It's a quite resilient consumer. They're accustomed to inflationary pricing. But as long as you\u2019re bringing a collection of strong innovation and continuing their brand support, which is vitally important to come out of these tougher times with stronger brands, you see the volume return to category. So both Mexico and Brazil delivered volume growth in the quarter and both had very strong growth organically given the fact that they also took pricing. So overall, really pleased with what we\u2019re seeing in Latin America. And likewise, we\u2019re seeing the velocity and the turns improve more than we anticipated given some of the inflationary pressures in those markets. Now we shall watch it very carefully as the inflation continues to mount. But overall, structurally the P&Ls are in good shape, and the consumer seems to be quite responsive to the innovation and the pricing that we\u2019re putting in the market. So overall, we feel we\u2019re in a very good place. Operator : Question is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yeah. Thanks and good morning. Wanted to ask a question on the Hill's business. Again, just maybe thinking about category than your business. So how are you thinking -- or what are you observing from the category standpoint? We can obviously see somewhat U.S. data, but curious how you think about it around the world that volumes overall are a little bit weaker. How much of that is a reflection of just all the pricing that you and your competitors are taking? Is there some of just sort of pause within the category over the -- after the last couple of years of really strong growth and adoption levels? And then longer term, how do you think about -- and maybe this goes to Jason's question a little bit, but how do you think about the contribution to price and mix and volumes for that business over time? And how does that contribute to improving margins relative to where we are? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks, Mark. So clearly, another strong quarter for Hill's, double-digit organic sales growth despite lapping. And I remind everyone that we're lapping 18% growth in the year ago period. So obviously, a really strong quarter. And the quarter a year ago was mid-single digit volume, so ultimately, a good quarter. And on a two-year stack, we were up. So looking quite strong. Categories softened a little bit towards the end of the category -- I mean, excuse me, the end of the quarter. You would expect that given the amount of pricing that\u2019s gone into that over the last three or four quarters. But overall, Europe continues to be very strong. U.S., strong despite very high comps. We anticipate that we\u2019ll see a little bit of sluggishness as we move forward in the categories, only because of all the pricing that\u2019s been taken. But that will be more around the discretionary items in pet specialty than food. Nutrition seems to be okay. I walked stores with some of the CEOs of the big pet specialty retailers recently, and they seem quite bullish relative to the nutritional and particularly the premium segment of the market, where you don\u2019t see a live elasticity in terms of when consumers trade off of diets, particularly on our prescription side. But we\u2019re going to have to watch that quite carefully because there\u2019s been a lot of pricing that\u2019s going into the category. Emerging markets continues to be a real growth opportunity for us. It\u2019s small for us right now, but we need to continue to focus on those opportunities, particularly in Latin America and in Southeast Asia, to a certain extent. So overall, you\u2019ll see us focus on those moving forward. But the categories continue to be quite robust, particularly given the growth headwind \u2013 growth head space that we have in emerging markets given we don\u2019t have high penetration there. So overall, we feel pretty good, but we\u2019re cautious on ultimately how the category continues to evolve from a volume standpoint as we see a lot of pricing going in those categories. But again, getting the P&L structured right, getting gross margin up consistently over the next couple of quarters will be very important for us to maintain the high advertising levels that are so critical to drive penetration in that category. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Chris Carey : Hi. Good morning, everyone. So just a couple quick follow-ups for me. Just -- and apologies for asking a North America question. This is more about making sure expectations are set and we know how to think about this going forward. But a little bit of promotions come back in, but you're really focusing on a more sustainable total P&L. Could still see some volume pressure for a bit until you lap some of these strategy adjustments that you made. And by the time we get beyond that, perhaps the volumes start to smooth out a bit more. So am I characterizing that correctly? And then second, just a quick clarification or follow-up. Olivia asked a question about freight. I think the 10-Q just says the year-over-year change. Dan, you had said 9.5% of sales was the freight number in Q1 and you expected it to trend low 9s for the rest of the year. Did that come through in the quarter? So thanks so much on those two items. Noel Wallace : Let me -- Stan answer the logistics question, then I'll get back to your North American question. Stan Sutula : Yeah. So logistics is playing out like we expected and improved slightly from the previous quarter. And we expect that, that improvement will also continue in the second half. Noel Wallace : Chris, on North America, so I think you said it well. I mean, we're looking very deliberately to improve the structure of that P&L as we move forward. Again, it's -- the inherent objective there is to improve brand health. So we will clearly continue to fund advertising. We will be very choiceful on where we start to look at elevating promotions to recover some of that promotional share. Our focus is driving non-promoted share moving forward. But we need to be careful that we're not pulling back too much there. So we'll monitor that moving forward. And we'll see, I think from quarter-to-quarter, there will be a little bit of volatility in the gross margin line as we move forward as we see costs ultimately level out and where the pricing and the mix ends up. But we feel good about the back half relative to our ability to continue to drive operating margin expansion. I remind everyone that North America -- the North America HPC business is about 20% of our total business. And what is so nice about the Colgate business is that we have such diversity of our business around the world that as we need to fund opportunities in North America or Asia, we will have the ability to pull from certain regions around the world. So we\u2019re well balanced in that regard. And I think North America has a good plan for the back half and we\u2019ll be very deliberate on their spending and their focus on recovering some of the share loss that we\u2019ve had in the quarter. Operator : Our last question will come from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator and good morning, everyone. So I wanted to just circle back to the top line growth, which the second half organic sales guidance is still relatively wide and implies a decent slowdown, which makes sense as you start to cycle pricing. Can you maybe just talk about the moving pieces that would put organic revenue growth at the higher end or the lower end of that range as we move forward here? And maybe specifically, you mentioned several times throughout this call the sequential improvement on a two-year stack for volume. And just given the step up in investment innovation, should we expect that trend to continue as we move into the back half of the year? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yeah. So it's tough to nail down exactly how the balance will end up. I mean, we'll have to watch it very carefully. It's going to differ by category and by geography. But clearly, the comps get easier from a volume standpoint in the back half. You heard me mention around 500 basis points. So that will certainly be a nice tailwind for us. And obviously, the comps on pricing get a little bit more challenging in the back half as we move forward. But we feel very good relative to the guidance that we provided and comfortable that we can achieve that. But we'll see how the categories behave, if the consumer continues to be rather fickle around the world. But as I mentioned, it's been very constructive promotionally. And so far, the resilience, particularly in markets like Latin America, and to a certain extent, Africa, had been very, very good where we've taken a lot of pricing. We'll watch North America quite closely. And obviously, we think we continue to have a lot of hedge based on the Hill's business as we continue to drive penetration and share growth, which, incidentally, I didn't talk shares on Hill's. They continue to respond very, very well with share growth in the quarter across most of our recipes, which is terrific. So we feel good about where we are in the guidance and we'll see where it ultimately ends up. Obviously, if there's upside, we'll take it. But we feel good that we're in a range that is responsible to continuing to keep the structure of the P&L the way it is. Relative to -- the second part of your question was on -- was on advertising, Peter or what was it on? Peter Grom : No. It was just the sequential improvement on a two-year stack basis. Just recognizing that the comps get easier, if the two-year stack improves, what does that actually imply? Because it would seem to imply it does improve that there could be some nice improvement in return to volume growth in the back half of the year? Noel Wallace : Yeah, exactly. And you said it well. I think we'll start to see a return to volume growth in the back half of the year. The two-year stacks, as I mentioned upfront have continued to accelerate. We'll have to -- my expectation, you'd probably see that moderate a bit as we move through the back half, but volumes will improve. And as I mentioned, we still have some pricing coming through that we've taken this year, so we'll see the benefit of that and a little bit of the flow-through from last year. So overall, I think we\u2019ll have a more balanced composition as we move through the back half of the year. Operator : That concludes the Q&A portion of the call. Noel Wallace : Great. Well, thank you, everyone, and thanks for the questions this morning. We continue to appreciate your interest in our company. Clearly, we had a strong quarter and I hope you agree, the strategies and the plans in place to deliver consistent compounded profitable growth are there and that will allow us to drive increased shareholder value. We couldn't do this without the incredible efforts from Colgate people all over the world who continue to focus on execution of our strategy and the consistency of delivery. So I thank them and I look forward to talking to everyone in the third quarter. Operator : The conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. Welcome to today's Colgate-Palmolive Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Executive Vice President, M&A, John Faucher. John Faucher : Thanks, Allison. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the Q3 2023 earnings press release and related prepared materials, and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the Q3 2023 earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some thoughts on our Q3 results and our 2023 outlook, and we will then open it up for Q&A. Noel? Noel Wallace : Good morning, everyone. I want to give you my thoughts this morning on a very strong quarter of top and bottom-line growth, along with our raised 2023 outlook. As you can see in the materials we published this morning, our strategy is working, and the continued execution of the strategy leaves us well positioned as we look out to the future. We believe this will enable us to deliver balanced organic sales growth going forward, growing in all six divisions, all four of our categories, and with both volume and pricing growth. Organic volume performance improved in the quarter, which we believe puts us on our way towards a return to volume growth. And with the leverage from this balanced growth, along with the global productivity initiative, focused cost containment, and our funding the growth initiatives, we now have multiple points of leverage in our P&L. This should enable us to deliver consistent operating profit and earnings growth going forward. You can see this in our Q3 results as our gross margin was up both sequentially and year-on-year, driven by sales growth, and overheads were down, driven by logistics. This leverage allowed us to deliver another quarter of double-digit operating profit growth, along with a 23% increase in advertising. Some of our markets remain choppy and the headwinds like foreign exchange and higher interest rates will continue to impact us, but we are leveraging the strength and the global reach of our brands while driving scale advantages through our science-based innovation, digital marketing, revenue growth management, and best-in-class on-the-ground execution. Our momentum leaves us very well positioned to deliver strong results with compounding top and bottom-line growth as we look to generate consistent long-term value creation for all of our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to the questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope you're doing well. So, Noel, I wanted to ask specifically on just kind of the return to balance topline growth and kind of how you see that evolving over the next couple of quarters. I mean, excluding H&H, you probably already would've been there this quarter, as you highlighted in the prepared remarks. So, is this something that you kind of expect to achieve call it in the near term as you kind of exit 2023? Or is it going to be a dynamic that you would expect to kind of play out over the next several quarters? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes, good morning, Peter. Thanks. Listen, we're obviously very pleased with the sequential improvement really throughout the entire P&L. Volume improved, and as you rightly pointed out, if you take the Hawley & Hazel business out, which as you know, we're working through a price increase in that market, our volume inflected positive in the quarter. And we've seen that pretty consistent around particularly some of our emerging markets where we saw very positive volume. So, we\u2019re pleased with the sequential improvements. The category dynamics are consistent with what we talked about, but they're not necessarily linear. I mean, we're seeing some puts and takes as we look around the regions and the different categories that we compete in. Obviously, taking more pricing across the pet food business as agg prices continue to stay high, but overall, the sequential improvement is playing out more or less as we anticipated. And as we move forward, our intention is to continue to drive balanced organic growth in the short and the long term. Operator : The next question is from Andrea Teixeira of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. Noel, you mentioned the full-year guidance, of course, was raised seven to eight, but it still implies a deceleration, of course, in the fourth quarter. And you called out in your prepared remarks, some of the puts and takes, in particular anniversarying the acquisitioning path, and then that would lead to a reduction in third-party manufacturing for private label. Can you break that down because it also implies, I'm assuming the base business a deceleration, and I understand that you're lapping a lot of the pricing, but just as we think about volumes and in particularly North America, there has been a sequential improvement and you called out as well that you are expecting promo and more activations in trade. So, anything you can share with us in terms of the progress you've made to regain volumes in North America as it relates to the full guidance for the fourth quarter. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Good morning, Andrea. Let me take the North America piece of that question first, and then I'll highlight more strategically across the enterprise. So, North America is on pace with exactly what we talked about in the Q2 call, continued sequential improvement across the board, and we anticipate that they will see sequential improvement in their business as we move through the fourth quarter. A lot of that was getting the promotional cadence right, and we started to implement some of that promotional opportunity in the backend of the third quarter. Most of that will come through in the fourth quarter, and we're pleased with it. Obviously, the important part about North America is the oral care business, that inflected positive with high single-digit growth in oral care and positive volume growth on that business in the quarter as well, and we anticipate that will continue as we move through the balance of the year.  So, North America overall trending as we expected. We're still not pleased with some of the scanner shares, but as we said, we'll get the promotional opportunity right as we move through the balance of the year. And importantly, our non-promoted volume, which reflects, I think, the strong advertising that we're putting into the North America business, continues to inflect positive. Strategically, around the world, we\u2019re seeing volume improve across the world. Now, that is based on a lot of the geographies we've seen the pricing start to subside a bit as we're not taking more pricing in some of the markets. Really pleased seeing in markets where we took pricing early, like Latin America, where we've seen a very positive inflection in volume. Volume was up 5%. And if you look at Mexico and Brazil, specifically, Mexico was up mid-single digits. Brazil was up high single digits in volume. So, again, I think a reflection of the strong advertising innovation and the fact that over time, as pricing settles out in the market, you see the volumes come back and that's pretty consistent. Europe, likewise, a little improvement in volume. So, we're seeing exactly as we expected to see volumes start to sequentially improve, but it's not necessarily linear. And I want to leave that point that we'll watch that carefully as we move forward and we'll continue to implement our strategies of strong innovation across the core adjacencies and channels, and we'll see that play out as we move forward. Operator : Our next question will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. DaraMohsenian: Good morning. Can you guys discuss market share performance in your key geographies and product categories in Q3, how you're performing on the share front? And given you've taken robust pricing, what are you seeing competitively in terms of the pricing and promotional environment and how might that play into your shares performance? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure, thanks. Good morning, Dara. Sure. Overall, shares look good. We're up on a global basis. Let me just take toothpaste, which we track globally. Shares are up about 100 basis points. That's driven by strong performance in Europe, where we've seen record high shares, particularly behind the strategy of pushing our higher-end therapeutic brands on the premium side with Elmex and Meridol, as well as strong innovation on the Colgate side behind whitening. So, Europe delivering very strong. Africa, Middle East, we're up in 10 of 11 markets and market shares there. So, continue to show nice performance. Pleasingly, Latin America, where we, as you know, we have very high shares, shares are stable. We've seen shares growing in Brazil, slightly down in Mexico, but tracking up in recent periods. So, we're pleased with that. US in the recent weeks, we started to see some of the promotional volumes come back as we very thoughtfully put promotions in the market. We're not just going to buy share back for the sake of buying it back. We're going to get a much healthier category as we move forward, and that's been very deliberate in how we thought about that business there. Africa, excuse me, Asia shares continue to be strong for us in China, so we're pleased with that. And likewise, as you go around the region, share is pretty good in India. We've done some really good work on our core business in the last couple of months, and we anticipate that's going to inflect positive for our core business. Overall, pleased with pleased with market shares. On the Hill\u2019s business, likewise, very strong volume and value share growth in pet specialty and neighborhood pets, which is where we track. We're one of the fastest growing brands in both those retail environments. So, we\u2019re pleased with obviously the strategy of bringing innovation and the increased advertising support we're bringing into the business. A little softness on our home care business in the US and that, again, attributes right back to the promotional cadence, and we're addressing that as we move through the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question will come from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead. Filippo Falorni : Hey, good morning, everyone. So, clearly you returned to solid volume growth at Hill\u2019s and solid results despite a more challenging category. So, Noel, can you maybe comment about how your business is positioned compared to the category weakness that we're seeing, which seems concentrated more on the wet side and the treat side. And then just thinking about Q4, how should we think about the progression of volume in Hill\u2019s, considering you're going to lose some of the private label volumes both from a topline, but also from a margin standpoint. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes, thanks, Filippo, and good morning. So, again, a great quarter for Hill\u2019s, obviously with strong balanced pricing and volume growth in the quarter. That growth was quite pervasive across the world as we saw a good growth in the US, as well as in some of our emerging markets, and likewise in Canada. Category has slowed a bit, as you've heard from others. That's, as you mentioned, a combination of sustained pricing in the category over the last four or five quarters and agg prices still remaining high. And so, it's not to be unexpected that the volume would slow a little bit. As you rightfully point out, you've seen some conversion from wet into dry. That lowers the volume. You've seen, obviously treats, which is more discretionary. And you'll recall, as we said in the Q2 call, we don't have a significant business at all in the treats segment. And likewise, I would say the non-science brands continue to perform quite well, but are not immune to the continued challenges that that you highlighted in the category. But as I mentioned just a moment ago, we continue to grow share, and for us, this is a share gain. We only have 5% to 6% penetration in our largest market in the US. So, we have a lot of upside still, hence the reason why we continue to bring strong innovation in the market. Hence the reason why we continue to advertise very aggressively to drive household penetration. Likewise, we see opportunities continued in the prescription diet. Our studies show that only about 5% of pet owners are using a prescription product, whereas potentially up to 80% could be using it. So, that affords us an upside. We've talked about wet, obviously some conversion from wet into dry, but we have very low shares in the wet segment, which has been one of the historically growing segments. And we have plans, as we've ta talked about in the past, to continue to grow that. So, overall, we feel we're positioned well, but not immune to some of the softness that we've seen. But likewise, as I mentioned, we're very focused on driving share and ultimately expanding this business internationally. We'll watch the category carefully. We know our retailers are very focused on nutrition, and the science segment continues to perform well, and that's where we're putting our strategies in order to continue to drive penetration. Operator : Our next question will come from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English : Hey, morning folks. Thanks for slotting me in, and let's stay there. Let's stay on pet nutrition for a minute, but let's pivot to maybe the bottom line. Looks like gross margins for that segment down 360 bps this quarter, kind of bringing two-year to down 900, very consistent with what we saw last quarter. And I get the mixed benefits of the acquisitions. I get the plant startup expense. I get the inflation, like these are all, obviously factors that have been contributing to the pressure, but I'm expecting all of them to sort of subside as you start to rotate the product out of the Red Collar assets, as you start to pivot some of your resources from starting up plants to attacking some of the efficiency, and hopefully as some of the input cost pressure subsides and price catches up. But we haven't yet seen progress yet. What is a reasonable expectation for us as we try to level set our own expectations? When should we start to see the benefits of all those dynamics come to fruition? And how much recovery should we be expecting? Noel Wallace : Well, thanks for the question. Again, sequentially, things are moving in the right direction, and that's exactly what we've talked about in previous calls. And obviously, operating profit and EBIT continues to inflect where we want it. We continue to support the business with a disproportionate amount of our total increase in advertising, as we talked about. That is, again, strategic based on the low penetration and the real headroom that we continue to see in the category for us. As we see agg prices have somewhat flattened out, and that's good news for us, given a lot of the pricing that we've taken, we anticipate that that will start to inflect more positive in our gross margins as we move forward. As you rightfully pointed out, we have a significant amount of cost is still moving through the P&L on getting our new facilities ramped up. The new wet facility will start to ramp up here in the fourth quarter. So, we'll have some costs associated with that, but ultimately, over the longer term, those costs will subside and we feel good about where we are with the new Red Collar plants, getting those integrated in. So, overall, with pricing continuing to flow through, with agg prices holding and continuing to drive premiumization in the category, we feel good about the long-term trajectory of operating margins in this business. Operator : Next question will come from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Thanks. Good morning. Want to ask you a little bit more about North America, given that - a couple of things. First, the pricing accelerated on a two-year stack. If you could talk about the drivers of that. I assume promotion is a big piece of that. You mentioned advertising was up 25% in North America. Was that the highest amongst the divisions? And just if you could talk a little bit more about how you think about the ROI and the timing of the impact of that higher advertising. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes, thanks and good morning, Olivia. Again, as I mentioned earlier, we're pleased with the progress. Again, this is a very deliberate and strategic execution of how we're trying to get the health of our brands and the health of our P&L in a better place. And as I mentioned in the second quarter call, we may have pulled back a little bit too far on some of the promotional cadence, but we're adjusting that, but adjusting it very prudently where we see the ROI and where we believe we can drive sustained volume and share opportunity moving forward. The 25% increase was not the highest. As I just mentioned, Hill\u2019s continues to receive the disproportionate amount of the advertising increase. But North America, again, given the vibrancy of that market and the long-term strategic importance of that market, we will continue to invest for the long term. Great progress on the operating margins, as you saw move through that P&L. That is a reflection, again, I think of a much more prudent approach to pricing in the market and our promotional cadence. And we feel good about the sequential growth that we saw in the quarter and the sequential growth that we'll continue to see in the fourth quarter. Operator : The next question will come from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Had a question on ad spend. I think year-to-date now we're over 12 - we\u2019re running at a rate that's about a little over 12% as a percentage of sales. And so, given the increase that will end the year at, is this a good base to think of in terms of ad spend going forward, or would you consider taking up further? So, just trying to get a sense now if we've kind of rebased or if this is a new base in terms of ad spend. Noel Wallace : Yes, thanks, Bryan. Listen, it's not as much as a percent of sales. It's really about how we're getting - what return on investment we're getting for that. And clearly, you've seen that play through the P&L on the strong organic in the business, the continued growth on market shares around the world, particularly in those strategic categories that we're pushing more deliberately with the advertising. So, it's really about an ROI. And as we see that play back through the P&L, which we clearly are, we'll continue to invest. So, we\u2019re really focused now, I'll say, on making sure we continue to optimize that investment. We put a lot more focus on programmatic buying, a lot more focus on personalization and getting content right. You heard E talk about when we were down in Florida with regards to the importance of advertising creative and content development. So, putting a lot more focus to get better ROI for what we're delivering. So, not necessarily a percent, but overall, we\u2019re getting the performance through the P&L and through our businesses on the ground. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Hey, great, thank you, and good morning. Maybe just two questions if I could. One is to follow up and round up the volume conversation. You talked about line of sight to improvements in North America and in Asia Pacific. The other area of softness in the quarter was Europe. Just love some perspective on sort of your path to volume improvement in that region. And then more broadly, stepping back, I guess this builds a little bit on the question Bryan was just asking, but you've had just tremendous success this year in driving underlying margin improvement, which has allowed the AMT reinvestment that we've seen year-to-date. I guess, as you are scenario modeling and starting to plan for the year ahead, how do you weigh the puts and takes on margins as you look ahead? And what's your level of confidence you can continue to drive that underlying margin improvement to enable the investment should the ROI exist? Noel Wallace : Yes, good morning, Steve. Thanks. So, let me talk again a little bit on volumes. Globally, as you've heard from others, volumes in the categories tend to be down around 2% to 3%. This is a function, obviously, of the aggressive pricing that you've seen sequentially over the last three or four quarters. So, that continues to improve, and in my view, that will continue to improve as pricing moderates over the next couple of quarters and we lapse some of the aggressive pricing that we've had, certainly within our P&L. But from a category standpoint, there's going to be obviously a shift from more pricing-driven organic growth to more volume-driven organic growth. And it's very difficult to actually predict exactly at the pace that's going to happen by geography, because we've taken pricing, competitors taking pricing at different points in the year. So, over time, sequentially though, we see volume returning to a more normalized level, and we see pricing returning to a more normalized level. And that's more or less how it's playing out. Difficult to predict from geography to geography, from quarter to quarter.  On the margin, obviously, a lot of focus, as you know, across the business. We've got a lot of levers in the P&L now to drive operating margins and gross margins. Why don't I let Stan talk to a little bit about that. He's been very focused on driving that across most of our regions. Stan Sutula : Thanks, Noel. Steve, it's a good question on the driving margin. So, if you take a look at what we've been able to do with the income statement this year, the top to bottom, the flexibility and the strength on all the different lines, have given us a lot more opportunity to drive margin, and it gives us flexibility, and that allows us to react to market conditions and anticipate, and more importantly, invest in those areas of the business that can deliver value. When we look at all those collectively, we think that leaves us well positioned for expanding margin over time. And while we're not going to give guidance for 2024 here today, we think that we are exiting the quarter with a stronger business model here than we entered the year. Operator : Our next question today will come from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. So, in the release, or in the prepared remarks, you talked about some of the improvement in oral care toothpaste, specifically in North America, but I was wondering if we could talk a bit about home and personal care. The advertising spend, like you said, up 25% this quarter. Just curious about how that is maybe being allocated across the different divisions within North America, how you're thinking about kind of innovation in home and personal care. I know, Noel, you'd mentioned some of the promotional cadence dynamics improving for home care in the fourth quarter, but I was just curious at efforts beyond that to kind of get those businesses more on the right track. Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure. Hey, Lauren, good morning. So, overall, the bulk of our North America business is oral care and it receives the bulk of that advertising increase. But pleasingly, we are supporting our home care and our personal care businesses, which is important. And clearly, as we get the promotional cadence back on those businesses, particularly here in the fourth quarter, we anticipate we'll see an improvement in shares. Now, again, we had a lot of unprofitable share historically where we were chasing share and buying share. And we have deliberately, as we see great health across our P&L and the geographies across the world, we have the opportunity to right-size that in the US and get the shares much more profitable and get much more sustainable share growth moving forward. And the intention is to continue to support all those businesses in the US as we move forward. The other one is our skin health business in the US is getting good levels of advertising. That continues to perform well. If you take our skin health business outside of China, that grew double digits in the quarter for us. So, we continue to see a nice growth on that business, and we'll continue to support that in the US market as well. Operator : Your next question will come from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Chris Carey : Hi, good morning, everyone. I couldn't help but notice the commentary around the currency impact carrying into 2024. At the same time, Noel, you were quite clear in your remarks today that Colgate has multiple levers to continue profit growth. This year, you're going to be doing high single-digit earnings. It would appear on low single-digit currency impact. You, I think, put up the best productivity number on a basis point impact that we've seen in almost 10 years despite raw materials which remain stubbornly high. Well, I know there's conversion and other costs in there as well. But just as you think about next year, and I know you're not giving guidance today, but does your ability to still deliver high single-digit earnings this year despite the currency headwind, give you confidence on next year, especially because some of these drivers, like pricing, perhaps strong productivity and other levers at your disposal, remain available to you going into next year? So, thanks for any perspective on that. Noel Wallace : Yes, Chris, thanks. Listen, I'm not going to get into 2024, start predicting where things will evolve, but clearly, foreign exchange moved more negative in the quarter for us. And you've seen that obviously the dollar strengthening as we move into the fourth quarter. But as Stan rightfully pointed out, I think the important aspect here is that the levers within our P&L are better than they've been in quite some time. We have different aspects playing to our advantage now. Obviously, we're getting the pricing executed in the market. We're starting to see volume flow through over the longer term. That will improve efficiencies in our plants. As we've gotten our forecast accuracy improved in the plants, that allows us to obviously run more of our funding the growth, which obviously came through very strong. We have the productivity moving through the P&L. so, we're really trying to pull on all levers to give us as much flexibility as possible. Foreign exchange is obviously a big unknown as we move forward, but you've seen us historically be able to price against this. We obviously have some inflationary pricing in the P&L in the third quarter based on where we see the Argentine peso go, where we see part of the Nigeria foreign exchange has been an issue as well, and likewise in Turkey. But over time, the important part is for us to drive flexibility through our P&L so we can adjust to market circumstances in the most efficient and prudent way. Operator : Next question today is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yes, thanks, and morning, everybody. So, yesterday, a competitor of yours, sort of in certain categories, talked about refocusing the business on product superiority. Obviously, a large US competitor has successfully pivoted the business towards that strategy, with success in recent years. Curious how you think about, or would assess the portion of your portfolio and innovation that meets the criteria. Have you adjusted R&D as a focus, the spending towards these product areas? And as sort of a second question, it might be related, might not be, the issues you bring up with the H&H business in China. Maybe I'm na\u00efve in assuming that some of it could potentially relate to this, where you're taking prices up but not necessarily innovating. If that's wrong, obviously talk to that, but just kind of talk generally about what's going on there and how much is price, how much is other stuff. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes, thanks, Mark. Let me come back to the core of our strategy, which was innovating across our core in adjacencies and channels. And all of it is underpinned by science-based innovation, and that has always distinguished our portfolio historically, and we have absolutely dialed that up in terms of how we focus our R&D efforts across the organization. Good examples of that is obviously the growth that we've had in the whitening segment. We have, in our view, some of the best efficacy-based products in the category. We're very pleased with the growth that we've seen in whitening at the premium side with our peroxide-based. We've obviously moved into pens, which is incremental consumption opportunity and the opportunity to drive regiment and a premiumization. We've moved into our chair distinct strategy, which is anchoring science-based whitening through the profession as well. So, science continues to play very importantly into our growth strategy. And you've seen that play out in oral care, certainly seen it play out in in our pediatrician business, as well as very recently in skin health. And likewise, as we look at some of the innovations coming on in our home care business, we've seen some great innovation on concentrate, some great innovation on tablets in Europe. So, we continue to use science as a way to drive differentiation and certainly drive our premiumization. Specifically on the Hawley & Hazel business, as I mentioned in the second quarter, we took pricing. That has taken longer to actually get executed in the market, given the multiple levels of our go-to-market strategy on the Hawley and Hazel business. And obviously, you've seen a slowdown in the category in China, which has also come on top of that. But the good news, as we exited the third quarter, we saw the Hawley & Hazel business start to inflect positively, and we continue to see that as we speak. So, we\u2019re not completely out of where we want it to be, but everything is moving in the right direction. Conversely, the innovation behind Hawley & Hazel is very strong. Once we have that pricing executed, we'll come in with a good first half plan of innovation, and that will be science-based innovation, as I mentioned. The parallel to that is obviously the great success we've had in China with the Colgate business. The Colgate business continues to perform very, very well, growing share in e-commerce, the fastest growing channels, and that is driven behind premium innovation with real science-based structures to that. Operator : Next question will come from Rob Ottenstein of Evercore. Please go ahead. Rob Ottenstein : Great, thank you very much. I'm wondering if we can drill in on the US and maybe talk a little bit about what's going on in the non-track channels, kind of which channels are leading the growth and why do you continue - do you expect that to continue in the future, having a pretty big gap between the scanner results and the non-track? And then if you could put that also in the context of how you see the US consumer and the health of the US consumer developing over the next couple of quarters and any pivots that you may do or adjustments to potentially a weakening consumer outlook. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes. Hey, good morning, Rob. Thanks. Clearly, in the results, and you've seen the scanner data, which continues to be soft, and as I mentioned, we're addressing that more sharply in the fourth quarter. Our non-track business continues to perform exceptionally well, and that has been a strategy that we've talked about for quite some time. Those are some of the faster growing channels. We continue to invest in those channels. We continue to grow share in those channels. And overall, that's certainly leading to a broader-based healthier business for us moving forward. You talk Club. You talk some of the discount channels. You talk some of the e-commerce channels as well. So, overall, we think we\u2019re well positioned in the US to continue to leverage where the growth is coming from. The consumer continues to be resilient. I would say the promotional environment is constructive right now. We've seen a little bit of pickup in some categories, but overall, still below pre-COVID levels. And as we continue to be, as I said, very thoughtfully prudent on how we elevate our cadence of promotions moving forward, we feel good about our ability to continue to drive non-track. Now, I'll remind you that non-tracked are about 14% of the total company sales. And so, while very important for us in the US and the team there under Jesper's leadership is laser focused on addressing that, we're going to get that back to a healthier share as we move forward. Operator : Our last question today is a follow-up from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Hi. Thanks again, Operator. Hey Stan, just a question around inflation. I know in the press release or the prepared remarks, you talked about - or I guess the press release, talked about still several hundred million dollars of inflation expected for this year. Can you just give us some context of, is it the same moderating? Like, as we're exiting the year, just how we should be thinking about the trend on inflation? I know you called out inflation in pet. So, just trying to get a sense of whether or not it's - how it's trending. Is it trending better or worse than kind of where we were coming out of 2Q? Stan Sutula : Yes, sure, Bryan. So, as we said, our view on raw materials in total remains consistent with prior quarters. And we still do see several hundred million of gross cost inflation raw materials for 2023. But while the overall totals in line, there have been some shifts underneath that. First, agriculture has not eased. In some cases, it\u2019s actually gone up. That affects primarily our Hill\u2019s business. Offsetting that, some commodities such as resins and oils have actually softened a bit. But when we look in total, that basket is roughly still in line. And while it hasn't gotten worse, it hasn't gotten a lot better. The one we continue to watch carefully is obviously energy with all the volatility in that market. And then also just keep in mind, some of our raw materials are not pure commodities, but specialty, flavors, fragrances. Those tend to have less volatility. But I think if you pull back, our teams have done a great job driving productivity to mitigate some of that inflation. And you saw in our funding the growth, this has really helped us balance the margin. You combine that with RGM, and it's resulted in that margin expansion. So, if I got to pull that back, while that's been relatively steady in total, the pieces moving around underneath, that has - our gross profit in total for the company has gone up 140 basis points year-to-year. And that's a combination of that pricing in RGM has been able to more than compensate for the raw materials going through. So, as we look at that heading into the last quarter, we haven't actually seen a lot of change in the commodity basket, so we expect that to continue through the end of the year. Noel Wallace : Yes, Bryan, I\u2019d just reiterate, again, that 140, you add another 50 basis points for private label, and if you add logistics in there, which others include in cost of goods, that adds roughly another 130. So, north of 300 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. And that's terrific in terms of how we saw things ultimately playing out. And as we see hopefully a more benign cost environment over the medium term and our ability to hold pricing and continue to innovate at the high end, we feel pretty good about the continued ability to sustain high margins in the categories in which we compete. Noel Wallace : So, thanks everyone for joining the call today. Let me just close up by saying we really appreciate your interest in the company. We hope you agree that we have the strategies and the plans in place to deliver consistent, compounded profitable growth to drive value for all of our shareholders. And I would be remiss not to thank all the Colgate from all folks around the world who have delivered a very strong quarter for us in the third quarter of 2023. So, thanks everyone. We'll talk to you in January. Operator : Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's call. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Executive Vice President, M&A, John Faucher. John Faucher : Thanks, Betsy. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter in full year 2023 earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the Q4 and full year 2023 earnings press release and related prepared materials and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the Q4 2023 earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some thoughts on our Q4 and full year results and our 2024 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. Noel? Noel Wallace : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our strong finish to a very good year in 2023 and our positive outlook for 2024. Over the past two years, we've been particularly focused on sustaining our strong organic sales growth while rebuilding our margins and improving our cash flow performance. We delivered on all three of those goals this year while still investing behind advertising to strengthen our brands and building and scaling capabilities to deliver future growth. 2023 marked our fifth consecutive year of organic sales growth either in line or ahead of our 3% to 5% long-term target range. We delivered balanced organic sales growth, growth in all six divisions, all four of our categories, and with improved balance between pricing and volume as we exited the year. Volume rounded to flat in the fourth quarter and was up for the quarter, excluding the impact of lower private label volumes at Hill\u2019s. Our market share momentum is improving behind strong innovation, higher levels of brand investment with a focus on improving the effectiveness of each dollar spent. We're also seeing the benefits of our digital transformation as our efforts with data analytics continue to proceed. Our commitment to revenue growth management and the strength of our funding the growth efforts combined with our global productivity initiative drove gross margin expansion, double-digit-based business operating profit growth, and high single-digit based business EPS growth. We delivered these results while increasing the investment in marketing and strategic capabilities and absorbing the headwinds from higher interest expense, pension and tax. We drove greater than 60% free cash flow growth, allowing us to invest behind our brands, increase capacity and buy back stock. We also increased our dividend for the 61st consecutive year. I am deeply proud of the results Colgate people have delivered in a challenging operating environment. 2024 will offer many of the same challenges as 2023, geopolitical unrest, foreign exchange headwinds and a challenged consumer, continued softness in China, and a large number of political elections around the world. We enter 2024 with strong momentum and the plans in place to deliver in this environment, as well as greater flexibility in both our income statement and our balance sheet. As we have mentioned over the past few quarters, we're focused on returning to consistent, compounded EPS growth, and our 2024 guidance reflects this ambition. We will continue to invest to drive high-quality, balanced organic sales growth and with both volume and pricing growing. We plan to deliver our productivity to fund this incremental investment while growing earnings per share. This should enable us to deliver strong cashflow growth to invest back in the business and return cash to shareholders. I look forward to discussing our 2024 plans in further detail at CAGNY next month, so you can share the confidence the Colgate-Palmolive team has in our continued growth. And with that, I'll take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey guys. So just wanted to focus on market share results in Q4 and as you look ahead, oral care share was obviously strong again and you delivered healthy expansion for the full year. Can you just talk about your forward positioning on the share front in oral care? You've got a tougher comparison here. So how do you think about the sustainability of those share gains as you look out to 2024? And then a similar question on pet. Obviously some industry pressure points, can you sort of juxtapose your market share relative to those industry pressure points and if the unlocked capacity is a significant driver of market share opportunity in the longer term in that business? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Great. Good morning, Dara. Thank you. So let me start a little bit broader on the categories, particularly oral care. We're really encouraged to see the inflection of positive volume growth in the categories around the world. And in many of the regions where we had seen negative volume growth, we started to see an inflection of that towards the end of the fourth quarter in the category. So that gives us great confidence that the category and the pricing that we put in place is continuing to turn. And importantly, we're going to see that growth continue in 2024. As you bring that back to our business, a really strong quarter for oral care, as you mentioned, both from a organic and sales standpoint, but likewise, as that transferred into better market share growth. If I take oral care in general, we were up double digits in the quarter. That translated into strong market share growth, particularly in regions like Latin America, Europe, Africa, Eurasia, and you saw some improved scanner data in the US as well. I think this is a reflection of the core business strategy that we have in place, the increased advertising that we're putting behind the business, as well as a strong innovation pipeline that continued in the back half of 2023 and will continue in 2024 as well. So market share is around the world strong and we would anticipate that, that will see continued growth as we move through the balance of 2024. And I would caveat with some of that, obviously the markets will be challenged given some of the upfront issues I mentioned, but pleasing to see the strong volume growth in some of our bigger regions. If you take Latin America, particularly three strong quarters of strong volume growth, very much driven by oral care, but quite frankly, that was a cross section of all of our categories, and you see that volume improving across all of our divisions. So again, I think we're well positioned on that. Let me talk a little bit about pet, because I think there's some important context to our strategy and why what we're doing is different for the market and what we're doing is working for the marketplace as well. We talked about Colgate being the most penetrated brand in the world. We also know that Hill\u2019s is low penetration, so we will continue to execute a series of differentiated strategies on Hill\u2019s in order to continue to accelerate our growth on that business. So, if I take the three aspects that we think about for Hill\u2019s, reach, awareness, and conversion, reach obviously is a reflection of the strong advertising that we're putting in place to get the message out. With low single digit penetration on Hill\u2019s, we want to ensure the awareness of our superior science is well understood, hence the strategy to drive more TV spending, more digital spending consistently through the quarters. We're spending a lot of time on the effectiveness of that reach to ensure that we're getting the awareness of it. We're using obviously a strong professional endorsement that we have behind vets and continue to accelerate our science and our clinical communication with that key opinion [really] (ph) is critical to the success of the brand. And importantly, as we think about conversion, a lot of non-users in the category, as I mentioned I think on the third quarter call, 5% of consumers are using a therapeutic nutrition, but theoretically 80% should be using a therapeutic nutrition. So a lot of opportunity to continue to drive share. The dynamics in the category, hence you're seeing a little bit of trade down from wet into dry. I mentioned that on the third quarter call, treats have suffered. Now we're not immune to the category softness, but if you take a step back and look at our principal retail environments, pet specialty, neighborhood pet, we're growing share nicely across all of those environments, which means we're helping our retail partners grow category dollars. Penetration was up roughly 10% in the US, our biggest and largest market, so we're very pleased with the progress we have there. Yes, the category is a little softer, but we have the right strategies and differentiated strategies in place to continue to accelerate growth. Operator : The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Hi. Thanks, operator. Good morning everyone. Maybe this question both for Noel and Stan, just related to Argentina. I think there was maybe a write-down that ran through the other expense line. So if you could give us a little bit more color on that and how much of that may recur and maybe, Noel, just kind of stepping back, I think this week we've heard from a several other companies who maybe even rethinking how they approach Argentina given the devaluation. It's been a while right since we've had this kind of currency crisis in Latin America. So, I don't know, just your perspective, both short-term, how we should be thinking about it from a accounting perspective, Stan? And then, Noel, just how you're thinking about Argentina maybe longer term? Noel Wallace : Okay, great. Bryan, good morning and thank you. Let me talk again a little bit of history in Argentina. And I apologize to go down with an extended answer, but I think it's important for the audience to understand how we operate in these hyperinflationary environments. We've been in Argentina close to 100 years. We have an extraordinarily capable management team that understands hyperinflationary counting, understands how to manage the income statement and the balance sheet, understands how to prevent further devaluations on the balance sheet as we move forward. And that's a reflection of just years and years of experience dealing with this level of volatility. We can go back to 2001, 2002, which I think was the last major devaluation in the country. 2014 had one as well. So we're very accustomed to ensuring we're doing everything to manage the potential volatility in a market like Argentina, and that experience has certainly played out. We have always, always continued to invest for the long term in Argentina. We have manufacturing on the ground. We have good relationships in terms of our ability to access dollars. But importantly, given some of the limitations that we've seen over the years on the ability to access dollars, we now have flexibility in the business to import product into the country as well. So we're very attuned to the volatility. I would say on the flip side, good news that price controls seem to have been settled a bit, and we're not going to see as much of those moving forward. So we continue to operate in an environment where we can bring value to the consumer and take pricing in order to offset some of the significant transaction. Now, we're not immune to the devaluation. We'll see that ultimately unfold as we go through the next couple quarters, more on the margin line than the profit line, but ultimately we will make sure we get pricing in the market and that will take some time to flow through into the P&L. But overall, experienced team which I want to thank for their incredible diligence in how they do --they deal with the economic environment there and feel pretty good that we've got real control of what's going on in Argentina notwithstanding there will be continued volatility. So with that, let me give Stan a chance to talk a little bit about how we're managing more closely the income statement. Stan Sutula : Thanks, Noel. And, Bryan, let me start and pick up where Noel left off on the team. So as an example, we have a gentleman that I work with, Jose Fernando and he is my CFO for Latin America. But, he was also the CFO or the Finance Director in Argentina in 2002. So we have a depth of experience and I think that manifests itself with a very proactive approach to market conditions. So he and I talk on a very regular basis about changing market conditions, and then more importantly the proactive nature of what we do about that. So they've operated in a hyperinflationary environment for a very long time. They take the actions necessary where we look at the long term. So while we operate hyperinflationary environment, we account for it appropriately. You do see the impact of the devaluation and other income other expense. It was not the majority of that line item. So there are other items in there but we dealt with that, we delivered our overall numbers, we improved our productivity, we delivered margin expansion, profit expansion and cash flow. So I think the team's done a very nice job looking at it proactively and dealing with it decisively. So you mentioned on a go forward basis, obviously when you [de-val] (ph), your balance sheet gets smaller. We'll continue to take those actions going forward. We have a growing business there. So, going forward, I would not anticipate a major impact to our results from Argentina. Operator : The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you [indiscernible] and good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you can talk, Noel, a little bit more about marketing investments. And you elaborated just recently that you mentioned increased [marked] (ph) advertising. And are you also seeing a normalizing promotional environment in the past? You had said that you dialed down and you're reinvesting in promotional capabilities in the US. Can you comment on how you stand right now and how the category promotional levels are? And separately, if you can talk a bit about the supply chain changes that you implemented with the new leadership and also how your position in light of the disruptions in the Middle East and the learnings from the pandemic? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Great. Thanks and good morning, Andrea. So let me take the advertising and promotional piece, and I'll come back and add a little bit of context on some of the great work that Luciano has done as he's come into the new role. The strategy has been quite consistent for the last three to four years about our ability to build brands through great communication and great innovation. And you've seen that obviously flow through the P&L. And despite the fact that we have obviously grown and accelerated advertising meaningfully over the last couple of years. We've continued to deliver against our guidance and exceed our operating profit objectives, which is terrific. Well, that just gives you a sense for the health of the P&L today and our ability to continue to fund investment going forward, and that will clearly be our strategy. Now, likewise, it gives us flexibility to be very focused on the efficiency of that spend. And I can assure you there's not a discussion that goes by where we don't talk about reach and frequency, and the ROI associated with our spend, both at the digital level and the linear TV level. So we're very, very, very focused on the ability to drive more efficiency through the P&L as we accelerate our advertising. And as we said in the prepared comments, we anticipate to continue to accelerate the advertising into 2024. Promotional environment is very constructive right now. I would say it's about 75% to 80% of the pre-COVID levels. So it's come down. It's more moderated. We -- as I've mentioned, in second and third quarter calls, that we will be very selective on increasing the cadence of our promotions in some of the geographies where we may have taken a little bit too much pricing as we led in some of those markets. That will be prudent and thoughtful and focused in certain select markets. But overall, the promotional environment seems very constructive. And our objective is to drive category and healthy volume growth through obviously the accelerated advertising line. On the supply chain, Luciano has come in and really thinking about the continued transformation of that, bringing a lot of good ideas on automation and data analytics and driving network optimization. A lot of our focus over the last couple of years, particularly at Hill's, was increasing capacity, and you saw that through our capital expenditure line. That will moderate as we move forward with more spending being allocated towards efficiency and savings and optimizing the network and very much digitizing the supply chain and getting very aggressive on using data analytics to optimize our efficiency and our case field level. So overall, pleased with where he's taking the group and that team has done just an extraordinary job getting us ready for further optimization moving forward. Stan Sutula : And, Andrea, I'll just pick up on your last comment around the issues out in the Red Sea and the shipping. So we've been also proactive on that, looking at alternate methods where available, planning for the lead time disruption. And the rest of the supply chain has remained stable, so we don't see issues there. But we have anticipated longer lead times than planned appropriately for 2024. Operator : The next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please go ahead. Filippo Falorni : Hey, good morning, everyone. So, Noel, going back to Hill's, clearly, high single-digit top line growth, excluding the private label, discontinuation, very strong results in the quarter. As you think about '24, like, can you give us a sense of how you see the volume for that business evolving and also the pricing environment in pet food. And then at the margin line, you saw a pretty significant cost headwinds in 2023. Are you seeing any moderation on the cultural and protein side for the Hill's business? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Good morning, Filippo. Thank you. We see more balanced volume and price as we move into 2024. Obviously, we've had roughly six quarters of aggressive pricing, seven quarters where we've had to take pricing to offset a lot of the inflation that we've seen in agricultural products. To get to your second part of your question, we do see ag prices beginning to moderate, which is good, which over time, as we see the pricing settle out in the markets, we anticipate that volume will come back. But remember, this is the one category we compete in where we've seen prolonged inflation as we move through the back half of 2023. But we anticipate that will definitely moderate as we move into 2024, and pricing likewise will moderate, and we'll see a return to really continuing to drive that successful household penetration number that I shared with you earlier, which is obviously our ability to continue to support strong advertising. So overall, we'll see that more balanced growth as we move through 2024. And on the margin line, as I mentioned again, a more moderating cost. We're still lapping some of the strong inflationary environments that we had in the first half of last year. So that pricing that we've taken in the back half of this year and early in the quarter will stay, but we'll see the volumes start to come back as we move through the back half of the year more meaningfully. Operator : The next question comes from Callum Elliott with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Callum Elliott : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Really good to see the big uptick in brand spending this year and the success it\u2019s having on competitive performance and growth. My question is, can you talk about some of the other investment buckets outside of advertising and brand spend? I'm thinking R&D, CapEx, some of the more infrastructure capability investments that sit in the P&L. Where are you guys today now versus where you think you need to be? And what's the relative importance of these non-brand spend buckets in your view? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yeah, Callum, thank you and good morning. A good question because we've talked a lot about positioning ourselves to win in the short term, but more importantly, succeed consistently in the long term. And that has been a lot around obviously the advertising investment. But as you well point out, investing in other areas, specifically capabilities, our digital transformation would be at the forefront of that, training and developing talent, bringing in talent, ensuring that we're optimizing our agency and the talent that they have on that side. So that's an important part of ultimately building the capabilities to continue to drive the effectiveness of our spend and ultimately setting ourselves up for better data architecture and the infrastructure required to do that and do it consistently over the long term. So a lot of investment going in that space as well. On the capital side, we've had, obviously, a lot of spending on the capital side in terms of increased capacity. As I mentioned earlier, we're going to see that start to shift to a lot more optimization and savings projects moving through our manufacturing facilities. As I mentioned earlier, setting up infrastructure for our data architecture and our data transformation. So overall, these are all investments for the long term that we think will continue to play out and allow us to drive that consistent earnings growth that we talked about earlier. Stan, anything to add to that? Stan Sutula : Callum, the only thing I'd say is when you look at the face of the income statement or balance sheet, the absolute numbers, it doesn't reflect the one of our key jobs here is to allocate resources and we reallocate to those high-growth areas or the areas with the most potential. While that may not show on the absolute line, underneath the covers, that reallocation of resources, whether it's dollars or human capacity is what supports us in analytics and digital and data and S/4 HANA and to enhance all those capabilities. So lots of work under the covers to drive resource to those key areas. Noel Wallace : And I'd mentioned very indirectly tied to your question, is the strong cash flow, right? The cash flow is giving us the ability to have a lot more flexibility in how we invest across the business, and that is pleasingly up significantly as you saw in the quarter and the year. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Hey, thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about gross margin. It was obviously very strong in the quarter and you expect progress in '24. Maybe just some perspective on the work you've done to get here, the drivers this quarter. But then also, as we look at '24, I'm assuming from a year-over-year perspective, that expansion is heavily weighted to the first part of the year. But sequentially, how should we think about gross margin? Is the fourth quarter a high watermark? Or is there a sequential progress that can be made? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Let me top line, and I'll let Stan answer a couple of questions. Obviously, I think that pricing, I think cost, I think foreign exchange is obviously the big drivers in the cost line for us. So we've done a terrific job in delivering strong funding to growth. I think a lot of opportunities as we had the supply chain settling down, our ability to start ramping up a lot of the projects that were in many respects on the back burner during COVID. That has allowed us to drive strong funding to growth. We anticipate that that will continue as we move forward into 2024. The pricing has been a big part of the gross margin expansion that we've been very aggressive with over the last six quarters. Yes, pricing will be more balanced as we move forward. So you would anticipate that will be a lesser impact as we move through the gross profit and raw materials will continue to, I think, be inflationary, but far more benign than we've seen in the past and there's clearly a moderation there. So ultimately, hopefully, an opportunity for us. With that, let me turn it over to Stan to give you a little bit more construct to that. Stan Sutula : So first, we're very pleased with the progress on gross profit through 2023. We had sequential improvement across the categories driven by a broad base of innovation, productivity, that helped offset that commodity situation that we all had to deal with. Now as you think about going forward, coming off of Q4, there are a number of items that always impact the timing, Q4 to Q1. And this year, there's a couple of new ones with a little bit of Argentina, timing of some events worldwide, like Chinese New Year, the timing of when that occurs and where some of this price rolls through, roll through from 2023 and incremental new price. So as we go through the year, we expect that, that will expand, but not at the same kind of levels, obviously, as 2023. So working through that, the teams are focused on productivity. The balance of the top line will change from pricing being the predominant driver to pricing and volume and that productivity will help us drive the margin improvement as we go through the year. Noel Wallace : Yeah. I would just simply underscore that there will be a sequential impact at the margin line on Argentina as we will take pricing in the quarter, but that will take a while to flow through to recover the transaction impact of the de-val. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Please go ahead. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator and good morning, everyone. So I wanted to ask specifically about Latin America volume performance, up 8% this quarter, three straight quarters of growth. And I recognize that the comps are somewhat easy, but the growth is still really impressive. Can you maybe just unpack how much of that is a function of category growth versus share performance? And really, how does that inform your view on volume growth looking out to '24 in Latin America specifically? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Thanks. We talked about it, I think, on the second and third call -- on third quarter call that the strength of our Latin America business and ultimately, our ability to lead in pricing and then the consistent history we have of seeing volume return to the categories. And so if I talk at the category level first, what's great is we've seen all three of the categories in which we compete, inflect positively from a category standpoint. And you've obviously seen us growing quite considerably on the volume side, the last three quarters, which is generating good volume share growth for our business. So we're very pleased with the overall performance there. And based on where we see the categories inflecting right now, we're pretty confident that we're going to continue to see balanced growth as we move forward. We'll have to take some currency pricing for sure through the year. But as we've indicated before, we would expect the volume to come back in these markets, and that's exactly what we're seeing. If you drill down to some of our biggest markets, particularly Brazil and Mexico, really strong quarter for both those markets with double-digit volume growth for Brazil and for -- and strong double-digit growth for Mexico as well. So again, a clear indication that the strategy of putting in strong innovation across all price points, getting the advertising, which we accelerated in the fourth quarter, likewise in Latin America, is helping to recover the categories and drive good volume market share in that business. Operator : The next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Nik Modi : Yeah. Thank you, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to follow up maybe on the raw material packaging inflation. Just some more perspective. You cited specialty products, I just wanted to get some context around that and what exactly some of those elements are. Noel Wallace : Sure. Let me throw that one to Stan and he can give you a little bit more context there. Stan Sutula : Sure. Unlike the prior two years, we don't expect a material impact here. So we see modest inflation in 2024 and there are some areas like every year that go up and down. But there are some new ones this year, things like fish oil has increased significantly. But overall, we expect modest inflation. And so while commodities overall are off of their highs, they're still elevated versus pre-COVID levels. And we expect that as we go through this, there might be a little bit of benefit moving in our favor, but not dramatically. And the only thing I'd say after that is raw materials are one component. So we deal with conversion costs, we deal with transport and logistics costs, and we drive productivity across all these areas through our Funding the Growth program, and that's why we're confident on margin expansion for 2024. Nik Modi : Great. And Stan, if I could just follow up on Filippo's question. I think he was asking on proteins as it relates to Hill\u2019s. So you cited ag costs, but maybe just comment on protein? What you are seeing\u2026 Stan Sutula : Yeah. Pleasingly, at least at the current point in time, we're not seeing an impact to Hill's in total on an increased basis year-on-year. So we look in total around Hill\u2019s as ag has kind of stabilized here a bit as well as proteins, we don't see a big headwind heading into 2024 based on total for commodities for Hill's. And that's important, because as we drive productivity with modest levels of flow-through on price and the innovation, that will allow us to continue to expand margin on the Hill's portfolio. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Chris Carey : Hey, good morning. So I wanted to ask about productivity and maybe go down to the regional level. I think this was the best productivity in our model anyways, going back roughly 20 years. And so is there anything abnormal about this quarter, any pull forward of productivity? Or are we talking about maybe just productivity muscle continues to build here? And that this is something that we can think about being at a slightly higher run rate go forward? And then just connected to that, this was the best North America margin we've seen in some time. Was there any outsized productivity benefit in the quarter? Or are you just starting to see some easing costs and better efficiency relative to the stabilization we're seeing in the business? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Yeah, a little bit of all of that, quite frankly. Obviously, with the incredible inflation that we've seen over the last 1.5 years across the bulk of our commodity basket, we've had to obviously accelerate the funding the growth and the higher cost obviously have allowed us to generate higher funding the growth. As I mentioned earlier, a lot more efficiency in the plants and our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities to drive more of the funding the growth projects has likewise allowed us to step up a little bit of that funding the growth in 2023 that we historically had not had the time to do. So a bit of it will be symptomatic of the year and the opportunity. But I think the discipline that we've ingrained and the culture that we have ingrained at Colgate around funding the growth in parallel, likewise with the global productivity initiative that we put in place, has allowed us to generate obviously strong contraction in our costs overall. I wouldn't say use it as a benchmark for going forward. There will be a lot of moving parts to that, but we feel like structurally, we're in a better place on funding the growth. Structurally, we've managed to execute the GPI in line and slightly towards the high end of the guidance range that we provided earlier on that initiative. So we feel like we're in a good place. Pricing will moderate, so it's important that we continue to generate the strong funding the growth and through the P&L in order to generate the margin growth that Stan talked about. Operator : The next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Great. Thank you, good morning. First, I wanted to ask you a little bit about the top line, obviously, coming off a very impressive 7% top line growth in Q4. The guide for the fiscal year at sort of 3% to 5%. Can you just provide some perspective thinking about first half versus second half, perhaps the cadence of volume growth as the pricing contribution sort of begins to lap? And then similarly on EPS, obviously, a very strong '23 and Q4, talking about the mid- to high single digits. That, of course -- that range implies potential for growth deceleration in 2024. So just talk about what has to happen to get to the high and what you incorporate in terms of the low end and perhaps an incremental conservatism built into the guide? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Thanks, Olivia, and good morning. So as I said in my front comments, we believe we are well positioned to deliver consistent compounded earnings growth moving forward. And that's certainly reflected in our guidance in the range that we provided. We have a good strong momentum coming out of '23 and heading into '24. And I think most importantly, the flexibility in the P&L and the balance sheet has allowed us to set ourselves up for continued success. As we look at the cadence of that, we will see the balance overall change as we lap the higher pricing that we've had through the bulk of 2023, that will rebalance itself down to be sure and we'll see the volume come back in the categories. As I talked about earlier and ultimately, our focus on driving household penetration with the increased advertising and the market share position that we have. So we think we're in a good position. Comps will get tougher as you say, but we feel that we'll see the volume growth come back and will offer balanced growth throughout the balance of the year. Now recognize that we still have some inflationary markets, Argentina, we talked about, obviously, Nigeria and Turkey that will drive some pricing. We've got some flow through. Most of the pricing we'll see in 2024 will be pricing flow through. We are going to take a little bit of new pricing in certain select markets. But overall, we're going to see a much better balance, as I mentioned upfront. How that ultimately unfolds we shall see but we're definitely planning for more balanced growth as we move through the back half of this year. Operator : The next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hey, everybody. Good morning. Could you maybe just give us a kind of state of play in China, starting maybe with the market and then getting into new business specifically? Noel Wallace : Sure. Thank you, Kaumil, and good morning. In China, you've heard it, I think, consistently throughout the earnings season so far that there's a real slowdown in China, and we're not immune to that slowdown. I will say with respect to some of the numbers out there, we feel we've performed very, very well across Greater China. Our business roughly down low to mid-single digits and that was very much commensurate with the category declines that we saw in those markets. Clearly, on the skin health side, we've seen a more acute decline in the categories and therefore, a bigger decline in our business as well. Long term, the market fundamentals remain intact. And I think it will take some time as we move through 2024 for those markets to come back. Obviously, a lot of stimulus money, as you've read, going back into the market, but we shall see the impact that has on consumers and consumption. But we think we're well positioned. The business continues to build share on the Colgate side. We talked about the Holly & Hazel. We think we're now shipping more closely to consumption as we move through the price increase and some of the inventory allocations that we've seen across the trade and we've got a strong innovation pipeline for next year, but we will be thoughtful and prudent on our investment structure in China until we see the categories come back to levels that invite us to invest more. But we feel long term, a good market and the dynamics are there, but we want to be thoughtful in the short term. Operator : The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks, good morning. On North America, it was great to see volumes inflect a positive this quarter, and you called out growth not just in oral care, but also in bar soap, liquid hand soap and cleaners. So I know there's a lot of things that kind of contribute to that better performance. You mentioned more balanced promotions. But I was wondering if could you spend a little bit of time talking about innovation across the business and any plans for '24? And maybe also if you could talk a little bit about any plans you may have around hand dish and plans to kind of stabilize and regain share in that business? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Hi, Lauren. Good morning. Thanks. I can't really talk specifically to the innovation that we have in 2024. But I can say, obviously, that we've got a strong pipeline and a much more balanced pipeline across all of our businesses. The acceleration in advertising is thoughtful and strategic as well that we will support more of our businesses in North America. I think that's a reflection of the really strong operating profit growth that we've reinjected back into the business. So we feel like we're in a much better place to support some of the categories that had been declining in advertising over the years. So we feel we're in a good place to reflect continued growth on the volume side. Obviously, the pricing will moderate quite considerably in the US as we move through 2024. And we've got a strong innovation pipeline across the categories in order to ensure that we continue to drive market share. The other aspect of it is, as I've talked about, a more balanced cadence of promotions, and we will make sure we execute those very, very thoughtfully. We have no intentions on going back to the historical numbers there, but we feel we've got some opportunities in select accounts in select parts of the country in order to accelerate where we've seen competition be quite aggressive. So good position. Really happy with the health of the P&L. Really happy with the advertising that we put back in the P&L, which will bode well for the long-term health of that business. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yeah, thanks and good morning, everybody. Two questions for me. One, on North America. So global market share better, in North America markets for toothpaste a little bit weaker, advertising spend obviously increased in 4Q and for the year. How much is the right level? And is there a correlation in the US between advertising and volume performance? Is there more to it than that R&D, whatever, curious there? And then on the Hill's business, given the weakness in pet specialty channel, has it made you think at all about whether your distribution mix in terms of where the product is sold, is right at this point? Or do you potentially think about expanding that to other retailer areas? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Good morning, Mark. Thanks. So North America first. Clearly, we're trying to get much more balanced investment across North America. We needed to get the P&L, particularly the middle P&L in the right shape, and that was a strategic choice that we made. A strategic choice enabled by, I think, the broadness of health of our business around the world that has allowed us to obviously accelerate the investment in North America as we took more pricing in the market. So we have a strong innovation pipeline. We anticipate that we'll continue to increase our investment levels. This is not for the short term, this is for the long-term health of that business, which we believe to be a very, very vital market for our success in the future. And we've seen the benefits coming through across our overall consumption. See some -- a little softness in the Nielsen tracked channels, I'll say that our non-tracked channels are growing at 3 to 4 multiple of the tracked channels. So we feel the overall investment in its entirety is proving to grow the consumption and the sales that we need in that marketplace. So long story short, we think we're in a good position for that. On your Hill's comment, our focus is in the channels where we compete. And we believe we're a differentiated unique product that drives the premium nutrition side. Science clearly is the segment that continues to grow, particularly amongst pet specialty. We have no plans to expand distribution in the food drug mass. We believe that would deteriorate the brand and we have very unique distribution policies that require us to be in the channels that we're in. And we continue, as I've mentioned earlier, to feel we have significant upside in those channels and the brand penetration that I mentioned earlier continues to grow. So in a good place, no intentions on expanding distribution. That being said, as you know, the bulk of our business is done in the US. We will be very selective about market expansion on the Hill's business, making sure we get the business model right, making sure the vet becomes a core part of that expansion strategy because that would drive long-term sustainable profitability for the business. And so we'll continue to look for opportunities as we increase the health of that business and the expansion needed in markets around the world. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. Noel, I was wondering if you can talk about India for a little bit. A lot of the companies that we talk to are very excited about the market and see it increasingly vibrant. So perhaps maybe review your position there, market share trends, if you're seeing more opportunities and what your plans are? And then just a kind of a housecleaning item for Stan. It looked like there was a $0.07 impact on the other income item under -- on other income, but there were some offsets there and some asset sales and a value-added tax refund. If you could kind of just let us better understand exactly what's going on there. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks, Rob, and good morning. So India, you saw the results this week, very strong results across the board, 9% organic, continued strong pricing and sequentially better volume in that market. I would likewise say we remain very excited and bullish on the market in India. We'll see the continued return to the rural segment, the vitality of the rural segment, which will bode well for volume as we move -- as we look forward. The other aspect, which I won't get into a lot of specific details, we have some really strong innovation plan for India, particularly around our core businesses. And we're excited to see that obviously be delivered in the market and executed. The team is doing an exceptional job finding added distribution points to make sure that we continue to capitalize on investment strategy. So bullish on India, good results and sequentially right where we'd like to see their business today and setting us up for ultimately another strong year in 2024. Stan Sutula : Hey, Rob, let me pick up on your second questionnaire and other income, other expense. As we talked earlier, that is made up of a number of items, both from this year and last year. And Argentina devaluation is certainly an impact, but not the majority of it. We also have some start-up costs in there, some onetime items from this year and last year. What I would say is that's not a new run rate. That's not going to continue into next [year at] (ph) that level. And you should think about these as kind of onetime events in nature. So these change as you go through the year. Operator : The next question comes from Edward Lewis with Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead. Edward Lewis : Yes, thanks very much. Just wanted to talk on Europe. Another quarter of strong pricing this quarter. And looking back, I think it's 9.5% for 2023 or 4.5% in 2022. So just be really interested to hear how you're thinking about pricing over here because consistently, I guess, in the past, pricing hasn't been a big part of the story in Europe. Is this kind of a new kind of attitude we should expect to continue doing sort of more pricing in general coming out of Europe? Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Ed. Good question. We think we've learned a tremendous amount on pricing in Europe and really work closely with our retail partners to find ways to drive value and ultimately their categories. Clearly, a significant inflation over the last six or seven quarters, which certainly helped to take more pricing in the marketplace. But I think our teams have exited \u201823 with more confidence. Now there's no question as inflation declines in 2024, we'll get a much more balanced view of pricing and volume moving back into the P&L. But I think some good stories that have allowed us to really accelerate our innovation and drive real value in the categories by relaunching our brands. You heard Jean-Luc talked about that at Deutsche Bank Conference, and I think that continues to be a consistent theme. So a lot of learning there, not saying it's going to be a challenge as we move forward to get more pricing in Europe, but we believe we've got the tools and the vehicle is to continue to find ways to accelerate category growth and therefore, our margin growth in the business. Operator : This concludes the Q&A portion of our call. I would now like to return the call to Noel Wallace, Colgate's Chairman, President and CEO, for any closing remarks. Noel Wallace : Well, thanks, everyone, for joining the call this morning. We hope you agree that the strategies and plans we have in place to deliver consistent compounded profitable growth to drive value for all of our stakeholders is there. And let me particularly thank all the Colgate employees around the world for their incredible hard work and dedication to deliver these strong results in 2023 and thank them in advance for the results they're going to continue to deliver in 2024. Thanks, everyone. We'll see you down in Florida. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's call. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I'd like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Executive Vice President, M&A, John Faucher. John Faucher : Thanks, Betty. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the first quarter 2024 earnings press release and related prepared materials and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our first quarter 2024 quarterly report on Form 10-Q and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 3, 5 and 6 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the first quarter 2024 earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some thoughts on our Q1 results and our 2024 outlook, and we will then open it up for Q&A. Noel? Noel Wallace : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our strong start to 2024. I would like to make 2 points today on why we think we are well positioned to continue to drive shareholder value through delivering consistent, compounded earnings per share growth. The first is the importance of balanced top line growth. You've heard me speak over the past several years of our focus on delivering balanced organic sales growth, growth in all of our categories, growth in all of our divisions and growth in both volume and pricing. That's what we did this quarter. We delivered organic sales growth in all 4 of our categories, all 6 of our divisions and volume and pricing growth on a total company basis. The balance allowed us to deliver on a base business, 6% net sales growth on top of 6.5% net sales growth in Q1 2023 despite a nearly 4% headwind from foreign exchange. The focus on balance between pricing and volume growth allowed us to deliver solid volume growth this quarter, even with the continued volume softness in China and the expected headwind from lower private label growth as we transferred more Hill's volume into our Pet Nutrition manufacturing network. Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care each grew volume in the quarter with volume growth of 3% for all 3 categories combined. Our revamped strategy and increased advertising spending have allowed us to drive growth across a greater percentage of our portfolio and our focus on core innovation is keeping our biggest brands relevant and vibrant in consumers' minds. We still have work to do, but our balanced strategy continues to yield results, including continued growth in our Global Oral Care shares, which leads me to my second point, which is flexibility in the P&L. Our focus on revenue growth management and driving our Funding-the-Growth initiatives enable us to achieve a 60% gross margin in the quarter despite significant headwinds from transactional foreign exchange. Our commitment to productivity in the middle of the P&L allowed us to drive 30 basis points of overhead leverage while still continuing to invest in strategic capabilities like digital, data and analytics, all topics we discussed at CAGNY, and prudent balance sheet management allow us to deliver 18% base business earnings growth despite the year-over-year increase in interest expense and the impact from devaluations around the globe. And most importantly, despite an expected mid-single-digit negative impact from foreign exchange, we're guiding to mid- to high single-digit base business earnings per share growth. And we're doing this in the context of meaningful increases in brand investment that will set the stage for growth in the future. This is a testament to the ability of our team to consistently execute our strategy and seize growth opportunities while also preparing to better withstand the inevitable headwinds of running a global business. So with that, I'll take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Stephen Robert Powers : So really exceptional business performance this quarter, more or less on all fronts. But I wanted to drill down into your organic growth guidance raise for the year. It seems about half of that, that 2-point increase is being driven by inflationary pricing as an offset to FX and fair enough on that. But there also seems to be at least a point beyond that attributable to upside that you're seeing in real terms across the portfolio. So I'm curious if you could expand on where that upside is coming from versus your prior expectations. And if you'd say more of that is being driven by category growth or it's more being driven by your own market share momentum? Noel Wallace : Great. Thanks, Steve. I'd come back to the points I made in my upfront comments around balanced organic sales growth. I mean we're getting really good quality coming through on the volume line. You saw the 1.3. That was with the headwind of private label that we're obviously exiting on the Hill's business. and strong pricing across the board, mid-single-digit pricing ex the impact of Argentina. And as you point out, we're seeing nice share growth consistently around the world that's driving obviously that top line organic growth and the top line sales growth. But we're most pleased with, I think, is the balance we're getting both on volume and price. We're able to still get pricing, not just inflationary pricing, but we still have pricing going through the categories, particularly in some of the markets where we've had more inflationary impact from raw materials. Hill's would be a good example of that. We took some more pricing in the first quarter. The pricing has obviously led to good value accretion in the category and allowed us to drive some value shares. The other important point is we've seen really good momentum in our volume shares. The U.S. had good growth on volume share in toothpaste. We've seen consistent volume share growth, both in Europe and in Latin America across our portfolio. So it's really broad-based across the strategy that we're trying to execute, balanced volume, balance price, good initiatives through the innovation that we're putting into the market. And then importantly, is the continued robust investment. We're seeing that really pay out in terms of driving not only category growth in the markets where we're spending, but most importantly, allowing us to grow share in the categories where we're spending money. So overall, it's, I think, a reflection of the strategy and a reflection of the balance that we have across both price and volume. Operator : The next question comes from Melanie Schultz with Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein : Robert Ottenstein here. Noel, let's kind of maybe do a deep dive on Oral Care. Can you talk a little bit about the market share trends by region? And more -- a little bit more specifically, are you gaining share more from other international players that may have more similar type of products or local players that are maybe more idiosyncratic? And what are the key drivers to the share growth. Is it more the fact that you're increasing share of voice? Or are there particular product areas like whitening that are really engaging consumers now more than they did in the past. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Rob. It's a little bit of all of what you've just said. So overall, really pleased with the growth and the acceleration of market shares globally. You saw that -- in the prepared remarks. You saw that in some of the slides that we provided, particularly on the Whitening segment. And it's really a function of the strategy that we've been executing for the last couple of years and really starting to see the fruits of all that effort. So the growth is coming, obviously, from a good growth in Europe, which we talked about, we're at record shares in Europe, that's a balance between Colgate and our therapeutic brands of elmex and meridol, so good spending behind those businesses. And we're seeing, obviously, that translate into good share growth, particularly in some of the big markets across Europe. Likewise, we're seeing the benefits of that deployed across Africa, where we've launched some of those high-end therapeutic brands as well. North America, the scanner data has been improving as you've seen. But the shares will continue to be a bit choppy there as we move forward, given some of the strategic changes we've taken with some of the drug class that trade on the promotional environment. Latin America had growth in both value and volume. That was driven both from, I think, the mix and diversity of our portfolio across Latin America, both at the high end and at the entry price point, given the breadth of portfolio offerings that we have there, and obviously, the increased spending that we're putting behind some of the good innovation. So it's really broad-based, good spending, good innovation, across the board and importantly, a credit to the teams and their execution on the ground. And so we see that obviously continuing as we continue to hold investment through the balance of the year, and that share growth is coming from both the multinational competitors as well as local competitors. So broad-based across the board. We're pleased with where we are. We have more work to do, particularly in North America, but overall, a good performance. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : I had a question on the gross margin performance. And just kind of how to think about the path from here. We've kind of seen the sequential margin progression over the last 6 quarters or so. But in the prepared remarks, you touched on certain costs will increase as you move through the year. So just any thoughts on how we should think about the gross margin progression from here would be helpful. And then just within that cost savings, any commentary you can share in terms of how we should be thinking about funding the growth is in the context of a very solid start to the year. Noel Wallace : Great. Let me talk about more conceptually strategically, and I'll let Stan handle some of the more specifics on your question. So overall, as we think about the year unfolding, as we've talked about, I think, quite consistently, we'll see pricing start to ladder down as we move through the balance of the year, although we will get inflationary pricing, we still have some pricing that we're taking in some markets. And I would say we're deeply pleased with the revenue growth management efforts that we have around the world and the -- what that's delivering for us in terms of pricing in the market and driving category value. You've seen, obviously, the impact on raw materials in the first quarter. We'll start to see that elevate a bit more in the back half. And obviously, the significant impact from transactional due to the foreign exchange headwinds that we face. That being said, we feel very good about the guidance that we provided, strategically about growing gross margins in 2024. We'll get that through, obviously, the funding the growth efforts that we have, good mix in terms of how we're deploying some of our therapeutic brands around the world. Taking pricing where we need to take to offset particularly inflationary foreign exchange and obviously, a very focused on the middle of the P&L, making sure we continue to get leverage there. So overall, strategically, we feel good, but we'll see pricing ladder down. It won't have as much impact in the year to go as it just had in the first half, but overall, we feel good about where we are. Stan? Stanley Sutula : Yes. So I'd pick up that -- look, we're very pleased with the margin performance in Q1, up 310 basis points year-to-year and improved sequentially. We had a slight benefit from Argentina, but the overall underlying margin improvement was quite good. We've guided for margin expansion for the year, and we're confident we can deliver. There's a couple of headwinds in here and tailwinds. We talked about the modest raw material inflation, as you've heard from others as well. We expect that will slightly escalate as we go through the year. And then we've all watched FX. FX, the transactional impact has been bouncing around, but that will be a headwind as we go into the year as well. On the tailwinds, Noel mentioned earlier, we've got great revenue growth management programs in place globally, and we're seeing the benefit from all of those. And we have a proven track record on our funding the growth. We had a very good start to funding the growth. We've got a very good pipeline for funding the growth and the teams, I think, have that dialed in here as we go forward. And then importantly, we've talked about the return to volume growth. And in that, we get some scale benefits and leverage as that volume flows through our manufacturing facilities. So overall, we expect to expand margin. You'll see that on a year-on-year basis. I think as you think sequentially, that will be more modest, but we expand margin for the year, and the efforts around RGM and FTG will be able to compensate for the headwinds that we see in FX transactional and raw materials. Operator : The next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Filippo Falorni : So Noel, you mentioned in the prepared remarks for the Hill's pet food business that you're expecting sequential volume improvement throughout the year. Maybe can you give us some color on the puts and takes with the less impact from private label volumes in top line? And also, just any sense of the contribution from innovation expansion into wet pet food and any color on the trajectory of the business, would be helpful. Noel Wallace : So as we said in the prepared remarks, really pleased with the performance at Hill's in the quarter in what's a pretty tough operating environment. Volume was closer to flat ex the impact of private label and that was sequentially up, which is good. And we had very good pricing, as we discussed, coming out of the year in 2023 and our need to continue to offset some of the agricultural inflation that we saw in the back half of '23 moving into '24. Category volume overall has been a bit sluggish in the category, but I think what's most important is to see that the sluggishness has been more of a decline in treats and a little bit of conversion from wet to dry, and that's obviously important for us to think about as we strategically move some of the bigger part of our businesses, which are in the dry segment going forward. Really importantly, though, is the fact that we generated really strong share growth in the first quarter of the year behind the Hill's business. We're cross up in pet specialty, up in neighborhood pet, penetration continues to grow. We had both share growth in our Science Diet business as well as Prescription Diet. And I think this is a reflection of the continued strategy that we're deploying, great innovation, great partnership with pet specialty in terms of driving their categories and making sure that we have ample advertising to talk about the science-driven nutrition that we provide to the market. So overall, we feel very good about where the Hill's business is, that business grew high single digits ex the impact of private label. So we feel we're well positioned, but we're not immune to some of the sluggishness in the category. But again, as we've talked about in the past, we have low brand awareness and low brand penetration. So a lot of upside to continue to go after as we execute our strategy. Stanley Sutula : The only thing I'd add there is that the investment in capacity has also enabled us to bring in some product that was being co-manufactured before, which improves reliability and delivery and also will improve our margins over time. Noel Wallace : And to your point on, Filippo, on wet, obviously, there's some opportunities for us as we're very low indexed in wet. And particularly in segments like cat, where there's a lot of wet food consumed, we have an opportunity to leverage the new manufacturing that we have and get more formulas into the market and obviously, more growth for the business. Operator : The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Noel, we spoke to the underlying volume growth in all regions and your revenue growth management definitely sets you apart, but can you comment on how you see the consumer behavior, in particular in the low-end consumer in the U.S. and China, which seems to be a concern to some of your peers. And you have historically protect your price points and keeping consumers in the category, but I would love to see the examples that you may highlight by your team in the U.S. and in China and how they've been using this portfolio management to barbell between affordability and premiumization. Noel Wallace : Yes. I think as we've talked about, thanks for the question, the consumer has been quite constructive. I mean, we've seen obviously the significant inflation move through the category over the last year. We expected that we would see a return to volume growth as inflation became more benign and as pricing started to stabilize in the categories, and that's principally what's happened. Interesting to note that as you take the aggregate of our categories, by and large, the categories are still negative. So the volume growth that we had and delivered in the quarter, which suggests obviously, that we're growing good volume share. And I think that's a reflection of the broad-based strategy that we're deploying. One, we have good innovation at the top end of the category, particularly on the therapeutic side, whether that's in whitening, in the premium side, whether that's the Total Plaque that we've launched, whether that's therapeutic with meridol and elmex as well as a lot of big core innovation. We talked about the fact that a lot of our big core portfolio, particularly in toothpaste, is at that entry or mid-price level. And so we've spent a lot of time innovating at the core to ensure that we keep those brands vibrant and we offer consumers real value and real benefits as they come into the category or they're trading down from mid-price to perhaps entry. You've seen some of the sluggishness in China, to your point, come from the rural segment. Clearly, that consumer is a bit more challenged in China right now. The premium segment continues to be quite robust. But our Darlie franchise is well positioned longer term, we think, to continue to leverage some of the rural softness that we're seeing in the category and make sure that we drive share. The Colgate business had a terrific quarter in China. And that's, I think, a reflection of the move to the premium side of the business as we've really gone a lot more on to e-commerce with premium offerings, but overall, we're seeing, I think, a balanced consumer. The key is making sure that we're providing the reasons to use our products and the advertising that we're executing across the market is very, very important to, one, justify the price increases that came through the category last year, but really to drive trade-up in the categories to ensure consumers see the real value and science-driven benefits of our products in our portfolio. Operator : The next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Bonnie Herzog : I had a question on your ad spend, which is one of the highest as a percentage of sales among your peers. Noel, you touched on this, but hoping you could talk a little further about your strategy to continue to increase spend. And then ultimately, what you believe is the right level of marketing spend moving forward as well as maybe opportunities to improve ROI. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Bonnie. I'll start with the end of your question, which is we're seeing terrific ROI in the business. And I think that's translated into the results in the quarter. Obviously, good volume growth, helping to -- certainly above the category, share growth pretty consistently around the world in both value and volume. We're seeing our premium innovations take share, and we're obviously spending a disproportionate amount of our advertising to drive premiumization and category value. You heard Diana talk at CAGNY about I think a lot of the discipline that we're putting into our media spend on using data and analytics to really justify the spend everywhere we are, drive more personalization and return on that investment. So again, we're very pleased with the increase in advertising and ultimately what it's delivering. As I mentioned in my upfront, what's also terrific for the business right now is the broad-based spending we have on the portfolio. And what I mean by that is we've moved from exclusively Oral Care and Pet, which was getting a significant amount of spend over the last couple of years to making sure that some of our strong brands around the world are getting their fair share of the advertising, and we've seen a great return on that investment. Europe would be a great example of that. We're spending behind our Personal Care business in Europe. Sanex is just an extraordinarily strong brand there, the spending behind some of our innovations driving good share growth and good execution in store. So overall, that's having a pretty systematic impact on the business, and we're pleased with the results that we're getting. Moving forward, as I've said, consistently, I think, over the last 3 or 4 quarters, we will continue to invest in this business for the long term and building brand saliency and keeping our brands vibrant is the best way to driving that consistency. Operator : The next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Olivia Tong Cheang : I wanted to ask you a little bit about your organic sales guide for the rest of the year. Obviously, contextually understand why you wouldn't flow the 10 points continuing. But why would organic sales decelerate as the comp fees? Presumably, you're getting more pricing? Clearly, we understand that this is a very dynamic environment, but would love to get a little bit more color in terms of your expectations for the rest of the year because it sounds like you're very bullish on innovation, on pricing capabilities, and volume acceleration, et cetera. I would appreciate a little bit more color there. Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Olivia. So clearly, some of the comps get more difficult as we go through the year to go. We took obviously a lot of pricing. We'll see that pricing become more benign or slow in the back half of the year that will -- to be determined how much of that comes back into volume. The good news is the first quarter and some of the success that we saw in the fourth quarter, give us confidence that the volume is returning as we expected. The elasticities are in line with as we expected. So we feel pretty good about where we are. Again, I think the biggest differentiator here in terms of how we think about is we're only in the first quarter. There's a lot of economic uncertainty out there in terms of what's happening. We still see foreign exchange being a headwind. That will certainly have an impact as we have to take pricing in some markets. Interest is going to stay stubbornly high. We expect through the balance of the year. So overall, we're still early in the year, very confident in the guidance we've provided and the strategy that we're executing, but we want to make sure we maintain operational flexibility through the balance of the year to ensure we continue to execute the strategy that we've been communicating to drive consistent compounded earnings share growth. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Christopher Carey : One quick follow-up on gross margin and then a question on North America. So on gross margin, I think there was an expectation that Q1 would be down quarter-over-quarter relative to Q4, clearly, very strong delivery in the quarter. Stan, you mentioned a bit of benefit from Argentina. Or are you seeing better developments elsewhere, whether that's in commodities, perhaps some of the new pricing on Hill's or maybe you're over-delivering on productivity. So just maybe contextualize what seems to have come in a bit better there? And just on North America, it was the best volume growth in nearly 2 years. I realize Fabuloso was a benefit there. But Noel, you also mentioned needing to work on market shares. Can you maybe just help us understand the underlying momentum of the business right now and how to think about this going forward? Noel Wallace : Sure. Thanks for the question. Let me take the North America and then I'll let Stan jump into some of your questions around gross profit. Overall, the strategy in North America that we're executing, we feel good about it. We've been very focused, as we've talked about before on improving the middle of the P&L, getting gross margins back to where they needed to get to, getting operating margins where they need to get back to and reinvesting that into the business in order to drive market shares. The value shares, as I mentioned, we have been a little bit choppy and will continue to be a little bit choppy for the reasons I stated earlier. However, we are seeing better execution of our innovation and our promotional strategies, and that's helping to drive nice volume share in the quarter, both across toothpaste, which was up nicely and toothbrushes from a volume standpoint. So again, we feel good about that, and we still have a lot of work to do across the business, as we've talked about on prior calls, and I've got great confidence in Jesper and his team and the strategy that we're deploying with real patience because we know it's going to take some time, but we feel in the long term, we're going to end up in a much better place from that. The other thing I'd say is that non-Nielsen business in the North America business continues to grow at multiples of the Nielsen business. And obviously, that's not captured in the market share. So we feel good about overall health in the business, but we'll consistently continue to drive the opportunities that we see in the Nielsen-based accounts. Stanley Sutula : And Chris, your question on the sequential margin improvement, first of all, I'm pleased with that sequential margin improvement. Argentina was a little bit less of a headwind. And as you watch that FX, it's been very volatile. We've taken actions to address it, including sourcing changes, pricing changes et cetera. And then the team candidly executed really well. I mean we get a little bit of scale benefit from volume we get some improvement from RGM and the funding the growth was great execution starting the year. So we love the start to the year, and we know FX is going to continue to be volatile, not just in Argentina but in many areas around the world. So a solid start to the year, slightly better than we anticipated on a sequential basis, but pleased with the progress. Operator : The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about Europe. Numbers were super strong. A little bit of context around where you're seeing particular areas of strength and volume would be great. And then just any recent thoughts on private label Unilever brought up yesterday seeing a little more incremental pressure from private label in Europe. So I was just curious to hear your perspective on that as well. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Lauren. A great quarter for Europe. And again, a terrific execution from the team on the ground. Overall, really, really strong with growth across the vast majority of our business, and it wasn't just Oral Care, it was pretty broad-based. And obviously, as you saw, volumes inflected positively given that we're still getting pricing in the category. So pricing will ramp down as we move through the balance of the year. The big change, I think, is our investment strategy in Europe. We see real opportunities for growth, particularly in the Oral Care and Personal Care segment, as we execute some of the innovations that we have there, the meridol and elmex shares broad-based across Europe are at record levels and growing really, really nicely. Again, that is a shift in strategy and what's nice is we're getting the complementary growth on the Colgate side of the business, particularly as we're more focused on the whitening opportunity that we have. So a great portfolio of brands that we're leveraging, we think, more strategically around the region. So the market shares overall look pretty good. In terms of private label, as you know, private label has higher penetration in Europe than it does anywhere else in the world. We have seen some acceleration in some of the home care categories, whether it's dish liquid or fabric softeners or floor cleaners, but that being said, we continue to have good growth across our business, particularly as we -- as I mentioned earlier, broadened the investment strategy across a wider array of our brands in Europe. Operator : The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Stan, just had a couple of questions just related to cash flow. One, I don't know -- maybe I missed it, but if we have a guide for capital spending for the year? And then I think you refinanced or you funded a maturity in the middle of the quarter with commercial paper, just kind of curious there, did you just looking to pay it down? Or will you look to refinance that or term it out at some point? And then maybe just more broadly, as you're thinking about cash flow given where exchange rates have moved, interest rates have moved, just any other thoughts on how we should be thinking about like free cash flow conversion this year and uses of free cash flow. Stanley Sutula : Yes. Bryan, thanks for the question. So first, we're pleased with the cash flow performance, a really solid start for the quarter. We're down a little bit year-over-year, but I remind you, last year was a terrific cash quarter, and this was really driven by receivables, which were impacted by the timing of Easter. In fact, we've looked at the first couple of days of the quarter and that collection period completely brought DSO back in line. So we're very comfortable with that. So our cash profits really have been helped from the top line growth. And the net working capital execution, I was very pleased with what the team accomplished here in first quarter, particularly around inventory. So even with the Red Sea challenges and building up a little safety stock in certain areas, great execution on inventory. We saw the inventory days improve, DSO strictly timing. In regards to your question on CapEx, we had said previously that we expect CapEx as a percent of sales to be lower than last year. And it's really driven by [ Tide ] and Oxy, kind of coming online and that investment dollar is dropping off. If we look at our leverage, the strong cash flow and execution has allowed us to bring our leverage using the S&P methodology down to 1.8x, so an improvement from year-end. And to your point, we did pay back a bond here in first quarter of $500 million, and we did that with CP and 2 reasons. One, we had very good strong cash flow; and two, at some point, we expect interest rates will come down, though that appears to be sliding further out to the right, and that will help us keep our fixed floating back in balance. So again, as we look at cash flow, strong performance and as we think about that, it kind of goes back into the capital allocation, and I think you've seen that manifest ourselves in our strategy, that capital allocation hasn't changed, invest in the business, and you're going to see CapEx go up and down, we're investing in advertising. Return to shareholders, we had a dividend increase, and you saw our share buyback in the quarter and then M&A, where we look at options to improve our overall portfolio. Noel Wallace : Yes, Bryan, the only thing I would add is, again, picking up on the theme of flexibility, it's not only flexibility throughout the P&L, but it's having a really strong balance sheet that gives us the flexibility to deploy capital as we see the best return on that investment. And I give Stan and the finance organization huge credit and the discipline that they're bringing around the world to ensure that the cash generation continues to be robust. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : I wanted to go back to North America and the outperformance of these untracked channels. We can now start to see in some of the data, the distinction between the new and the legacy channels, and it's pretty stark in your business, in particular, Hill's specifically, but overall, there's just a lot more growth in those channels, I guess that they're smaller. But curious on your take on what is driving that, that exceptional outperformance. And how sustainable is it in terms of these other places like Costco, Amazon, et cetera, that's contributing to that growth overall, and I'm specifically looking to at Hill's, which is really doing quite well in those new channels. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks. So again, we've been talking about that for quite some time, and that has been, I think, a reflection of the strategy that we've talked about for 3 years, which is core adjacencies and channels and getting back to real focus and understanding the consumer journey across all of the markets in which we compete has been fundamental to making sure that we have strategies to capture and deploy our investments in areas where we think we're going to get the best return for that. And some of these emerging channels that are not captured by Nielsen are very, very important, whether that's hard discount stores in parts of the world. Whether that's the club store environment, where the value pack in large sizes continue to be a big growth driver, whether that's the ease and convenience of shopping online and some of the digital execution and understanding the digital shelf and the discipline that we brought to that, that ultimately is being seen through the success that we're having in those alternative channels. We don't anticipate that, that will change. I think as some of the classical brick-and-mortar retailers really up their game, and we're certainly seeing that across the U.S. markets where the big players are certainly becoming far more sophisticated and progressive with their offerings and their shopper experience. We're partnering with them to ensure that we're -- our brands are involved in that journey that they're on, and making sure that we're bringing our digital capabilities to the entire omnichannel environment and making sure that Colgate and the brands that we offer at the forefront of that. So it's, again, shopper journey the experience that the shoppers are getting, the value orientation on some of those channels and our ability to be much more targeted with some of our spend, and that's particularly related to the online retailers. Operator : Next question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Brett Cooper : A question for you on the competitive environment and outlook. It would appear to date that promotional activity and competition hasn't ramped to the extent that some of your peers and some of your large peers are looking to accelerate growth via reinvestments. So would love to hear first whether that assessment on the environment is accurate generally. And then your perspective on whether there's enough opportunity to elevate category growth via things like household penetration growth, premiumization and share gain to net higher levels of growth? Or is all of this reinvestment just the new cost of doing business? Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Brett. What's interesting is you're seeing -- I think you're hearing that a lot of the competitive set has focused on building healthy category growth, and that's two ways : one, with increased media investment and the second is with increased innovation. We have not seen a fundamental shift around the world to more volume sold on promotion. It's still below where we were pre-COVID. Now as volume becomes the important aspect here, you may see some players move to that strategy of doing more promotions. But overall, the category has been very constructive in terms of big players spending money on media, driving value to the categories through innovation, and offerings that are differentiated in the marketplace. And so it's incumbent upon us to ensure that our innovations continue to drive real value to the category and the differentiation in a very competitive market and making sure that we're using the analytics and the data that we have to drive balanced promotional strategies in the categories. We'll be competitive where we need to be. I mentioned we've made some difficult decisions in the U.S. business to not chase a lot of deep down in promotions, particularly in certain retail environments that will have a short-term impact on the Nielsen shares, but long term, we feel we're going to deploy that money in an effective way. And again, it's making sure that we continue to drive saliency of our brands and the health of our brands long term, and we do that through media and innovation, not necessarily through promotions. Operator : The next question comes from Alejandro Zamacona with HSBC. Alejandro Zamacona Urquiza : Just a kind of follow-up on Latin America. So given the strong organic sales growth in the last few quarters, what should we expect going forward? I mean, to what extent the consumer is willing to continue to accept meaningful price increases without giving up volumes. Noel Wallace : Yes. Again, let me contextualize Latin America. Obviously, a really strong organic sales growth quarter, with and without Argentina, there was good volume growth across every single hub led by Brazil, which was up double digits. If I take the last 4 quarters of Latin America in terms of volume, 0.5, 5.4, 8, and 6.2. So again, very consistent with what we talked about. Our ability to get pricing early in the market has allowed us now to see the volume return to the categories and ultimately into our business. Our marketing is really strong and innovation is very strong on the ground, and so we feel very good about where we're seeing. And that's been translated into really positive share growth for the business. So ex Argentina, very good organic growth. Organic up significantly in the region. I think you saw double-digit growth in Brazil, which has been terrific. Oral Care, particularly has been really strong in the quarter. That was up double digits, excluding Argentina. Shares in value and volume up. It's been quite some time since we saw both of those move in the right direction, and again, a reflection, I believe, of the strategy of increased investment and making sure that we have a breadth of offerings in that market. That is a market that's accustomed to inflationary pricing across many of the markets in which we compete. Being key for us is making sure that we continue to advertise strongly in the markets, and we bring real innovation across the entire portfolio that keeps the categories vibrant, allows us to work with our retailers to drive category growth and hopefully capture share at the same time. So overall, we think Latin America is well positioned for continued growth, and we like what we're seeing there. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Noel Wallace, Colgate's Chairman, President and CEO, for closing remarks. Noel Wallace : Great. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. Obviously, we're really pleased with the quarter and how we've gotten off to a strong start that we believe sets us up for continued sustainable growth moving forward and generating that long-term algorithm that we've been talking about for quite some time for our shareholders. Let me particularly reach out to all of the Colgate employees around the world for their incredible dedication and resilience and their hard work in really executing a strategy around the world and for getting us off to a great start. So thanks, everyone. We'll see you and talk to you soon. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. Welcome to today\u2019s Colgate-Palmolive second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Executive Vice President, M&A, John Faucher. John Faucher : Thanks Drew. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the second quarter 2024 earnings press release and related prepared materials, and our most recent filings with the SEC including our 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the second quarter 2024 earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some thoughts on our Q2 results and our 2024 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. Noel? Noel Wallace : Thanks John, and thanks for joining us this morning. I look forward to taking your questions in regards to our strong Q2 results. As part of our ambition to deliver consistent compounded earnings growth, we have talked about the importance of driving balanced organic sales growth - all six divisions, all four categories, and with a combination of volume and pricing growth. We have re-vamped our innovation model, leveraged our global strength across price tiers, invested in marketing spend, and scaled new exciting capabilities across the organization, all of which is driving brand health and household penetration. This is particularly important given the pricing we have taken over the past few years. Our return to mid single-digit volume growth this quarter, including growth at both Hill\u2019s and Hawley & Hazel highlights some early success from this strategy, and this is well timed. We are returning to strong volume growth as gross margins are expanding, which will drive the incremental gross profit that funds the investment in brands and capabilities while still delivering compelling bottom line growth. We\u2019re also using data and analytics tools, including AI, to track the effectiveness of these activities as we look to further optimize the return on our increased spending. This is a topic we\u2019ll be discussing more over time. With this combination of increased penetration and the continued success of our revenue growth management strategy, we have the plans in place to drive consistent, balanced top line growth. We combine that with the benefits of operating leverage, productivity and cost discipline to turn that into consistent compounded earnings per share growth. Along with strong cash flow to fund investment, dividends and share repurchases, we believe this leaves us well positioned to drive top tier TSR. Our recent results show the strength and effectiveness as we continue to execute against this strategy, and with that, I\u2019ll open it up to questions. Operator : We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator instructions] The first question today comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Please go ahead. Peter Grom : Thank you Operator, and good morning everyone. Noel, I was hoping you could give us a deeper understanding of the levels of investment and what drives the confidence that the changes you\u2019ve made over the past several years can sustain this improvement we\u2019ve seen. Obviously from an outsider perspective, it seems to be working given the market share is in the mid single digit volume growth today, but just as you look ahead, how do you sustain this momentum and continue to build household penetration from here? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes, thanks Peter, and first of all, happy birthday! Stan Sutula : Happy birthday! John Faucher : Happy birthday Peter! Peter Grom : Thanks guys. Noel Wallace : So let\u2019s get into the heart of the strategy, which I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistently communicating over the past few years, and that\u2019s really getting the middle of that P&L in a place where we could have a lot more flexibility to invest behind the brands. That investment certainly is helping to drive the strong volume performance, but more importantly household penetration, which ultimately drives category growth and market share. It\u2019s keeping that flexibility in the middle of the P&L, allowing us to pinpoint the advertising in areas where we see real growth. The international exposure of our business obviously is giving us opportunities to allocate money in regions and areas where we see great growth opportunities, and that was delivered in the quarter with category growth across all of our categories and all of our divisions. Keeping those investment levels where they are, continuing to find ways to drive the effectiveness of that investment likewise is very important. As I\u2019ve mentioned before and as you saw down at CAGNY, we\u2019re using AI and other tools to really drive improved ROI. We\u2019re getting much better at our innovation - that\u2019s certainly helping drive that consistent growth around the world, and the execution of the strategy, we think is far better than it has been in previous years. Overall, keeping the flex in the middle of the P&L, strong gross margins, and allocating that in areas around the world where we\u2019re seeing real opportunities for growth, we think will drive sustained, consistent compounded growth moving forward. Operator : The next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey guys. Noel Wallace : Hey Dara. Dara Mohsenian : Just wanted to focus on the long term top line growth opportunity in Hill\u2019s from here on the volume and pricing side. First, maybe just on volume, you\u2019ve added a lot of capacity in the last couple of years, you\u2019ve also got a lot of areas you\u2019re still under-penetrated in, in theory internationally - wet foods, small paws, etc., so just some perspective at this point as we look out over the next three to five years, is there incrementality in volume as you pursue these areas more aggressively, and how should we think about that? Then on pricing, obviously you\u2019ve had very strong penetration increases, market share gains on the Hill\u2019s business. In theory, that should support higher pricing over time, but you\u2019re also in a category environment with industry trade-down in pet and probably a tough CPG environment in general for pricing, so how should we think about pricing going forward? Can you take consistent pricing, maybe to recapture some of the margin compression if you strip out the higher marketing in recent years, and just how would you juxtapose that sort of internal momentum versus the external environment in terms of your ability to take pricing longer term, looking out over the next few years? Noel Wallace : Thanks Dara. You know, clearly a great quarter for Hill\u2019s, a strong performance across the board, quite frankly, and we\u2019re particularly pleased with the strong volume in light of the significant pricing we\u2019ve taken historically. I\u2019ll come back and talk about pricing in a moment. But obviously ex-private label, to see the strength of the volume and the pricing move through the P&L is extremely encouraging, particularly given the advertising investment that we\u2019ve put into the business, which continues to strengthen the brand. I think what\u2019s important to call out in the quarter is the real inflection on the margin line, strong gross margin, strong operating margin, and this is a reflection, I think of getting more volume running through the business and obviously seeing the leverage move through the P&L. But if I take a step back again and characterize the marketplace, clearly as we\u2019ve talked about before, low household awareness and low brand penetration overall of the Hill\u2019s business clearly supporting the strong advertising investment, and we\u2019re seeing that delivered in the quarter - penetration up, market share\u2019s up. We\u2019re were one of the fastest growing global brands in some of the pet specialty stores this quarter, so again I think a reflection of the upside potential we still have. When you look at segment opportunities, we\u2019ve talked about that in the past, obviously wet an area that we\u2019re under-indexed in, clearly seeing the ramped up capacity we have in wet delivering better penetration, better growth, better execution in stores as we\u2019re getting more wet SKUs on the shelf. That\u2019s obviously translating into more upside potential as we consumers obviously shifting into those categories. Overall, we think the balance of the business is where we want it, and we\u2019re continuing to invest aggressively to drive that household penetration. You couple that with a really strong innovation pipeline, we see that in the first half of this year and we see that moving into \u201925 as well, so we think quite frankly the flywheel of the business is working very effectively for us right now. Low penetration, low awareness, we\u2019re working on that and getting more effectiveness in our advertising spend, which we\u2019re increasing, and importantly getting the gross margins and operating margins back to where we\u2019d like them is allowing for the increased gross margin dollars to invest behind the business. International, likewise - we\u2019ve talked about the opportunities that we still see globally in the long term to take this brand around the world. We\u2019re very focused on the big core markets right now, but long term we see opportunities to expand into new markets. The last I\u2019d say is obviously the mix between Science Diet and Prescription Diet, we saw a good inflection on Prescription Diet this quarter - that\u2019s been deliberate, that\u2019s been a function of partly due to the capacity expansion that we\u2019ve had has allowed us to get more diets on the shelf, allowed us to provide more sustained, consistent deliver to the vet professionals on the Prescription Diet business, and we saw a good mix benefit of that in the quarter as well, so overall we\u2019re pleased with it. The category is a little soft right now, as you mentioned, as household starts come down, but as we see hopefully the U.S. economy starting to show some vibrancy, or at least for a softer landing, we think that will bode well for us. Pricing is an opportunity, given the strength of the brand. We\u2019ll continue to take pricing where we have necessity to do that. The good news is we\u2019ve seen a little bit of flattening on commodity pricing in the Hill\u2019s business, which is excellent for us as we get that pricing we\u2019ve had historically. We\u2019ve seen the benefit of a more moderate inflationary environment on input costs, and we get more leverage through the P&L as we see the volume come back. So overall, we feel like we\u2019re in a good position to sustain that moving forward. Operator : The next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please go ahead. Filippo Falorni : Hi, good morning everyone. I wanted to ask about the North America business - great to see the volume return to solid growth, but you also called out a more promotional environment, so maybe one, you can talk about the general promotional environment in your categories from your competitors and private label? Also from a cycling standpoint, I know last year you were cycling lower promotional levels. Is it fair to think that\u2019s going to continue in Q3 and then by Q4, you\u2019re going to have a more normal comparison from a promotional level? Any color on the balance between pricing and volume in the back half for North America would be helpful, thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure, thank you Filippo. Overall, organic growth in North America was roughly in line with our expectations, albeit more volume, which was really pleasing - I\u2019ll come back to that in just a moment, and a little less pricing than expected, although as you rightfully point out and as we said in the prepared commentary, this was due to comparisons with the year ago. If you remember, really strong pricing in the second quarter, high single digits - I think it was around 9%. We talked about it in the call in the second quarter last year, the fact that we perhaps may have pulled back a bit too far on promotions. We saw some of those promotions come back in the quarter this year, particularly in one retail environment where we didn\u2019t promote at all in the year-ago period, a little bit of mix change between some of the higher price retailers to lower price retailers also impacting price. But pleasingly on the volume side, which we think is very important for us in North America right now, we saw great improvement, and what was particularly encouraging there is we saw household penetration as a result of that. We\u2019ve talked a lot about that over the last four quarters, the importance of driving household penetration, and the North America numbers are terrific. Market share is more or less flat in value, but up quite considerably on the volume side - that reflects, I think, a much more targeted approach and a thoughtful approach in how we\u2019re utilizing promotional dollars to be very effective and prudent without going too far down the trap of over-promoting. But right now, we feel we\u2019re in a very good place with that. We did see some of the retailers lean in. There\u2019s been a little bit more lift on promotional coupons, a little bit higher but expected as we move through the quarter, and we expect that to continue through the balance of the year. As I continually say, at least if you look outside of scanner data, our non-Nielsen business continued to track at multiples higher than the Nielsen tracked channels, so again really, really pleased with the overall context of how the quarter we delivered. We\u2019re going to watch the pricing carefully, but encouraged to see the volume coming back quite nicely. Operator : The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, good morning to all. My question is on Europe - obviously nothing short of impressive that you capped your [indiscernible] there, but with that, some of your peers have been calling a broader deceleration similar to what has been happening in the U.S., so wanted to see if you are--as you exit the quarter and as you negotiated some of the shelf space and [indiscernible] in Europe as well, and how you just described some of the shifts into the channels in the U.S. into the low income or more affordable channels, or discounters, are you seeing this happening in Europe or just as you said, your pricing ladders and your innovation has been able to sustain momentum there, and how we should be thinking to the back end. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes, good morning Andrea. Much around the latter, obviously. I think we have seen some shift in the retail environments there, but again we\u2019re through the negotiations and I think what\u2019s particularly pleasing in Europe is the breadth of the innovation across price tiers and the breadth of innovation across various channels. That\u2019s allowed us, in our view, the deliver that sustained very strong growth. What\u2019s particularly pleasing is obviously the balance between pricing and volume there. We\u2019ll see pricing obviously come down as we lap some of the strong pricing we took last year, but the volume coming back into the P&L at such healthy levels was particularly encouraging for the business, and that\u2019s reflected in market share and in household penetration, as I said. The market share on toothpaste is at record high levels. I think the balance and effectiveness we have between the Colgate and the Elmex and Meridol brands is really taking stride now in the sense of getting that promotional mix right between the three brands, and we\u2019re seeing likewise on the home care and the personal care brands, some of the innovation coming to the market and drive good sustained growth. Overall, a great performance for Europe. We\u2019ll watch it in the back half, but right now we think the sustained market share growth that we\u2019ve had across all of our categories is going to bode well for the back half, and the volume coming back in across multiple price tiers is a good indication that we\u2019re in a good place to set us up for a strong back half as well. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi, thanks for the question. Noel, you mentioned sequentially higher commodity costs as the year progresses, and I was wondering if you could help us quantify it or tell us, is it material enough that you would have to make any kind of pricing actions, and if so, where would the hot spots be? Noel Wallace : Yes, let me let Stan get into the details, but strategically, obviously we think with the pricing that we\u2019ve taken and strong productivity moving through the P&L, particularly with the volume starting to inflect much more positively, we think we\u2019re set up well for the back half. We will see some inflationary commodity increases, at least in terms of where commodities are in the back half, but nothing that gives us tremendous concern, particularly given the strong margin profile that we have across the business and where we\u2019re seeing the growth. Let me have Stan give you a little bit more color there Stan Sutula : Thanks Noel. What we saw in the first quarter, we talked about coming out was that we had general easing on commodities, but as we\u2019re looking into the back half of the year, we do see some raw material inflation in commodity costs, as well as an impact from transactional FX. As we think about the components of that, there are some pieces here that are going through, but we do feel confident in our ability to offset those with funding the growth and productivity. I don\u2019t see the need, unless they move more dramatically, to take large incremental pricing. In addition on our margin as we look, even anticipating these, we expect that our second half gross margin should be up year on year at levels probably more similar to Q2, so overall I think the teams keep a good eye on this. We look at it on a forward basis, we\u2019ve already locked in a significant proportion of Q3 and we\u2019ll look at that obviously in Q4 as we go ahead, so while we\u2019re aware of it, we feel pretty well positioned. Noel Wallace : Yes, the one unknown there is probably foreign exchange, and you\u2019ve seen that obviously move a bit against us in the last three weeks, particularly the Latin currencies, so we\u2019ll have to watch that carefully, but we\u2019re on it. Operator : The next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Excuse me, Mr. Gajrawala, your line is open. Okay, we\u2019ll go to the next questioner. The next questioner is Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Bonnie Herzog : All right, thank you. Good morning everyone. Noel Wallace : Hey, good morning Bonnie. Bonnie Herzog : Good morning Noel. I\u2019m just curious to hear if you\u2019ve seen any noticeable changes in consumer behavior in any of your key markets, especially from the low income consumer; and then if so, what initiatives have you guys been implementing to ultimately offer more value for consumer to drive this faster volume growth that we\u2019re seeing? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes, thanks. I think overall, quite constructive around the world, and that\u2019s obviously reflected in the strong volume growth, and likewise the penetration and market share growth; but overall, constructive. I think a lot of the strategy that we\u2019ve put in place over the last couple years, and that\u2019s innovating against some of our big core businesses and making sure that we\u2019re deliberate about the innovation by retail environment, has played out well relative to ensuring that those consumers looking for more value-oriented offerings, that we have that disposable opportunity in our portfolio, and we\u2019ve seen that. I think outside of the U.S, the consumer has been quite constructive. We\u2019ve seen a little bit more price value shopping in North America, but nothing too unusual right now, but we\u2019ll have to watch that carefully as we move through the back half of the year. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve seen a little bit more volume on deal coming through North America, but nothing that\u2019s not in line with historical numbers, quite frankly. Overall, U.S., watchful; Europe seems to be okay; Latin America, again you\u2019ve seen the really strong volume growth over the last three or four quarters despite significant pricing, and so we\u2019re seeing a good consumer environment there. Africa, Asia, Eurasia, strong, again good volume growth, and pleasingly starting to see some good volume growth coming back out of Asia and India specifically, which is encouraging. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Chris Carey : Hi, good morning. Noel Wallace : Morning Chris. Chris Carey : I just wanted to go back to the North America business, specifically around volume and investment posture, so just two parts to this. I guess first, the negative pricing in the quarter, is there a way to dimensionalize how much of that you think is the year-ago compare versus, say, actions that you\u2019re taking in market a bit more offensively? Then just from a volume perspective, when does this volume number feel sustainable going into the back half? I know you have some compare dynamics in Fabuloso and in hand soap, but at the same time, I think in your prepared remarks you called out double-digit volume growth in toothpaste, which was quite a bit ahead of what we can see in the consumption data, so I\u2019m just wondering if they\u2019re both timing and also durable dynamics that you see in Q2 as we go into the back half. Thanks for those two. Noel Wallace : Yes, let me start with, I guess, the volume numbers overall. We feel obviously good strong growth in the quarter, largely toothpaste driven, but we saw it across all categories, which is terrific. We expect that to continue as comparisons in North America will be favorable for us in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, so volumes should continue to track well. Let me get into a little bit of dimensionalizing the pricing. As you said, most of it was the comp, as you recall we had 10% price in Q1, 9% price in Q2 last year, and we talked specifically, as I mentioned earlier, that we may have pulled back a little bit too much on promotions in the second quarter, so the comparison was obviously very, very favorable, and we needed to get the promotion cadence back to where we need to. We had one particular retailer, as I mentioned, that we had pulled out of last year that came back online this year, which was encouraging to help drive some of the strong volume growth, but again I think the promotional cadence that we\u2019ll see will be--or the pricing will be somewhat consistent with where we were in the second quarter as we move through the back half of the year, off a very strong year in 2023. Overall, what\u2019s most encouraging is to see the elasticity there as we put a little bit more pricing in the market relative to coupon and promotion. We\u2019re obviously seeing a great return on that relative to volume. Encouraging likewise, gross profit percent and gross margin dollars were up in North America, which is allowing us to continue to invest strongly behind the business, and we are encouraged by that particularly as we move in the back half of the year. Operator : The next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Thanks, good morning. I wanted to go back to Latin America, given that continues to be a very strong driver of your total company growth - obviously very strong volume, very strong price. But you called out Brazil and Mexico, so can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing, any incremental concerns within the macros there, your sense of how the consumer is behaving in those key markets, as well as some of the other countries given the overall resonating of the growth in Latin America? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes, great. Thank you Olivia. We\u2019re encouraged in our two largest businesses, LatAm and Hill\u2019s, both delivering really strong quarters, particularly at the EBIT line - LatAm up 50% on EBIT, Hill\u2019s up 20%, so getting the big businesses growing at that level is encouraging for us. LatAm obviously continues to be such a consistently strong performer for us. Organic sales growth was strong, we saw good volume growth across all of our businesses. Every country was positive in volume with the exception of Argentina. This was led by Brazil, which was high single digits, which is really, really strong, and four quarters of mid-single digit volume growth in LatAm, so overall a pretty good consumer environment. I would say Brazil seems to be quite strong. Mexico slowed a little bit in the quarter, we\u2019ll have to watch that carefully, but the rest of the region performed quite strongly. Oral care, as you mentioned, really strong performance, our market shares were up 90 basis points across the division, volume shares were up likewise across the division, so encouraged by that. The strong marketing and innovation that we put in, in the first half seems to be taking hold, so we think we\u2019re well set up for continued, consistent growth as we move through the back half. I would characterize the consumer environment as pretty good, and the innovation that we have, particularly at the premium side, seems to be taking hold on whitening and some of the core re-launches seem to be driving some good success in terms of household penetration. So overall, we\u2019re encouraged by LatAm and continue to believe it will be a great growth driver for us moving forward. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Hi guys, good morning. Thank you. Noel, I was hoping we could talk about pricing more broadly. It\u2019s been a topic already, but it\u2019s been the number one focus that I\u2019ve heard from investors today, and really not just for Colgate, not just for North America, but for the industry at large, given what we\u2019ve seen and heard from others, where arguably pricing is coming down faster than might have previously been expected, at least in significant pockets. It\u2019s not hurting your performance today - you know, volumes and gross margins are great, strong reinvestment in the middle of the P&L, as you discussed. But I guess the question is, if the direction of travel is lower on pricing, again not just for Colgate but for the competitive set, is that volume and full P&L performance sustainable, and how do you think about that? Noel Wallace : Yes, well listen, we know the market\u2019s been focused on getting back to volume growth, but we\u2019ve consistently talked about, and I talked about it certainly at Deutsche Bank in Paris, on the importance of that growth being balanced, that we were going to continue to focus on the strong revenue growth management principles we have in place, the price pack architecture work that we\u2019re doing, and the necessity to continue to get pricing in the P&L. Now, as the inflationary environment becomes more benign, obviously we\u2019ll see some foreign exchange transactional pricing that needs to go into the P&L, but we\u2019re going to continue to be very focused on finding ways to drive some balanced pricing through the P&L, and we think we\u2019ll continue to see that obviously in the back half of the year across most of our divisions. As I mentioned earlier, our revenue growth management capabilities are very, very strong right now, and that\u2019s encouraging for us, to find ways where we\u2019re seeing less inflationary pricing, to find ways to optimize category growth from a dollar standpoint. But we\u2019ve talked about it consistently that we would see particularly this year inflect more towards volume than pricing, but that being said, the 4.2% pricing that we generated in the second quarter continues to be very, very strong in the context of the marketplace. I think that talks to the strength of our brands and our need to continue to offset some of the inflationary pressures that we saw in the business. So overall, we\u2019ll see pricing in the second half come--be a little bit lower than where we were in the second quarter, but given the levels of raw material inflation and the benefit of FTG, we still feel good about where we are from a gross profit standpoint. Operator : The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Hey, thanks Operator, and good morning everyone. Noel Wallace : Morning Bryan. Bryan Spillane : First, I just wanted to extend a happy birthday to Peter Grom - we all love Pete. Second, just a question, I guess, as we go into looking at the first half and going into the balance of the year, and thinking about just as we fill in our models, kind of the base that we\u2019re using for \u201924 for next year. I guess Noel, you\u2019ve had upside in the first half, and I think last year there was some reinvestment, and I think as you started this year, you also spoke a bit about a bias, right, to balance the driving earnings growth but at the same time taking the opportunity when you have it, right, when things are good and you\u2019ve got upside to reinvest. Can you give us a sense of just maybe the scope of reinvestment that\u2019s occurred in the first half, and then as we\u2019re thinking about the second half, would that be your bias? Have you identified potential areas to spend some money back that you hadn\u2019t planned, and then finally in that, as we\u2019re thinking about that for a base for \u201925, is there anything we should consider with regards to the level of investment in \u201925, whether this would be a good base off \u201924? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes, thanks Bryan. Again, very consistent with what we\u2019ve spoken about in the past, and that is getting the flexibility in the middle of the P&L to give us the opportunities to really direct advertising in areas where we\u2019re going to get the best return on that investment. With the continued growth in gross margin dollars with the strong top line growth, that affords us that flexibility around the world, and at the same time, as I\u2019ve mentioned, we are all over trying to improve the ROI of that spend in terms of getting more bang for the buck and being very deliberate in terms of how we approach the advertising, not increased advertising for the sake of increased advertising. The ROI culture that we\u2019re implementing across the organization is very, very strong. Our intention is to continue to invest where we see a return on investment, and we see real opportunities for continued volume growth opportunities, particularly around household penetration and to build brand awareness, and we\u2019ll continue to invest opportunistically where we see those opportunities. I don\u2019t think there will be anything changing in the back half of this year. Our intention is to continue to invest behind the business and drive that top line consistently to drive the bottom compounding growth that we\u2019ve talked about over the last three or four quarters. Stan Sutula : Bryan, just to add onto that, if you look, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated a good track record here with our ROIC back over 33%. We\u2019re on a mission for consistent, compounded EPS growth, and we\u2019ll make those investments where we see the ROI, and I think our track record is pretty good here. We\u2019ll look to continue that going forward. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Robert Ottenstein : Great, thank you. First, a quick follow-up, just on North America. Given that you\u2019re returning to historical or normal promotional levels, would it be fair to say that you don\u2019t expect any kind of particular competitive response? Would just love to get color on that. Then my bigger picture question is it seems to us, and I think we see it in your results, that the consumer, at least certain groups of consumers are more willing perhaps than in the past to pay up for innovation and performance, perhaps more than pre-COVID levels. Is that in fact something that is true, that you\u2019re seeing? Why would that be the case, and is it perhaps in combination with better communications on your part in terms of making clear exactly how the performance is better, and maybe what\u2019s driving that better communications? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes, good morning Robert, thank you. Again, I think the overall promotional environment is constructive. As I mentioned, we may have pulled back a little bit too far last year as we pulled promotions out to get some pricing in the categories, and we\u2019ve simply re-balanced that to, more importantly, probably match promotional pricing than certainly to lead it. Our intention is not to lead the category on a promotional cadence that can\u2019t be sustained. Overall, we feel like it\u2019s more or less consistent with where we are. We\u2019ll continue to be very prudent and mindful on where we invest those dollars, and making sure that we see the volume and the gross margin where we need it to be to continue to sustain what we want to focus on, which is strong advertising building the brands and leveraging the strong innovation pipeline that we have. Now if I extend onto innovation, clearly we will continue to operate with a real focus on the premium side of the business, and we\u2019re seeing great results from that across most of our divisions, where some of our premium innovation, particularly in whitening, now with the re-launch of Total going into Latin America, obviously Elmex and Meridol at the premium side with some of their innovations, we\u2019re seeing great inflection on the premium side of the business. If you couple that with the strong core business innovation that we\u2019ve had - Max Fresh in India, a great example of that, we\u2019re seeing great core innovation that\u2019s driving real value oriented points of difference versus our competitors, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll focus on, making sure that consumers are willing to trade up based on the real strong proposition and the big selling idea behind that. We\u2019ve talked about the science and the superiority of our brands, and we\u2019re really trying to incorporate that much more into our messaging, to your point, to get the messaging stronger and the content delivery stronger. Overall, it\u2019s a combination of all of what you discussed, making us be focused on ensuring that we have the innovation pipeline and the pricing in place to continue to sustain that strong top line growth. Operator : The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. Good morning. I know you just mentioned Elmex and Meridol on the last question, but I wanted to ask a bit about that three-brand strategy in Europe and get just maybe a bit of an update on how you\u2019re managing channel reach, if you\u2019ve taken those more premium brands beyond the pharmacy channel in Europe, more countries that have been added maybe in the last few years that we\u2019ve kind of lost sight of, and how applicable that strategy in particular may be to other markets, because I think I recall that you were launching one of the premium brands in Latin America a few years ago. I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s progressed at all. Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes, thanks Lauren, and you\u2019re absolutely right - we launched Elmex in Brazil, and I\u2019ll come back to that here at the end of my answer. But overall, it\u2019s been a very deliberate strategy for us to really flex our portfolio far more than we have done historically and making sure that we\u2019re capturing what are the unique needs and the consumer journey in the marketplace, and what are the growing parts of the category and particularly the therapeutic side of the category, which is where we were not seeing the level of growth that we needed. Using Elmex and Meridol particularly across Europe to capitalize on that growth has been very successful. You combine that with the strong focus we\u2019ve had on whitening and multi-benefit in Total, as well as the Optic across the world, that gives us a unique combination of offerings to both the retail environments that we compete in as well as the consumer. The retail environment, we\u2019ve been very disciplined about how we take Elmex and Meridol around the world, first and foremost. We\u2019ve been very deliberate and selective on what markets we\u2019re going to put that into, we\u2019re not going to put it in for opportunity\u2019s sake alone. We\u2019re going to be strategic about where we do that, particularly where the pharmacy channel is strong and the therapeutic benefits are growing, and we have a unique offering to go get some of our competitors in that space. We\u2019re going to be very selective on how we continue to take that around the world, but we will take it to new markets around the world where we see that opportunity. The point is, I think, getting the balance between Elmex, Meridol and Colgate right, and Europe has been a great test market for that, where we\u2019re seeing very significant incremental growth across the whole entire franchise by being very focused on where we\u2019re going to take those brands and how we advertise them. So overall, we feel good about that. Professional was the other aspect, and really focusing on the professional heritage of the Elmex and the Meridol brands. We\u2019ve been very deliberate about going back to the profession, educating them on the science and the key point of difference behind the Elmex and the Meridol brands, and that\u2019s certainly led to stronger endorsement levels from the profession, which obviously improve the premium-ness of the brand and the loyalty that we have behind those franchises. Oh, and you had a question in regards to--let me come back on LatAm, Lauren, quickly. Brazil was where we decided to take that brand - again, a very strong pharmacy class of trade, where we were not seeing the incremental growth that we wanted just with the Colgate franchise. We came in with the Elmex brand in LatAm, launched it in pharmacies in Sao Paulo only, and then decided to expand that based on the success that we had around the country, and we\u2019ve seen that drive very significant incremental share in the pharmacy class of trade, so a great combination of portfolio offerings to the pharmacist in terms of being high end therapeutic with the Elmex brand, and making sure that we had the core offerings for the pharmacist as well with the Colgate brand, so it\u2019s been a great combination for us to leverage that portfolio. We\u2019ll use that as a proxy as we think about new markets around the world, but again a very consistent and disciplined go-to-market strategy, only launching in pharmacy, building the brand through the profession, and then finding ways to potentially democratize that brand as we move forward, but we\u2019re going to be very deliberate and very cautious as we do that to ensure that the brand is well established and well seated in the marketplace, based on its credentials. Operator : The last question will come from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yes, thanks, and good morning everybody. I wanted to ask a couple of questions, one more of a clarification on the North America commentary and the shift to lower priced channels. We can see in the scanner data these days the shift to Costco and Amazon, as an example, and the growth is eight, nine times what it is in the legacy tracked channels. Are you referring to those as lower priced channels? If not, I guess I\u2019m curious what\u2019s driving the growth. It\u2019s been there for at least a number of quarters now, so what\u2019s driving the share shift into those channels? Then separately, unrelatedly on Prescription Diet and your commentary around the supply chain flexibility increasing shelf space and volume, we started to see some of it in the pet specialty channel, but you still have a sign up there that says you need to have a prescription to buy the product, so I guess I\u2019m curious how that works in terms of to get on shelf, you increase brand awareness and it sort of sells from there, and if you could provide just the mix of the Prescription versus the rest of the business, that\u2019d be helpful too. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes, thanks Mark. Let me take the retail channel. This has been, I think, nothing new here, quite frankly. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been a huge inflection in terms of shift. You\u2019ve seen the non-tracked Nielsen channels consistently growing faster than the tracked Nielsen channels, and there is a value play there obviously with some of the club offerings. But overall, I think all the channels are looking very, very carefully at their value proposition and the price pack architectures and finding ways to ensure that there\u2019s a value orientation back to the consumer without losing, obviously, the great pricing that\u2019s come through the P&Ls or the categories over the last couple years. I don\u2019t anticipate those shifts will be anything different moving forward. We\u2019ll continue to see, I think, more consistent with where we\u2019ve been in the past, and we\u2019re well prepared to continue to capitalize on those shifts. But the encouraging aspect is growing the Nielsen tracked channels as you\u2019ve seen, as I mentioned earlier, the strong volume share growth that we\u2019ve had in the Nielsen tracked channels. We\u2019re encouraged by that -it suggests that obviously the innovation and the value proposition that we\u2019re offering to our trade customers to grow their categories continues to be quite solid. On Prescription Diet, again a great opportunity for us to continue to grow the Prescription Diet business. We\u2019ve talked about it in the past, where the Prescription Diet opportunity with only--less than 5% of pets are using a therapeutic nutrition today, and while our studies show, as you\u2019ve heard me saying--talk about in the past, that 80% of pets can benefit from the therapeutic nutrition, so we\u2019re very focused on making sure pet specialty, our vet partners, etc. have the plethora of offerings that we bring to the market, and the increased capacity that we have with Tonganoxie coming online and allowing us to optimize our network and provide more of our offerings to the retail environment on a consistent basis is playing out quite nicely for the brand, getting more of those recipes into pet specialty and neighborhood pet stores, as well as making sure we have consistent supply to our veterinary professions, where they recommend and provide that recommendation to their pet owners has been terrific for it, so we will continue to make sure that offering expands and making sure that we continue to look for ways to increase the mix towards Prescription Diet, which is a real benefit for the pet owner. Operator : This concludes the Q&A portion of our call. I will now return the call to Noel Wallace, Colgate-Palmolive\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO for any closing remarks. Noel Wallace : Well, thank you all for joining us today, and I just want to applaud all the Colgate-Palmolive team around the world for the exceptional efforts to deliver strong top and bottom line growth. Importantly, we\u2019re doing that while we\u2019re building capabilities we need to stay strong moving forward, so that\u2019s terrific work by all the team. But I remind us, as always, that we\u2019re only halfway through the year and we still have a lot of work to be done, so thanks to everyone and appreciate the great discussion this morning. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President, M&A, John Faucher. John Faucher : Thanks, Betsy. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the third quarter 2024 earnings press release and related prepared materials, and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2023 annual report on Form 10-K, and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the third quarter 2024 earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some thoughts on our results and our 2024 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. Noel? Noel Wallace : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone, and thanks again for joining us, as we report another strong quarter of top line and bottom line performance. Our strategy of delivering more impactful core and premium innovation, increasing our advertising spending and scaling capabilities to drive improved brand health and higher household penetration is paying-off through strong volume-led organic sales growth. You're seeing this best represented in the fact that we have delivered volume growth in all six divisions for the second straight quarter with 3% growth in developed markets and 4.6% growth in emerging markets. It won't be every division every quarter, but we believe our geographic breadth and category mix will enable us to better weather volatility over time, whether that's from economic, geopolitical or other factors and deliver organic sales growth in line with our long-term targets despite difficult comparisons. This will be well considered in our plans and it's why we've been talking about building our business model to deliver sustained, profitable growth even as category growth decelerates as pricing growth recedes. Our commitment to reestablishing our gross margin is paying-off in gross profit dollar growth even as we lap more difficult comparisons. We have used this gross margin expansion to continue funding the investment in advertising and capabilities, enabling us to deliver best-in-class volume growth, which is driving strong organic sales growth. And we believe the flexibility we have built into our P&L gives us the ability to turn that organic sales growth into consistent compounding earnings per share growth to deliver top tier TSR over the long-term. And with that, I'll open it up for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning. Noel Wallace : Good morning, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So I just wanted to drill down into North America. NA pricing was down significantly for the second quarter in a row, you\u2019d warned us about that last quarter. But just take a step back and help us understand the competitive environment you're facing and what your strategy is from a pricing standpoint? And how much volume payback you think you're getting, given a muted result in the quarter, albeit with some timing caveats? And just how that business is set up going forward as we look forward to 2025 and beyond? And hopefully, this isn't cheating, but I wanted to slip in a second question on Pet, which is mostly North America actually. But the Hill's performance is really striking relative to industry trends. Can you just talk about the sustainability of low-single digit Pet pricing going forward, given that difficult industry pricing environment and the market share gains with your volume performance, again, in light of that difficult industry environment? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Good morning, Dara. Thank you. So North America, structurally, we came in exactly where we more or less expected, a little soft on the volume, which I'll explain in just a moment. But what we're seeing is as category growth decelerates a little bit as expected and what we talked about in the second quarter. Volumes returning, but not necessarily as fast as we would like, but I think there's more normalization on the volume line. We expect that to continue to inch up moving forward. Pricing was in line with Q2, as you mentioned, and as we talked about in the second quarter with similar adjustments that we expect to continue as we move through the balance of this year into the first quarter. I talked about volume being a little bit softer than it was expected. This was, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, due to shipment timing on a couple of orders. We had the benefit of some promo moves from the third quarter, which we'll see a little bit more in the fourth quarter. And as you've noted that we've -- with the skin health business now in the North America, we obviously had the impact of lower skin health volumes, principally driven by China and a little bit of reduction due to some e-commerce business that didn't come through in the quarter. But overall, more or less where we expected. The team is very focused on obviously setting ourselves up for a really strong '25, a strong innovation growth plan that we have in place. And we'll see, obviously, the volume start to inch back as we've seen the category start to normalize more. But overall, the good news is, we've been able to weather some of the softness in North America with really strong broad-based growth across the business. You talked about Hill's coming in exceptionally strong. It was a strong performance for Hill's in the quarter. Strong volume, which was really encouraging given the impact of lower private label. So you take the private label up, we were up mid-single digits on volume and a really strong margin performance on the business. And we've been consistent with what we've articulated in the past, which is that we want to continue to reinvest that margin into driving category growth, and that's exactly what we're doing. A little bit of pricing that came through in the quarter. And we think we've got the ability as ag prices move around to take some pricing given the strength, again, of the brand in the market. We're gaining market share. We're the fastest-growing brand, global brand in pet specialty and neighborhood pet stores. So we feel good about where we are. We're continuing to expand that business into segments that we weren't aggressively competing in below, specifically wet. So overall, we feel very good about where the Hill's business is, and our ability to continue to drive strong, sustained growth behind strong advertising levels. Operator : The next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please go ahead. Filippo Falorni : Hey. Good morning, everyone. So Noel, I wanted to ask you some initial perspective as you start thinking about next year. I know you're not going to give guidance today, but you mentioned you feel confident in your ability to be in the long-term algorithm on a multiyear basis. So as you think about cycling those tough comparisons, what are the areas of the business that you expect could accelerate? Is it more innovation -- contribution from innovation and be better volume in developed markets, or maybe the pet food business? Just any perspective on how you're thinking about cycling those comps and areas of the business that could accelerate? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks, Filippo for the question. We've been talking for, I think, the better part of three years now on how important it is to invest in the long-term capabilities that we think are going to be essential to drive sustained growth. And I really attribute that -- ability to do that to the flexibility that we've built into the P&L. So what we're focused on right now is elevating and accelerating innovation, particularly H2 and H3. We think we have a continued very strong new product grid moving into '25 and '26. We've built gross margin flexibility into the P&L that allows us to invest back behind the business, that advertising level, we will continue to do that. That's the way you improve brand health and drive long-term sustainable share growth. You've seen the share growth really inflect over the last couple of years, as you\u2019ve seen global shares, particularly in toothpaste and toothbrushes continue to move upwards. That's a reflection of the innovation and the sustained growth that we have -- the sustained advertising growth that we have in the P&L. So a lot of the same, Filippo, continuing to invest back behind the business, drive household penetration where we're getting much better with the analytical work that we're doing to understand where those growth opportunities are, building per capita consumption in those markets where we see real opportunities, driving our brand through advocacy. So all the things that we've been talking about, clearly will play out in '25 and into '26. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi. Thank you. I want to know about Europe. Obviously, a very strong quarter, and a lot of your peers have been delivering strong results in Europe as well. But one of your peers said not to expect this on an ongoing basis. So I wanted to know if -- what's driving it? What were your market shares like, in Europe during the quarter and what do you expect going forward? Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks, Robert. Again, a great quarter for Europe. My congratulations to the team out there which is doing an exceptional job really focusing on the fundamentals. We've clearly put significant investment back into Europe, which we're seeing really play out in that sustained top line growth. Volume growth was terrific. We're getting a little bit of pricing. Pricing, we're not immune to the challenges of pricing in Europe. But the good news is, we move into '25 with much stronger market shares, good penetration across our categories, and a very strong level of advertising that's improved brand health. So again, very consistent with the theme that we've been talking about, reinvest behind those growth opportunities. Our Oral Care shares are at record high levels now. We continue to see growth opportunities there, particularly building penetration amongst very specific targets. The advertising levels across the business, not just in Oral Care or coming back in. So we're seeing more broad-based growth across the European business. But we're not immune to some of the softness and challenges that always seem to plague the European market long term. But the good news is the business is in very good shape. Gross margins are at very high levels. Advertising strong and market shares have been reflected very positively. Operator : The next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Good morning. Noel Wallace : Good morning, Bonnie. Bonnie Herzog : Good morning. I wanted to ask about your emerging markets business. Organic sales growth has been strong in these markets, but most of its been driven by pricing to offset FX pressures. And I guess, as a result, this isn't necessarily translating into significant growth on a net basis. So I guess, I'd be curious to better understand how you're thinking about these businesses, and ultimately, how we should think about the contribution of volume mix going forward? Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks, Bonnie. Listen, the emerging market numbers were terrific. Even ex-Argentina, very positive volume and positive pricing ex-Argentina. So we're encouraged very much so. Some of our larger markets, particularly Brazil, India and Mexico continue to perform very, very strongly. And if you look long-term strategically, this is where the growth is going to come from. I mean, there continues to be per cap opportunities, premiumization opportunities in those markets, which we think we're executing very well. I'm sure, we'll get into some discussions on Latin America, but they continue to perform exceptionally well despite some of the choppiness that we've seen in some of those markets, particularly Mexico in post-elections. But overall, the emerging market strategy that we have in place continues to deliver. So you go across the board, Asia, strong performance this quarter, particularly China. Our Colgate China business performed exceptionally well. India strong. Africa, Eurasia, despite some of the volatility of that division is going through, again, quite strong. So we think the refocus on some of the real basic fundamentals that we had to put back into the business on driving household penetration, making sure we\u2019re looking at the premiumization opportunities, getting gross margin back into the P&L has allowed us to get a lot more flexibility in targeting some of those markets. Now as you well know, there\u2019s significant volatility in emerging markets. We\u2019ve seen some of the exchange rates move negatively over the recent periods, and we\u2019ll have to adjust accordingly to that moving forward. But overall, we feel very good about it, but we\u2019re not immune to some of the economic and political issues that I outlined earlier that impact those markets. But overall, the underlying performance is kind of right where we\u2019d like to see it. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Grundy with BNP. Please go ahead. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congratulations on the really strong quarter and results year-to-date. Stan, I was hoping maybe we could pivot to gross margin. Again, strong in the quarter. We're seeing the pricing contribution start to step down here commensurately with lower level of cost inflation. Funding the growth continues to be quite good, has been for a very long time at the company. Without giving guidance for next year, can you maybe just help us think about the building blocks and how you're thinking about gross margin development over the next 12 months or so? And then relatedly, what that may mean as you're thinking about reinvestment further down the P&L? Thank you for that. Stanley Sutula : Hey. Good morning, Kevin. Thanks for the question. So gross profit, we're very pleased with the gross profit margin here in third quarter. And candidly, it was better than our expectations, up 270 basis points year-on-year and improved sequentially. As we've disclosed before, we continue to see raw material inflation, and you saw that in our gross margin roll forward. Also, we're going to wrap around on even tougher compares here on a year-on-year basis in Q4. So as we think about the components, I think the teams have done a really nice job of looking and driving, funding the growth to drive productivity, which will help us on the margin. And then openly, we also get benefit from volume. So as the volumes have been increasing, we get the ability to get more overhead absorption, and that's always a benefit when we think about the variances. Now as Noel talked about earlier, we expect that the pricing contribution will mitigate over time. So we're not going to give '25 guidance here. But I think if you look at our history, you would see that we drive funding the growth. We have a great program here to drive that productivity over time. And that funding the growth, combined with revenue growth management, will help us balance out that P&L. The model we continue to expect, which would be gross margin dollars will drive that profitable growth. We'll invest that back in the business through innovation, through advertising to deliver both top and bottom line. Operator : The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was just curious, if you could talk a little bit about the philosophy on advertising and reinvestment spending. Like, how high can you go? Is there a point at which there's sort of a diminishing rate of return? So whether it's not about '25, but let's call it '25 and beyond, as you've created this flexibility, Stan just spoke to ongoing productivity programs, funding the growth continues. So how do you think about that spending and making sure it's still coming back with that same ROI and it's not diminishing? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Good morning, Lauren. Thank you. We've talked about for quite some time. And the fundamental strategy within the company is obviously building that flexibility so we can reinvest in building our brands. I mean we've got great penetration opportunities. We've got brand equity and health opportunities. And ultimately, that's how you drive sustained growth over the long-term, is making sure that consumers understand our product benefits and are excited about using our products. And so we find -- as you see through the volume line, particularly, and we have a lot of internal measurements to assess ROI. But if you take it at the simplest level, continuing to drive volume growth and broad-based penetration around the world is the most important benchmark for us to ascertain whether our advertising is working for us or not. How high is high? We continue to assess this on a geographic basis. Are we getting the returns? Do we need to move money, which is new for us from one division to another where we're seeing better returns on that. I talked about Europe earlier. We're seeing exceptional return on investment with our advertising investments, particularly in Oral Care. We obviously have the flexibility to now put some more money into the North America business, which I think will benefit from that. But overall, we're getting better at understanding what's working for us. And particularly, as we look at some of the work we're doing around analytics and using AI to really improve our digital impact, that's going to have a better ROI for us moving forward. I would very much like to find even more efficiency in the advertising P&L. That will be a primary focus for us as we move into '25 and '26, is really beefing up the analytical capabilities we have around our media buys and making sure that we're really understanding what's working for us on a much more fluid basis than we've had before, so we can make decisions on an intelligent basis as quickly as possible. So overall, we're pleased with the advertising investment. We've been able to now support more of our brands broadly across the business, that is certainly helping drive overall health. And most importantly, again, we're seeing good penetration numbers and good premiumization opportunities through some of our innovations. So overall, we feel good about that. We're going to continue to invest as long as we see the top line and penetration moving. Operator : The next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kaumil Gajrawala : I'd like to follow up on that a little bit. I think it was interesting when you said better at some of the things that are working. Can you maybe just talk about some of the changes that you've made, maybe it's in being tactical on the advertising versus longer-term brand building? If you could just maybe get into some of the tweaks because when we see such a good result, especially, in some markets where CPG peers have struggled. It feels like there's a lot more going on, and if you could just give a little more detail on what's behind that, I think it would be helpful. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Sure, Kaumil. Thank you. Listen, over the last three or four years, our team here in New York, working really closely with our operating heads, has spent a significant amount of time in the strategy of the company. And what that really entails is making sure that we are collectively working together on prioritizing where we see the biggest growth opportunities. Historically, I\u2019d say, we were a bit democratic in our spending. We\u2019re now much more strategic and we are able to pinpoint where we\u2019re getting the best ROI, where we see the best growth opportunities. And the division presidents aren\u2019t afraid to move money around within their divisions and across divisions to ensure that we\u2019re putting our money in areas where we\u2019re going to get the best return for that. And that clearly is demonstrated through the volume growth that we\u2019re seeing across all six divisions. I think it really comes down to not only just Oral Care and Pet Health and Skin Health, but now looking at opportunities both in the Personal Care businesses, the classical Personal Care businesses. Bodywash had a great performance in Europe this quarter. They\u2019re supporting some relaunches with great innovation and advertising. Likewise, we\u2019re seeing some great opportunities in Home Care across Latin America, which had a nice Home Care result in the quarter. So it\u2019s broad-based support and it\u2019s making sure strategically that we\u2019re very thoughtful about where we\u2019re putting the money in terms of geographic. The second aspect of that is exactly how we spend our money. The media environments become far more complex. There are various platforms to choose from. We\u2019re being very selective and focused on how we spend that money. It\u2019s easy to get enamored with a lot of shiny objects out there in terms of media opportunities, but we\u2019re focused on where we can build reach and build the frequency accordingly to build brand health. And the digital teams here in New York, helping to share best practices around the world and getting that ROI up, specifically in the digital area across different mediums, has really paid out nicely for us. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Chris Carey : Hi, good morning. Can you expand a bit on what you're seeing in Latin America? You made a comment about Mexico and the elections, but in the prepared remarks there was also a comment about stabilizing and still positive. So just what's the direction of travel in Latin America, specifically Mexico and perhaps Brazil? And then just connected to that, you talked about some currency volatility and needing to respond in different ways. How do you think about pricing in this market, specifically, if the macros are stable, but maybe not as strong as they were a year ago? Just any thoughts on how you'd approach strategy in these markets over the 12 months? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Sure, Chris. Thank you. Good morning. So again, as you mentioned, really strong performance in Latin America, notably against tougher volume comps. We did expect some slowdown in organic sales growth, and that's what we're seeing, but very much in line with our expectations. So we feel very good about that. And the underlying health of the business, i.e., specifically market shares, Latin America had a terrific quarter. Pleasingly, if you look at that business on a two year stack basis, volume has increased sequentially for four consecutive quarters. So despite the fact that there's a lot of volatility, we're seeing volume come back into the categories. And you'll remember that we took significant pricing in those geographies over the last two years. So to see volume come back as quickly as it did and sustained is important. Now post elections, we've seen some choppiness in Mexico, particularly around the category that may be more of a normalization. We're going to have to watch that carefully and make sure that we're thinking about our spending accordingly in that market. But we've got a really strong innovation plan. You saw in the prepared remarks, we've relaunched Colgate Total, which is a very significant business across Latin America and affords us a very important opportunity to continue to drive premiumization. But behind, what we think is the best formula that we've ever put in the market on Colgate Total and one that we are very excited about seeing the results of that across Latin America. But again, pricing up ex Argentina. So if foreign exchange continues to move against us, the strength of the brands and the support that we put behind that business, we think we can take more pricing in those markets to help offset that. But we're not immune to some of the sluggish and the foreign exchange that hits those markets, as you well know. I talked about Mexico at Barclays. And overall, I think we continue to have a very strong performance there. But the sluggishness that we're seeing across some of the categories as we ended the quarter, we need to watch that carefully. And I think, again, the team is very well positioned to execute based on what we see. So overall, good. Brazil, a terrific quarter for Brazil despite obviously some -- a little bit of uncertainty in those markets that continues to plague them, but I feel good about what we're seeing coming out of Brazil across the rest of the region. The performance continues to be quite strong. This is the team that knows how to execute in volatile environments, knows how to continue to drive penetration and premiumization. So I feel pretty confident that while \u2013 despite the lack of aggressive pricing, given the inflationary pressures, we will still get some foreign exchange pricing in the business over the subsequent quarters. Operator : The next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask you broadly about affordability given the macro environment, particularly in North America, but I think this is relevant to all markets. And as consumers continue to scrutinize your spending, can you talk about some of the initiatives that you have that help with respect to either promotional plans or at mid-tier price points with product? Just sort of thinking about the broader picture and how consumers are thinking about their total basket spend and actions that you're taking to maintain, if not grow share in that backdrop? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Olivia. So again, let me come back to strategy. Our strategy has been to accelerate our innovation, particularly on the premium side of the business, which providing value add benefits to the big core businesses that we have around the world, supporting that with advertising and ultimately, getting the brand penetration and share growth. Our volume shares performed well in the quarter in general across the world. Likewise, our value shares. We saw, obviously, toothpaste performed quite well in that regard. So overall, again, the consumer may be a little bit challenged, particularly in North America, it's making sure that we continue to dial up our innovation and provide real added value for -- across the multiple price tiers in which we compete. The other aspect of that is making sure that you are very thoughtfully thinking about your promotional cadence and how you promote your digital coupon strategy, your paper coupon strategy, your promotions, on-pack promotions, your price pack architectures. All of those are critically important in making sure that we have the analytics to really determine what's going to drive category growth for our retailers and continue to drive performance for our business. I was just reviewing the other day some incredible work that we're doing with some of the retailers in the U.S. with real AI and analytics around our promotions and seeing great results for that. So I think the point is, yes, the environment is a little bit more competitive. Coupon redemption rates are up. Promotions seem to be more or less in line, which I would say, normalized. Still not back to the pre-COVID levels, which is good, but more or less normalized. And ultimately, it\u2019s making sure that we\u2019re spending our money as thoughtfully as we possibly can to get the best ROI. But I would say a more normalized consumer, slightly higher promotional redemption rates behind coupons. But across the world, it\u2019s pretty consistent in terms of where we were post COVID. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. Terrific results, Noel. So if you, I think, stand back and listen to at least three or four of the questions, I think the underlying question is, why are you guys doing so well in so many places? And it's -- and I think is it just that, hey, you're spending more -- you can spend more money, you've got the data, so you're spending it in the right places. And that's kind of a very broad sort of the answer. But what I'd like to do is drill down a little bit more on that point and see -- and maybe just talk about Oral Care. How much of your success is driven by technology, by the whitening initiatives and then marketing that or other specialties? Just trying to get a sense of things that can drive sustainable, continued market share gains that go beyond just spending more money in marketing. And I know that's going on, but I just want to give you the chance to talk about that a little bit more. And then also, if we had the time, looking at what you're doing in China, which is just -- you're just being much more successful than anybody else at this point and how that model applies to that very tough market. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Great. Good morning, Rob. Thanks. Thanks for the question. So again, it comes back, I think, with just consistency of performance in our focused categories around the world and our ability to really dial in on where we see the growth opportunities. We've spent a lot of time talking about building capabilities. And I really want to emphasize that because you don't necessarily see the immediate impact in the quarter, but those capabilities are all intended on building long-term, sustainable health behind our business. So it's innovation. It's digital, It's our advertising return on investment. It's our data acquisition and using data to drive better decision-making. It's making sure that our innovation across H2 and H3 is where it needs to be. Making sure the core is where it needs to be. Making sure that we're addressing new channel behaviors. But it's all the basics that we've been talking about and making sure then that we invest accordingly. And we had to get the middle of the P&L addressed to do that. So we deliberately took a lot of pricing over the last three years to get our categories where they needed to get to. And then ultimately, that is paid out in allowing us to really invest consistently behind our brands. And we measure internally our brand health, the health of our equities, and they are in a really good place, and that's what we want to continue to build. Now we're not immune to what everyone is talking about. Clearly, we're going to see some divisions take a step back. But the breadth of our business and our geographic footprint, we believe, allows us to weather some of these -- the volatility that you're seeing referring to Better than Most, and we want to continue to do that. But we can't be complacent. We need to build more capabilities and sharpen those as we move forward. We need to continue to address the opportunities we see in certain geographies where we think there's real growth for us there. But again, it's a deliberate, thoughtful approach to this business. We're going to be consistent. We're not going to necessarily try to hit home runs, a lot of singles to take a sports analogy. But making sure that we do that in a way that drives broad-based growth over time. So again, a lot of the strategy, Rob, particularly on Oral Care. To your question, we think the focus on premiumization, the great new product innovations that we brought on whitening adjacencies, we now have Colgate Total rolling out in Latin America with some significant new innovation behind the core. You heard about some of the great technology that we're bringing into Max Fresh across India and some of the Southeast Asia markets, that will continue to roll out. So again, the stepped-up innovation and resources that we're putting behind that will ultimately play out. On China specifically, it should be said that we had some pretty easy comps. But that being said, our China business continues to perform really, really well. I'll talk to Colgate first and then the Hawley & Hazel business. The Colgate business continues to do very well, up high single digits, driven primarily by premiumization. Great innovation across the calendar moving forward. We're improving our brand health behind some of the investment that I referred to. And overall, we're getting a good mix of volume and pricing against tougher comps on the Colgate side. Hawley & Hazel, as you know, has come out of quite a few quarters of challenged growth. We're starting to see that come back nicely, which is good, but not where we need to be yet. So we still have room for opportunity. We are looking at our go-to-market approach on Hawley & Hazel moving forward. That team is really deliberately thinking about how we want to be structured over the next couple of years to ensure that we can continue to invest in a very competitive market and drive sustained volume and value growth for the business. But overall, pleased with the China performance, but we\u2019re not immune to the slowdown that we\u2019re seeing across that business. But we think the consistent performance behind our innovation and supporting those business will drive sustained growth moving forward. Operator : The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, good morning. My question is what was the exit rate for organic sales growth in the quarter and what is embedded in your guidance for Q4? Because even if the guidance raise is a wide range. And Noel, from your tone on this call, it seems that you're supposed to keep the pace of 6% globally. So in other words, if you current trends continue, is that the way we should be thinking, that the top of the range would be that embedded around 6%? And if I can squeeze a clarification on Hill\u2019s. Can you comment now on the potential for more international expansion with more capacity into 2025? Thank you for both. Noel Wallace : Great. Andrea, good morning. Thank you. Listen, we don't guide by quarter, so I don't want to get into the specifics. But I do think we're -- we feel pretty good about the underlying health of where the quarter came in. So overall, we're good. And as I said in my upfront comments, we think we're positioned for consistent growth. But we're not, again, as I mentioned, immune to some of the issues that many of the CPG companies have talked about throughout the earnings season. But that's reflected in our guidance. And I think you see that in our numbers and the guidance for itself in terms of where we think we\u2019ll be. Obviously, we\u2019ve seen a little slowdown, a little move in foreign exchange. We\u2019ll see ultimately where the categories unfold as we exit the year. But overall, we feel like we\u2019re in a pretty good position. On Hill\u2019s capacity, that is continuing to obviously allow a lot of good things on the Hill\u2019s business. It\u2019s allowing us to build more flex in the middle of the P&L. We continue to find ways to truly optimize that supply chain and build more positive variances to those factories. Secondly, it\u2019s allowing us to obviously expand into higher growth segments in the wet segment, which we saw a nice growth in the wet business in quarter and continuing to drive overall share in that segment. So it\u2019s giving us a lot more flexibility. There\u2019s more work to be done. We\u2019ll continue to obviously be very, very diligent about how we think about allocating volumes across the world and addressing some of the growth opportunities that we see, particularly internationally. But overall, a terrific quarter and the supply chain team at Hill\u2019s is doing just an exceptional job integrating the new facilities and finding ways to really optimize the network. Operator : The next question comes Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. So I have just maybe one point of clarification and then a question. And the clarifying, Noel, I think earlier you talked a little bit about gross profit dollars and gross dollar profit growth. And I think it's maybe created a little bit of a question about whether there's a signal here that the focus maybe more shifting to gross profit dollar growth versus gross margin percentages. And I know you've had a view on that in the past, so if you could just sort of clarify that? Just is there any sort of message that you're trying to send or we still leave gross margin expand? Noel Wallace : Yeah. Let me maybe throw it to Stan, Bryan. No message whatsoever here. We could -- as I think we've been quite consistent, we understand the importance of gross margin, both gross margin percent and gross margin dollars. Encouragingly, in the quarter, we saw both and that's important for us. But again, as we strategically look at the growth opportunities, whether it's innovation, geographically, we're thoughtfully thinking through exactly how the impacts on gross margin will be. But ultimately, what we're looking for is our ability to continue to drive gross margin dollars to invest in the business. And it's hard to get there without gross margin percent. We're not just going to chase volume to drive dollars is what I'm saying, it has to be very deliberate choice. But let me give it to Stan, he can provide a little bit more color. Stanley Sutula : Yeah, Bryan. So first of all, it is obviously a combination of the two. And if you think about the business, we have -- you saw a great margin improvement in a number of businesses, particularly in Hill's. And as we look, the only part we're trying to -- point we're trying to make is how we deliver that margin improvement in those -- in that dollar growth is going to shift. So pricing will be less of a benefit, volume has been a help here going in and productivity will continue to be a driver as we look at that. But obviously, as we look at both margin and dollars it's a combination of both. And that is part of our overall business model on how we drive the investment back into the business and deliver top and bottom line growth. John Faucher : Bryan, if I can just add one point to Stan's point. The bottom line growth piece, key, right? We need EPS growth in dollars, right, because that's what creates long-term TSR at the top end of our peer group. So we talk about organic sales growth, but we're focused on driving dollar-based sales growth. We talked about driving gross margin percentage, but we also know we need to drive those gross profit dollars to drive EPS growth in dollars to drive TSR. So it's a very thoughtful way to look at it, but as Stan said, you need both to drive that bottom line growth. Operator : The next question comes from Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Korinne Wolfmeyer : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to get a little bit more clarity on some of the dynamics that were going on in North America in the quarter. I mean it sounds like some shipments were pushed from Q3 to Q4. Can you just clarify what that was due to? And then the pullback in the eCommerce, what that was attributable to? And then how should we be thinking about some of the macro dynamics in Q4, especially in the U.S. as some retailers are talking about pulling back into orders? Thank you. A \u2013 Noel Wallace : Yeah, Korinne. Thank you. Again, we talked about three specific things. Obviously, there\u2019s some shipment timing that moved from third to the fourth quarter, that was just due to some disruptions in our network and ultimately getting that order out in time. But ultimately, it will move into the fourth quarter. But nothing systemic there that we feel would be reoccurring. The eCommerce issue was specifically on the skin health business. We\u2019ve seen a little \u2013 obviously, there\u2019s some softness coming out of Asia, specifically China. But this one was more specific to the U.S. market, where we saw some of our big online retailers pull back a little bit on orders at the end of the quarter. We think those were inventory adjustments more than anything. But in any case, we need to watch that carefully and see if that\u2019s going to be sustained or not moving forward. And overall, the macro dynamics in the North America, I would say, more stabilization. We haven\u2019t seen anything deeply unusual on the promotion side. I think the percent sold on promotion is more or less pretty consistent. Still not back to where it was, as high as it was, pre-COVID. So overall, I would say more normalization, as I did mention, a little higher redemption rates coming through on couponing, and a little bit more broad-based activity in terms of the number of promotions. But overall depth and proportion to what we\u2019ve seen in the past seems pretty normalized right now. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask Noel on Skin Care. I guess, first, just mechanically and following up to Dara in North America, are you able to quantify how much of a drag the restatement was on growth in that segment this quarter to the extent that it was? But then more generally, I guess, you've talked a little bit about it, but maybe could you expand on what you're seeing in skin care trends across key markets because I'm assuming there's a good deal of variability. And do any of the reporting structure changes that you've made this year carried with them give some strategy with respect to how you approach Skin Care or skin health opportunities longer term? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks, Steve. So overall, let me just generalize. North America was, with the order changes and the skin, if you take skin out was closer to flat for the quarter. But I'm not going to quantify any more specifics on that. But specifically around the skin sector, I think you've heard from others, there's been some sluggishness, particularly in Asia. Likewise in Europe, and to a certain extent in the U.S. as well. So we're not necessarily immune to that. But what we have been doing very specifically is we are thinking about that business quite differently. We brought in some outside talent, somebody with over 20 years\u2019 experience at L\u2019Oreal. We\u2019re getting very clear and articulate about what we \u2013 where we want to compete and how we want to compete in that space. We feel very good about that organization now being much more centralized here in the U.S. in order to drive global decisions from the center and making very deliberate choices on how you invest and where we invest. We had to clean up some of the market expansion opportunities there that we didn\u2019t think were sustainable for the business. But overall, the economics and long-term health aspects of where we see that business growing continue to be very favorable. And we\u2019re encouraged, obviously, by the long-term strategy. We\u2019ve got some short-term issues with, obviously, Asia and some of the softness that we\u2019re seeing in some of the European markets to address. But overall, again, we feel the strategy we\u2019re putting in place will get us back to the sustained growth that we expect. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to go back to U.S. Oral Care and kind of ask more of a deep dive question there. So as we look at the market trends over a long period of time, there were four or five quarters where it was actually growth '22 to '23 (ph). But largely, it's been in a decelerating or share loss situation going back quite a long time. I guess the question is, what contributes to that period of outperformance? What has contributed to this state of back to share loss? And maybe if you kind of like a deep dive on what you think competitors are doing well, where they're gaining share? Where do you think Colgate could do a better job from a share perspective and how do you broadly kind of think about it? Because I know there's a lot of thought innovation around this total relaunch is to refocus on whitening, and yet, the general trajectory remains kind of where it is? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Listen, overall, shares are roughly flat, down 20 basis points on toothpaste and up on toothbrushes. And clearly, we\u2019ve seen some impact of our refocus on some of the untracked channels that we\u2019ve had over the last couple of years and seeing good performance in those untracked channels. So overall, business is good. It\u2019s not exactly where we want it right now, and we\u2019re very focused on getting the innovation strategy dialed up. We\u2019ve got to get the premiumization side of that business addressed. We\u2019ve got strong core businesses that we\u2019re seeing benefited as you see the consumer to a certain extent, some of the consumers trading more into the mid-tier. But overall, it\u2019s getting the premiumization side of the business addressed moving forward. And we\u2019re very focused on that in the strategy. Toothbrush business continues to perform very, very well. So again, putting more investment into that market, getting the innovation right, executing the fundamentals around distribution and shelf sets, all the basics that we think are necessary. And the plans that we have in \u201825 were some of the big core relaunches that were not privy to talk about, we think we\u2019re set up for stronger success moving forward. We\u2019ve seen some, again, choppiness with some of the retail environments, particularly the drug class of trade, where we hire shares, has struggled to drive traffic and turn in their retail environment. So we\u2019re having to shift accordingly. But we still feel the channel long term provides a growth opportunity for us, but you\u2019ve seen some sluggishness in that retail environment in the short term. Operator : Our last question today comes from Edward Lewis with Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead. Edward Lewis : Yeah. Thanks very much. I guess just looking back when you launched your sort of new strategy a few years ago. You talked about the core product of CPG doing a lot around that. You talked about adjacent categories. And you also talked about adjacent channels, the opportunities there. And just looking at the results today, I mean, we've seen the success for a number of years now on eCommerce in China. But how much of the channel mix changed in regions like, say, Latin America and Asia, ex-China relative to where it was before? And how much is that helping the success you're seeing with the premiumization strategy? Noel Wallace : Yeah. Good morning, Ed. Thank you. Interesting question. It's back on the channel expansion. I mean the initial focus on that was predominantly eCommerce, but we identified real unique opportunities in the expansion of very innovative discount formats around the world. The expansion of the club store format in certain parts of the world, you're seeing club stores particularly in Asia, and more specifically, China, grow quite significantly a couple of years. So it's making sure that as we think strategically around where we want to invest, we're investing in those retailers that are going to drive long-term growth for the business. And we've been very quick to adopt to new formats. And that's been one of the successes we've had here in North America when we initially guided to the Dollar Stores decades ago and ultimately, we've got strong leads there. But it's making sure that we are working with our retailers, all of our retailers to bring products to drive innovative growth for their sectors. And that's the key focus for us, category growth across all channels. And making sure that as we see new retail environments come on stream, that we're thinking very thoughtfully on how to do that in a way that drives growth for our retailers for the category and for the whole market. So I think it's just being very attuned to what we're seeing in the markets. You're seeing a lot of very innovative things happening at the retailer level. I think that's to be expected given some of the challenges in the move to eCommerce. So there's big box retailers that are having to change their shopping experience. And we're very much working in tandem with them to ensure that we have the products they need, the price pack architectures and configurations that they need in order to drive excitement at the shelf. Operator : This concludes the Q&A portion. Noel Wallace : Thanks. Thanks to everyone. Again, a strong quarter. We're having a good year so far through three quarters. Net sales were up 4.5%. Organic, up 8.5%. With again, a very strong balance between volume at 3.3% and pricing at 5.2%, and EPS double-digit on a year-to-date basis. And importantly, getting that flexibility across the income statement and the balance sheet. But this is the hard work of Colgate people all around the world aligned to our growth strategy and executing extraordinarily well. So thanks, everyone, for the questions today, and thanks to all the Colgate people for delivering a strong quarter. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's call.

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I'd like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Executive Vice President, M&A, John Faucher. John Faucher : Thanks, Betsy. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and are made on the basis of our views and assumptions at this time. Please refer to our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings press release and related prepared materials, and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2023 annual report on Form 10-K, and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some his thoughts on our results and our 2025 outlook and then we'll open it up for Q&A. Noel? Noel Wallace : Great. Thanks, John, and good morning everyone, and thank you all for joining us today as we discuss our 2024 results as well as our outlook for 2025. Let me make a few points on 2024 before I tell you why we continue to be very confident in our ability to deliver against our goals for this year. I couldn't be prouder of the results of the Colgate team that they delivered in 2024, which drove strong growth and exceeded our initial financial guidance. Net sales of $20 billion in 2024, which is one year ahead of our strategic plan ambition. This was driven by our sixth consecutive year of organic sales growth either in line or ahead of our long-term target of 3% to 5%. We delivered high-single-digit organic growth in 2024 on top of high-single-digit growth in 2023. We delivered pricing and volume growth in all four quarters. For the year, we grew volume in every division and in every category. We're focused on driving household penetration, which we believe is the best way to deliver long-term sustainable growth. We had another year of increased advertising spending up 15% and up 130 basis points as a percentage of sales. This increase, which is on top of 19% increase in 2023 is driving significantly improved brand health. Our third consecutive year of global toothpaste category value share growth highlights that our strategy of driving category growth in order to drive market share growth. Our strategy to build and scale our innovation capabilities is paying off as well as the incremental sales contribution from innovation has risen by 45% from 2021 to 2024. We delivered gross and operating margin expansion despite significant foreign exchange headwinds and the increased spending on advertising, compensation and capabilities through another year of strong productivity, particularly for our funding the growth initiatives. Double-digit based earnings per share growth ahead of our initial guidance despite incremental foreign exchange headwinds on both the net sales line and in gross margin. Record operating cash and free cash flow, record cash return to shareholders along with continued improvement in our top tier return on invested capital. So another very strong year, but let me now move on to 2025. In 2025, we'll see many of the same challenges and opportunities. All through 2024, I have been speaking to you about how our strategy was designed so that we could deliver in 2025 and beyond by investing in future growth, building more flexibility into our P&L and strengthening our balance sheet. The strong investment levels behind advertising and innovation and the continued improvement in returns on that spending give us confidence in our ability to continue to drive volume through household penetration. The increased investment is also improving brand health. As I will discuss at CAGNY next month, higher brand health is the key to our revenue growth management strategy, which will be key to sustaining pricing growth in a less inflationary environment. We will deliver another year of strong innovation led by the re-launch of Colgate Total with superior new offerings in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes and mouthwash. Our investments in data, analytics and AI will also be key to driving pricing growth in 2025. We utilized our strong gross profit growth in 2023 and 2024 to invest ahead of the curve and capabilities, which also give us additional flexibility to control SG&A spending going forward. Our strong cash flow gives us additional leverage for EPS growth through debt paid out to lower interest expense or share repurchases, even as we continue to invest in our business for growth and productivity. So we enter 2025 confident in our strategy and in our ability to deliver consistent compounded growth to deliver on our guidance and drive strong total shareholder return. So with that, I'll hand it over to you for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning guys. Noel Wallace : Good morning Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So just want a bit more clarity around the 2025 guidance relative to Q4, EPS guidance for all-in low-single-digit to mid-single-digit growth is pretty robust considering the onerous FX impact. So just what gives you confidence in such a strong implied local FX earnings growth? Number one. And then two, maybe we can drill down specifically into the OSG line. Obviously, that's a key driver of earnings growth. Q4 is weaker than we have seen in recent quarters, if you adjust for Argentina, the pet private label drag probably somewhere in that close to 4% OSG range, slower than the prior pace. So just as we think about the 3% to 5% guidance for 2025, maybe highlight your level of confidence relative to that Q4 result and maybe what the key points are of uncertainty are either positive or negative? Noel Wallace : Yes. Good morning, Dara. Thank you. So let me start off with the guidance. As I think I alluded to in my upfront comments, we continue to believe we are very well positioned to continue delivering consistent compounded dollar earnings growth. You've heard me talk about a lot about that over the last couple of years. That's reflected in our guidance and the strength quite frankly of the fundamentals that as you go through our P&L as well as the balance sheet. I've spoken many times to all of you about building flexibility into our plans and that was very much inherent as we looked at our 2025 strategy back in 2020. How do we get more flex into the P&L as we pivot to a much more growth mindset oriented organization. And that's exactly what we've done. So our top line focus will continue with balanced growth in both volume and price. And you've seen that consistently throughout the year in 2024. We believe we'll continue to deliver balanced growth in 2025. We saw volume and pricing growth across all of our categories this year, which is I think a terrific proxy for how we're building the health of those businesses moving forward. So in the context of 3% to 5%, we feel really good about that. We think it will continue to be at the top end of our peer group and it's reflected in the comfort we have in the health of the business overall. You look at market shares consistently up over the last couple of years. You look at the performance across multiple divisions being consistently up quarter-to-quarter. So the health of the business is there. If I move down to P&L, we continue to invest as I mentioned ahead of our capabilities. So we put a lot of money in the last couple of years in building capabilities that we think will allow us to sustain more consistent top line growth. We've reoriented the organization to really focus on dollar earnings growth and making sure that we're looking for ways to offset foreign exchange. No question that will continue to be a headwind, but we believe we've got more opportunities to offset that with other areas within the P&L. The strong cash generation is another area to look to. We've been consistent about building more cash, lowering our working capital to ensure that we have more flex across other areas below the operating margin line in the P&L. So overall, I think that underlying health of the business is in a really good place. Now, if I come back to your organic growth question, 4.3%, you look almost 5% in the fourth quarter, if you exclude private label, which we think is a more honest way to look at our business given the underlying base business being quite strong. And we think 5% in the current market environment is actually a really good number. Now we have plans to continue to develop the opportunities that we see ahead of us, but 5% in the fourth quarter, we feel pretty good about. Particularly on the volume side, almost 3% excluding private label, a little bit softer in some parts of Europe that we saw as we exited the quarter, particularly some of the softness we saw and continued softness in China behind our skin health business, but overall good volume growth. And we've been talking to you more about a normalization moving away from pricing growth in the P&L to more volume growth and that's consistent with what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. We did have less pricing from Argentina in the quarter, which we've talked about in our prepared comments. It was about 100 basis points less than we had in the first three quarters of the year, but we are still getting positive pricing and we've announced more pricing to offset some of the foreign exchange headwinds that we're seeing in Latin America already here in the first quarter. So if I come back to the underlying confidence that we have strong P&L flexibility, good balance sheet. The health of the brands is in a much better place than it's been. Market shares continue to inflect positively for the business. And overall, we're seeing a stabilization of the categories and hopefully we'll see the growth come back as we move through 2025. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Please go ahead. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. So I was just hoping to get some color on the gross margin performance in the quarter and kind of the cadence from here. Obviously, we weren't going to have sequential progress continuously, but it was the first time in a couple of years that hasn't happened. So I just would be curious how gross margin fared versus kind of your expectations. And then just looking ahead, I understand you expect another year of expansion, but just would be curious, if you could or it would be helpful if you could frame the path from here considering the exit rate? And then just within that, any color you can share on funding the growth just given what was a very strong year in 2024? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes, good morning, Peter. Thanks. So let me just level set us here. We're up 70 basis points versus year ago with significant foreign exchange headwind. So again, another quarter north of 60% and I think overall we feel pretty good about that, slightly below where we were hoping given the transactional impact that moved through the P&L as we exited the quarter. But overall, the underlying margin driven by pricing, strong productivity through funding the growth continues to be very good. So we feel pretty good about where we ended up. And as I mentioned earlier, that we have taken some pricing in Latin America to begin to offset some of the foreign exchange headwinds we've seen. But let me turn it over to Stan, who'll give you a little bit more color on how we're thinking about the trajectory of gross margin and our confidence to be able to grow gross margin in 2025. Stanley Sutula : Thanks, Joel. So Peter, we mentioned that we did all four quarters above 60% and we're up 70 basis points in fourth quarter. So we're happy with the margin expansion. And as we look ahead, there are several items that I think will help us as we go to drive that margin expansion. One is simply going to be mix. As we grow Hill's and we grow Oral Care, we get a positive mix as those are two of our more profitable businesses. So you combine that with less private label, which has a very low margin, you get a mix benefit going forward. You mentioned our funding-the-growth program, our productivity program long established extraordinarily well run by the teams. We've been planning on this for many months now heading into '25. So I think we're off to a good start on funding-the-growth. One of the capabilities Joel mentioned as we've made investments in is in some of our new capabilities and we have revenue growth management what we call 2.0 as we go to drive better performance on our revenue growth management. We have good innovation pipelines across the business coming in. And I think the combination of those will help us with expanding margin in 2025. Now as private label slowly mixes off, you'll see that go through the year, but we are confident in the ability to expand margin in 2025. Noel Wallace : And then one other add, Peter, would be that we've seen a more moderating raw material environment. We'll watch that carefully. But relative to how we entered 2024, we seem to have better visibilities to where raw materials are going at this stage. Operator : The next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you. Good morning. I actually had a question on your North America business. Pricing was negative last year and then segment volumes didn't necessarily benefit, I guess, in the back half of the year. So as we think about this year, how should we think about the contribution from price versus volume mix in North America? And then is it reasonable to assume that price contribution remains negative? And in that context, could you touch on the promotional environment and I guess how it compares relative to your expectations across your different categories in the market? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Thanks, Bonnie, and good morning. Again, as we talked about back in the second quarter and some of the price adjustments we made to the business, which we think have helped improve the underlying health and certainly some of the strong volume performance we've had in the US continue to filter through the third and the fourth quarter. We'll see that kind of taper away as we move through the back half of 2025, but those prices adjustments are there. I would say that both volume and price sequentially improved in the fourth quarter as we exited the year in North America. I would also remind everyone that the segmentation that we have now includes the skin health business in North America as of the third quarter that we added that in there. And we did see a lot of softness in volume and price coming out of our skin business in China, which has been pretty consistent theme throughout the year. But overall, North America, if you take the underlying business, Oral, Personal and Home Care performed quite well. We saw, as I mentioned, sequential improvement. We saw some benefits from some of the shipment timing that we had this year versus last year and the volume performance ex-skin was very strong across the North America business. But that being said, we do have more work to do. We're still continuing to look at our go-to market strategies and our investment posture in the US. We continue to believe it's a strategic growth opportunity for the company and we will continue to invest in that business. We have new leadership in place, which we're excited about some of the strategic thinking that's coming from behind that. The exiting of the year saw some green shoots particularly in some of the categories including toothpaste, liquid hand soap and dish, particularly in some of the latter categories, which had been a headwind to us in the first part of the year. So we feel good about where we are from a strategic standpoint and from a growth standpoint. So overall pricing will improve, particularly as we move through the back half of 2025. Operator : The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Good morning. I just wanted to kind of like elaborate a little bit more if you can on the pricing front, what you're expecting on the FX driven pricing. You mentioned Latin America you took pricing. And if you are seeing anything in regards to some of the places where you have effects as well in Europe in terms of like how it fits into your guidance? And then related to that also on the volume, sorry, just to clarify, if it's mostly driven the volume components that you were seeing into 2025, where is going to be the most I mean the areas that you see the volume kind of like being positive on the algorithm from the 3% to 5% what's going to be the green shoots you're seeing? I'm assuming Hill's and some of the strength that you're seeing in Colgate Total as well. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Sure. Great. Good morning, Andrea. So let me take the pricing question first. Obviously, I talked about offsetting foreign exchange and we'll continue to see some opportunities across the world, particularly in Latin America. But there are other markets across Africa that we will be taking pricing to offset some of the foreign exchange headwinds that we see moving into the year. Europe on the other hand will continue its value oriented pricing strategy, which is very much driven by a significant improvement in our innovation and the quality of our innovation to drive more pricing and value back into the categories. That was successfully deployed back in 2023 and throughout 2024. So we'll continue to make sure that we're bringing pricing into the category through some of the value oriented initiatives that we have. And as Stan mentioned, that will continue to be a key theme for all of our divisions as we increase our innovation. You heard me talk about the incrementality we're getting from our innovation. So we feel we're in a much more solid footing relative to how we think about innovation and its ability to be accretive through our P&L both from a growth standpoint as well as a margin standpoint. In terms of volume, we'll continue to have balanced volume across the year. Now we've said that we expected a shift from a pricing driven algorithm and organic to a more volume driven organic, excuse me, more volume driven algorithm on organic and that's exactly what's happening. We're seeing that consistently across all of our divisions. A little softness on the Hill's category, but we've seen consumption start to improve as we enter 2025 on the categories. So that bodes well, but that's been a little softer, but we'll get into Hill's later, but an outstanding performance in a flat category. And ultimately we'll see that category hopefully inflect positive as we move through 2025, but volume will come across the board. Asia will continue to be a good volume contributor. Africa has been a great volume contributor and no question Latin America as well as North America. So it's going to be pretty broad-based across the board. If you look if you take a step back for a moment and look at our volume shares and again a testament to our focus on brand penetration, our volume shares continue to inflect very positively across most of the regions. So we feel very good about our ability to continue to drive penetration through some of the initiatives that we have. And largely that's driven by the underlying health of the brand, which are in a much better place than they were five years ago, given the support that we're putting behind the business. Operator : The next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hey, everyone. Good morning. Noel, you mentioned, you will talk about Hill's later, maybe we talk about it a bit now. If you could just talk a bit about the what's going on with volumes, particularly in Europe, is this something cyclical? Is there anything else changing? Just any more details would be useful. And then on RGM 2.0, perhaps just a little bit more on what that means, what you're able to do now versus what you were doing with RGM before? I think those would be helpful. Thanks. Noel Wallace : Yes, great. And good morning to you Kaumil. So again Hill's continues to really execute against the strategy that we outlined three or four years ago. So obviously the volume was impacted by the impact of private label. So about a 200 basis points impact from the drag on private label. So overall a 3% volume growth on that business in a roughly flat category right now, we think is very, very strong. I'll start off with market shares on Hill's consistently one of the fastest growing brands in pet specialty. We continue to see strong share growth across other channels, great e-commerce growth, back to growth on prescription diet, which had been a drag on the business historically and that bodes well for mix and margin. So overall, the business is in a very, very good place and the fundamentals in terms of how we're executing against some of our strategies. We talked about the segment opportunities that we see in small pet. We talked about the segment growth opportunities we've seen in cat as well as wet. We feel we're right on pace with where we expected to be and see more opportunities to continue to execute those volume opportunities as we move forward. And those are more higher ASP opportunities, which will translate through the P&L as well. The supply chain is in a much better shape as well. We've talked about making sure that we really optimize our network and we're doing exactly that. The Tonganoxie ramp up, which will be our most automated facility in the world continues to go as expected. So, overall, we're in a -- we feel like we're in a good place. The category was a little soft in Europe. We don't think it's anything unusual to be too worried about, but obviously we're very focused on make sure that we go after those under index growth segments where we're not getting our fair share, where we now have strategies in place and innovation in place to actually capture that growth and that will help us offset. So within the context of the overall category, we are outperforming most of our competitors and we feel very good about where the business is going and the trajectory of that as we move into 2025. Stanley Sutula : So let me pick up on the second part of the question around RGM 2.0 and you've heard us talk over the last few years about investing in capabilities. That's really what comes home to 2.0 and things like analytics and digital and data. We leverage those skills and those new capabilities to come into design our pricing strategy and market by product, our promotion strategy and timing. And we've seen some really great returns and customer feedback around those. So it's really taking an already talented workforce here enabling them with new capabilities and new skills that allows us to be more effective. When you combine that with innovation that we bring to market, it's pretty powerful end market. So we're comfortable that RGM is going to continue to contribute both to margin and to top line. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Grundy with BNP. Please go ahead. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Noel Wallace : Good morning, Kevin. Kevin Grundy : Noel, I was hoping to comment. Good morning, Joel. On advertising levels broadly. So you guys have done an outstanding job here over the past couple of years of increasing A&M levels. Of course, that's been funded by gross margin increases. But now with the things slowing down a bit, the expectation is that advertising and marketing levels are going to be relatively flattish year-over-year, right? So said differently maintained as a percent of sales. So how will you potentially weighing as you're putting the plan together, further increasing A&M levels as a percent of sales to the extent you could accelerate top line growth, further gain market share relative to margin and earnings growth expectations, just because the returns you've been getting in recent years have been so strong and further increasing. So broad context, I think on that front would be helpful. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes, great, Kevin. I think the top line comment here is that we are very focused with a lot of our tech platforms and the work that we're doing around programmatic media personalization through data to really optimize and continue to find ways to be more precise with our spending that we've obviously gotten in a much better place than we were years back as you mentioned up 9% this quarter on top of 80% in the year ago. So we're in a much, much healthier place. And if you take all of the metrics that we use to assess brand health, which ultimately is the most important proxy and whether your advertising is working or not. And we continue to see very strong inflections on the strength of our brands around the world. We do have unique opportunities in certain parts of the world to continue to improve that, but in general a much better place than we've been. We're being far more deliberate with our advertising spend. And what I mean by that is more choiceful on the opportunities that we see in terms of driving category growth and growth for the Colgate franchise. And so we've been, I think, quite successful in earmarking money to certain parts of the world and in certain categories where we're seeing a much better ROI. I can't get into a lot of specifics, but you heard us back talk over the last couple of years on how we're using data analytics and our digital transformation has really unlocked a lot more efficiency in our spend and our ROIs have continued to improve sequentially. So as we move into 2025, it's really about continuing to make sure we're optimizing the growth and the spending that we've had and be more precise and tactical with how we think about using that money or more strategic on how we use that money across the board. So it will be efficiency, technology and making sure we find ways to optimize that spend in the areas where we're going to get the best return on investment. Operator : The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Hi. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. So just, I guess, we'd like to get your perspective on two quick things. One, Noel, just trying to put the 3% to 5% organic sales growth forecast for '25 in the context. Is this where does that stand relative to kind of where category growth is as we're exiting 4Q. So one just kind of your growth rate expectations relative to the category geographies? And then the second, just since because it's topical within the headline tariffs, I think in the prepared remarks you talked a bit about evaluating once you know but as we're thinking about tariffs, just because we're all going to try to put some probabilities on it and run some things through our model, just some basics that we should be paying attention to as we're thinking about this topic, just relative how size it could be, I don't know. Anything you could give us as an input would be helpful. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes, good morning, Bryan. Great, I'll take the first part of the question and I'll let Stan talk about a lot of the great strategic work that we've been doing over the last couple of years to truly optimize our supply chain for more resilience and potential disruption. So if I take the category growth rates right now, we've seen I think the good news is we've seen more of a stabilization. We saw some falloff in the categories as we move through. I think the additive impacts of inflationary pricing over the last year and a half, but we've seen a more stabilization of the categories and which is good news. So categories in general, the categories in which we compete are growing 2% to 4%. So relative to our organic algorithm of 3% to 5%, we will be outpacing the categories and hopefully continuing to drive brand penetration and share growth. So I think the overarching comment is we've seen some stabilization in the categories based on some of the falloffs that we had seen in the third quarter and into the early part of the fourth quarter. And we have, we believe the right innovation, the right pricing and mechanisms in place to continue to outpace the categories. Stanley Sutula : Good morning, Bryan. On tariffs, as we said in the commentary, we've not included any potential incremental tariffs in our '25 guidance, but we've tried to put the tariffs in context of our long-term supply chain strategy. So primarily we aim to have local manufacturing as a cost of shipping some of our products across long distances can be material. We spent the last few years building much more flexibility into our global supply chain, not necessarily about building more capacity, but rather making better use of the existing capacity and alternative sourcing as well as standardizing formulas across the markets. So importantly, we've invested meaningfully in our US supply chain, almost $2 billion over the last five years between investment in our Oral, Personal, Home Care business, along with the purchase of pet food capacity, the opening of our Tonganoxie wet pet food facility. We've increased the number of our US based manufacturing facilities by more than 40% over that time. So material investment into US capabilities. And let me give an example of some of our improved flexibility. While we had available machine manual toothbrush capacity outside of China in '21, we were limited in which SKUs we could actually produce in which plants. We can now produce more SKUs at more plants. So we have the same amount of capacity, but we can meet more customer and consumer needs from more geographic locations. And this philosophy gives us better flexibility as we enter a period with potentially higher tariffs. And we also have additional co-man capacity to provide flexibility. Now we do produce some of our products for the US in Mexico, primarily toothpaste, and we're working on potential mitigation plans, which can impact both raw materials and finished products. On raw materials, we import a limited amount of raw materials, predominantly specialty type ingredients like vitamins and amino acids. And as you would expect, we're planning for multiple scenarios, because it's not just the tariff that may be on Mexico or Canada or China, it's the impact of retaliatory tariffs that would also come into play on those supply chain. So we're looking at very tactical short-term, mid-term and long-term if necessary actions. But until we get more clarity, we have not included anything in our guidance. Operator : The next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I want to talk through what you expect to be the volume implications of the pricing you're planning to take given the decel in volume in Q4. If you could talk to order of magnitude on the LatAm pricing, whether you've already implemented this. And if you're planning to price in other regions or whether the competitive or macro dynamics make that more difficult to push through. And then just you talked about advertising and being up -- being flat to up. What about promotion and your ability, if necessary, to pivot between advertising and promotion? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes. Good morning, Olivia. Thank you. So let me take the latter part of the question first. The promotional spending has been, I think, quite constructive. We have seen some pockets of increased competitive activity. India was one where we saw heightened competition in spending in the fourth quarter. You probably saw that in the press release from the India results. We've seen some heightened competitive activity in South Africa as well. But more or less pretty constant across the quarter. US continues to be quite constructive, no significant changes there. So on balance, I would say the promotional environment continues to be as we would have expected, with some isolated pockets of increased activity, which we addressed in our statements earlier. So overall we feel we're in a pretty good place. But my expectation is you continue to move from a pricing to a volume environment, you may see more promotion. But we plan for that in our guidance and plan for that in our plans for 2025. Relative to Latin American pricing, as I mentioned, we've announced some pricing already in Latin America relative to some of the foreign exchange headwinds and we'll continue to watch that very carefully. We did not anticipate another significant devaluation in Argentina this year in our guidance or in our numbers. That may or may not happen. We will adjust that accordingly. I think it's worth saying that despite the significant foreign exchange headwinds we saw in Argentina, we did grow dollar earnings in Argentina, which I think is a great proxy to our ability to offset some of the transactional impact that we see as we move through foreign exchange. As I mentioned earlier, Europe is a little bit more challenging to do that. So we pivoted from price increases to really driving meaningful innovation that can drive value in the categories and ultimately drive some accretion on the margin line and the pricing line. And we'll continue to adopt that strategy overall. Operator : The next question comes from Sergio Matsumoto with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Sergio Matsumoto : Hi. Good morning. It's Sergio Matsumoto. I'm with Rob Moskow's team. Noel and Stan, in Latin America, how does the current macroeconomic headwinds like inflation is impacting the demand of the category? And with the new administration in the US, how does that change your operations in the local countries in terms of any pricing changes that you might make or innovation? Noel Wallace : Yes. Good morning, Sergio, thanks for the question. So as you well know, we've been in Latin America for 75 plus years. In fact, I'll be going down to Mexico in June to celebrate our 100 year anniversary in Mexico, which is a great milestone for us and for the Mexican company, which has been one of our most successful businesses in the world given our long-standing presence in those markets. Overall, we have dealt with a significant amount of volatility in Latin America over the last couple of decades. And so we're accustomed to obviously both political and economic disruptions and our ability to offset that with meaningful innovation and execution against the fundamentals that will ultimately drive category growth and our business. We've seen that consistently throughout this year as well. Latin America performance continues to be very, very strong. It slowed a little bit in the fourth quarter, but that was more due to some of the pricing that I mentioned earlier that was in the year-ago number in Argentina were through the first three quarters that we didn't necessarily have in the fourth quarter this year. But if I take our two biggest markets and characterize those perhaps in terms of categories and how we're doing, Mexico and Brazil, we had good quarters for both of those businesses. I'll start with market shares. Market shares are absolutely terrific in both of those markets. Volume and value shares are up. Overall, in Latin America, we had 8 of 10 countries up or flat in market share. Nine or 10 of those markets are up or flat in volume. So overall, the underlying health of the business continues to be very strong, and we're outpacing the categories in terms of our consumption. So from the perspective of categories, we saw a little slowdown, as we talked about in the third quarter around Mexico. But that business seems to have stabilized and we've seen better consumption as we've entered 2025. So overall, we think we're in a good place, but we're not immune to, obviously, the continued volatility around foreign exchange and the movements in terms of statements that are made with various countries. So we'll continue to execute against what we can control and that's the fundamentals of the business and making sure that we have flexibility through the P&L. Operator : The next question comes from Christopher Carey with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Christopher Carey : Hi. Good morning, everyone. You had mentioned some competitive activity in different markets globally, China joint venture, India, Africa, Eurasia. You didn't mention North America, but there's been some pricing investments. Can you expand a bit more on some of the end-market competitive activity you're seeing with some specificity on specific markets that you called out? Thanks so much. Noel Wallace : Sure. Good morning, Chris. It's not unusual in terms of the heightened competitive activity as some of the manufacturers, particularly local players, are chasing more volume in their categories. We've been very selective on where we're going to address that, and we'll be sure to make sure we protect the health of the brands as we do that. But it was very isolated to a few markets around the world. India was probably the most notable with a significant increase in competitive activity in the urban space particularly in the modern trade where we saw a multitude of competitors discounting more to drive volume. We addressed some of that, which was reflected in the quarter. But we anticipate India will stabilize and get more rational as we move through the balance of the year. We've got good innovation plans and good focus on really driving some retail strategies that we think will allow us to offset some of that competitive activity and continue to drive share market and drive category growth. Turkey and South Africa were more isolated to some competitive activity there. We don't necessarily see that sustaining itself through the year, but we're well prepared as we mentioned in the guidance to address that if we need to. So overall, there's nothing terribly unusual. As I mentioned earlier, where we see a more constructive promotional environment, Europe would be an area where you might see heightened competitive activity, but we're seeing that be pretty consistent and we're growing significant market share in Europe as well. So we feel we're in a good place. Again, if you see more competitive promotion activity, the most important aspect for us is the underlying health of the business in a place we can continue to launch innovation to drive value and drive market share growth both in volume and in dollars and we're consistently seeing that, particularly in our Oral Care business around the world. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Stephen Powers : Hi. Great. Good morning, everybody. I guess I wanted to ask about just the base case shape of the P&L in 2025. It's great to see the call for another year of gross margin improvement and at least stable A&P investment. But I guess I'm curious as to how much of the expected underlying operating income improvement is going to be driven by that gross margin versus SG&A reductions and SG&A efficiencies. And then within that sort of what I'm assuming is increased focus on SG&A. Do you think you're going to have enough flex to keep up other elements of investment? You talked about innovation investment, but digital, data analytics, talked about AI. Those have all been, I think, fruitful pockets of investment the last couple of years. Can you keep that up in 2025? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Hi. Good morning, Steve. Thanks. So again, I think the top line comment here is yes. While we've front-loaded a lot of that investment in '23 and '24, so we feel we're in a really good place, not necessarily having to play catch-up, there's going to continue -- we're going to continue to raise the bar and ensure we find ways to invest for the long-term health of the business, particularly around capabilities. And we have some exciting things underway in the data space, in the technology space as well that will continue to, we believe, drive more productivity through the P&L. But Steve, I come back to what we've been talking about and what was anchored in our 2025 strategy when we launched it six years ago. And that was ultimately getting all line items in the P&L in a place to give us more flexibility. And we're going to continue to really focus on doing that. There will be ebbs and flows in certain areas of the business that we have to address, but we need to have flexibility to go after the growth and fund that through various line items in the P&L. So from a capital structure in terms of where we put money, from a capability standpoint. It's really meant to go up and down the P&L as well as the balance sheet to ensure we have ways to continue to drive top-tier shareholder value. And we're going to do that with the consistency of performance and the health of the brands is an underpinning to that. So overall, we feel pretty good about where we are across the P&L. There will be some ebbs and flows as we move through the year. The year is an artificial construct as we say, we will continue to go after the opportunities as we see them. But in the absence of not having flexibility, that becomes very, very difficult to do. And we've shown, I think, over the last couple of years that having ways to flex certain aspects of the P&L and the balance sheet is the best way to drive long-term sustained growth. Stanley Sutula : The only thing I'd add there is, as we look at the entire P&L and the balance sheet, while we drive productivity, it's not just a cut for cut's sake. We actually spent a lot of time in our budgeting process on resource allocation, both dollars and people, and where do we want to reallocate to drive performance in the business. And that hits every line of the P&L. And then our balance sheet as we drive better payment terms, better net working capital efficiency, it gives us the ability to reduce debt, invest back in the business, which when you look at that holistically is the flex that we've talked about in managing this day-to-day. But we're confident in our ability to deliver on our guidance for '25. Noel Wallace : And I think the best proxy for that, at least that I shout a lot from here in New York is our return on invested capital. And that's really ensuring that we're using shareholder money in ways to drive the best return and to have the ROIC back in the 35%, 36%, I think, is a good example of us being very selective, as Stan says, to drive spending where we're going to get the best return on that investment. Operator : The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Noel, since you referenced 2025 strategy, we're starting 2025. So I was curious if you could talk a little bit about, I guess, thoughts on the next leg? Will you be announcing a kind of 2030 strategy? And maybe what are some of the areas that you think you would add to that list? What are areas where you still have opportunities to keep pushing on the things that have really been working? Thanks. Noel Wallace : Great. Good morning, Lauren. Thank you. I'm smiling here because we're on the eve of announcing our 2030 strategy that we'll be going through the organization with here in the next couple of months. We've been working tirelessly over the last year to really fine-tune that. We've taken the Board through that. And so we're quite excited. I mean, I think overall, the discipline around strategic planning in the company and I give the team tremendous credit for the work around that, has been excellent, and making sure that we continue to remind ourselves on the opportunity spaces that we have and the potential for continued growth to be sure that we're investing ahead of the curve in order to get there. And so that's exactly what we'll do as we unveil the 2030 strategy. Now there's always a temptation to throw out what you've had and put something new. I think the line that I would leave you with is consistency is really important to us. Execution and focus is really important to us. And the things that we've outlined as we launched our 2025 strategy about the growth mindset, about better innovation, about productivity up and down the P&L, about continued gross margin expansion, about investing in the health of our brands and optimizing our spending efficiency, all of that will be consistent as we move into the 2030 plan. There are areas that we think we can continue to dial up and sharpen. Innovation will be one of those, making sure that we continue to deliver the great incrementality that we're getting through the innovation. You heard me talk about the 45% more incremental sales coming from new products than we had historically. That's a big, big driver. You've heard me talk about in previous meetings that we've reoriented our incentive systems to get more after incremental innovation. So it's not just launching innovation for the sake of launching innovation, it's making sure it's driving incrementality to the category and to Colgate. So innovation will continue to be a big focus. Data and AI, we're excited about all the investments that we've made, both in training our organization, but really on the business use cases where we see the most -- best ways to optimize growth and efficiency through the P&L. That will be an interesting focus for us as well. And ultimately, as you look at the health orientation of our products, we will continue to rely heavily on our professional orientation and our ability to drive premiumization and loyalty behind strong endorsements and advocacy of our brands. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. First, just a quick follow-up. You called out in your prepared remarks increased price competition in China. So I was wondering if you could elaborate on that. And then my main question is on the Total relaunch. I'm wondering if, first, you can kind of size that compared to other relaunches, just so we have a sense of magnitude in importance. How are you defining success on the relaunch? Maybe some early reads in Latin America? And also perhaps what you may be doing differently on the marketing side to make it successful? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes. Good morning, Rob. Thank you. Let me just clarify. We didn't -- I don't believe we mentioned anything about increased competitive pricing in China specifically. We talked about obviously some softness perhaps on our Darlie business, which I'll address in just a moment. But the increase in heightened pricing is really in Asia was specifically related to India. And that's where we've seen most of the aggressive pricing. Overall, China, I would say, on balance, that the pricing environment is pretty stable. And our performance there is, quite frankly, quite good. We delivered positive organic growth in the quarter and that is with the Colgate business because it continues to operate extremely well. The Colgate business alone was up high-single-digit organic in China in the fourth quarter. And as you see that in comparison to a lot of our peer group, we feel we're executing extremely well with the new strategy that we've put in place three years ago. Now the Darlie business continues to be a challenge, although it's -- we feel we're getting better. We still have opportunities for some go-to-market changes in 2025. And we'll address that accordingly. But overall, we feel China will continue to be a slow growth, although we seem to be outpacing the category and our competition in many respects. But China continues to be difficult in the short to medium-term. But long-term, again, we value China and India as strategic growth opportunities for the company. China will put more or less $300 million of incremental middle-class consumers into the market by 2030. India will more than double that, probably $600 million to $700 million. So again, real long-term growth opportunities, so important to keep the health of the business and the investment profile in a place that we can obviously leverage that as we move forward. Total launch specifically on Total, Rob. We launched it in the fourth quarter in Latin America and we're in the midst of rolling that around the world. Latin America would be our best proxy. It is driving terrific share growth for Latin America. We've seen great performance across our core markets from the Latin America launch. We're rolling that out across Asia and North America and Europe as we speak. It is a meaningful upgrade in our formula, again, intended to really speak to prevention and the importance of prevention, which is obviously a key trend in the marketplace amongst consumers and looking for superior prevention in what they're asking for in a toothpaste. And we really elevated the focus on the science aspects of Colgate Total and getting a better formula into the market than we've had before across not only the toothpaste, but the toothbrush and the mouthwash, and creating real opportunities for category growth and regimen claims. So overall, we're very excited about the early signs that we're seeing in Latin America and intend to overly translate that across the world. Operator : The next question comes from Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Korinne Wolfmeyer : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to just get a little bit more color on the pet nutrition business for 2025 and kind of like the cadence over the next four quarters that we should expect both from the portfolio rationalization, innovation, pricing, et cetera? Any color on that would be helpful. Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes. Good morning. Again, the Hill's, as I mentioned earlier, the fundamentals of the business are really, really strong. Now we've seen, obviously, we've talked about a little bit of slowdown in the category, but that's stabilized, certainly not getting any worse. And we continue to execute extremely well in that category environment with market shares continuing to grow volume ex-private label up nicely, and we'll continue to see that, we believe, trajectory as we move through the balance of 2025. I'll let Stan talk a little bit about the private label impact as we think about 2025. But if I take just the underlying business, again, very focused on segment growth opportunities for the business, I mentioned. We obviously have a very strong dog and cat business that we need to excel in small paws or the small dog segment, which is the fastest-growing part of the market. We need to excel in the wet segments. We have a real focus on that. And we obviously need to get back to more sustained growth in Europe. But overall, the business continues to perform well. We operate a portfolio in a diverse mix of countries around the world. We have the ability to pull on those markets. I think our largest market, North America, continues to execute extremely well, had a good quarter in the fourth quarter. And we expect nothing unusual from the Hill's business as we move into 2025. Stanley Sutula : Look, I think the Hill's business is really well positioned, and it's based on really good execution by the team. They have done really well in a flattish category that we think will slowly improve through time. But the new innovation that they have coming to market, the wind-down of private label and the improved expansion, we think both will drive top line, but also, importantly, will drive margin expansion for that business. And I think they're in a nice position where they have enormous opportunities in numerous areas to go after to continue to expand. And I was just down at the VMX conference, which is the veterinary conference, with the North America team and extraordinarily well received down there with nearly 30,000 vet and vet techs attending that conference. And the Hill's booth was very well attended with great innovation and explaining the value that we bring. We've also invested over the last several years into our pet nutrition center and the science behind our diets, which I think will continue to bring that innovation to market. So I think Hill's is really well positioned heading into '25. We've got market expansion opportunities both in the US and abroad and a science-based profession driven product set. Noel Wallace : Yes. And if I can just add one more point is that we're seeing the margin inflection there. So you had talked to us a lot over the past couple of years about margin performance at Hill's. And what we've seen now is that margin has truly begun to inflect positively. And that's not just the private label mix. That's really on the underlying business. It's some of the mix improvements that Noel had talked about in terms of prescription diet, wet, et cetera. So as Stan mentioned, from a bottom line standpoint, the inflection is there and it really gives us the confidence that we can continue to invest back in this business. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Thanks and good morning everybody. I wanted to stay on the Hill's business for a minute. Broadly, it seems like there's been a bit more volatility in the pet food category than I think maybe people would have anticipated. Years ago, you talked a little bit about volatility. In this quarter, we saw a little bit of that kind of coming out as we lapped COVID comparisons, but whether it's pet adoption or the decreased usage of pet food periodically, which doesn't seem to make a ton of sense. I guess could you just opine a bit on what you think is adding to the category volatility? Is it all pricing that's been taken? And just more of a broader comment I guess specific to the US, maybe you could also just elaborate on how you think about the performance of the Hill's business by geography, if you don't want to give specifics, just broader strokes between US and international. And then just talk a bit about the competitive environment. There's clearly been some at least smaller kind of niche year categories becoming more mainstream. And how do you think about the adoption of that and the impact on your business over time? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Good morning, Mark. Thank you. So I think the importance here is staying in our swim lanes on this one. We see the fastest growing part of the category continued to be science based premium pet nutrition, and we're outpacing the category in that regard and helping to drive significantly more value into our retail partners. So the innovation that Stan talked about will continue to be focused on scientific, therapeutic variance and innovation that continue to drive a differentiation and real value orientation back to the pet owner moving forward. Yes, there's been some stabilization in the category. The category is flat. We mentioned that we're growing. We still see, as we look at it, yes, we'd like to see that start to inflect positive, which we expect will probably come towards the back half of 2025. But the segments that where we want to grow continue to afford significant upside potential for our business and our ability to continue to drive volume and price and profitability through the P&L. And I've talked about those segments. So we're very focused on that aspect. A lot of noise in the category, a lot of different things happening in the category. But strategically, the growth spaces and the swim lane, so to speak, where we want to compete, we continue to see nice growth opportunities for the business and sustain profitability as we've improved, as Stan and John mentioned, the underlying fundamentals in the P&L are in a much better shape than they were years back. Operator : The last question today comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please go ahead. Filippo Falorni : Hi, good morning everyone. Noel, you talked about building flexibility not only on the P&L but also on the balance sheet. So just curious on capital allocation and increased appetite potentially for share buybacks considering the share level. And then on M&A, big picture, can you remind us kind of your strategic areas of focus and parameters for M&A? Thank you. Noel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Filippo. So again, our prioritization around capital allocation is investing back behind the business to drive efficiency and growth. And again, I'll come back to the return on invested capital, we're seeing a great return as we invest back in the business and our ability to drive more top line growth and more savings through the P&L. Second, the share repurchases and dividends. You've seen the strong numbers. I'll let Stan maybe talk to that in just a moment. But what you've seen, obviously, our focus on driving top Tier TSR, not only through the growth of the earnings, but our ability to continue to find ways to reward our shareholders through our dividend policy, et cetera. So overall, we'll continue to focus on strong working capital cash generation to allow us to buy shares where appropriate and to continue to invest in our dividend based on Board approval. But overall, we feel like we're in a much better place to make sure we're providing different levers to drive shareholder return on a consistent basis. Stanley Sutula : When we go through our annual budgets and our execution, we have a theme that underlies all that, and that's growth, margin and cash. So cash is a fundamental part of how we run each of the businesses. And you've seen that drive in cash flow achieving $4.1 billion in operating cash flow, a record for us. But that gives us the ability to allocate those resources. And as we look at that, that stayed the same, as Noel said, which is invest back in the business. That can come in multiple forms. Return to shareholders, and then M&A, where we see the right opportunity that's aligned to our strategic direction because that helps give us a north star for where we want to invest and maybe what parts of the portfolio that might be better off somewhere else to drive long-term value for us. And you saw this year that we actually did increase our share buybacks. We did $1.1 billion net and return to shareholders was up over 20% year-to-year. And we have a long-standing dividend that we believe is competitive. And when we think about capital allocation, it starts with delivering the cash to enable that. And we're pretty comfortable with where we are. Proud of the team for a great ROIC and the ability to drive that into '25. Operator : The last question today comes from Edward Lewis with Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead. Edward Lewis : Yes. Thanks very much. Just looking at the European performance with the balance of 2024. And I thought it was notable to see you delivering both positive volume and positive price. I appreciate the move of skin into North America probably helps a bit there. But still, I thought that's quite a change from what we were accustomed to see. I know you don't necessarily split out where the marketing spend is going, but how much of the incremental marketing support has gone into Europe? And how much then does that give you the confidence to be able to sustain these accelerated growth trends as we go forward? Noel Wallace : Yes. Good morning, Ed. Thank you. Listen, I'm glad we're finishing up with Europe, because what a terrific performance they had in 2024 and another strong fourth quarter coming off of a strong year-to-date before that. Organic growth across all hubs for the quarter. Yes, we've seen some of the inflationary pricing we see, but we are getting pricing, as you mentioned, balanced pricing and volume growth in the quarter. I think a testament again to the real focus on our RGM analytics and how we're maximizing our promotional spend in those markets. Likewise, a really strong innovation, pipeline of products in '24, and you'll see that again in 2025 and our ability to drive more value oriented back into the categories, more price orientation. So that drives our price and the category at the same time. Good operating profit and margin performance is critical to sustain the advertising. Our advertising to sales was up about 220 basis points. So again, driving a lot of the brand health measures that we have. And I think what's most pleasing is the record market share performance we saw in Europe, particularly behind our Oral Care business, both on Colgate and Elmex. We're now up 300 basis points in market share versus where we were in 2016. And the shares as we exited the fourth quarter were at a record high particularly in some of our key geographies. So we feel very good about our ability to continue to drive organic growth in that market and drive operating profit growth given the health of the business. And that will be driven by innovation and a sustained level of advertising across multiple categories in Europe. Noel Wallace : So with that, thank you very much for your questions again. Let me end where I started, which is a profound thank you to the Colgate team. Surpassing $20 billion in sales for the first time in our 217 year history is an important milestone for the company. The continued health of the business and the continued improvements we've seen up and down the P&L and in our balance sheet is a real testament to the incredible organization of people that we have working day in and day out in an extremely volatile world out there. So I thank them. And I look forward to seeing everyone down in Florida, CAGNY. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's call. You may now disconnect.",
